Phoenix successfully landed in the frigid northern polar regions of Mars in 2008 in search of potential habitats for life and quickly discovered water ice and salty soils that could be favorable for the genesis and support of extraterrestrial life. InSight will intentionally land in a far warmer and sunnier location nearer the moderate climate of the equator to enable a projected lifetime of 2 years (or 1 Mars year) vs. the 5 months survival of Phoenix extremely harsh arctic touchdown zone. \"Our planned landing site is in Elysium Planitia,\" Banerdt told me. \"It was chosen for optimizing engineering safety margins for landing and power.\" The more equatorial landing site affords far more sun for the life giving solar arrays to power the instruments and electronics. \"We have global objectives and can do our science anywhere on the planet.\" Elysium Planitia is not too far from the landing sites of the Spirit and Curiosity rovers.

The new mission, called InSight, will attempt to determine whether Mars' core is liquid or solid, and why the Red Planet's crust does not appear to be composed of drifting tectonic plates like Earth's is. Such information could help scientists better understand how rocky planets form and evolve, researchers said. \"InSight will get to the 'core' of the nature of the interior and structure of Mars, well below the observations we've been able to make from orbit or the surface,\" John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. A low-cost Mars mission: InSight - short for Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport - is the latest of NASA's Discovery-class missions, and its cost will be capped at $425 million in 2010 dollars. The mission will be led by Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Insight is slated to launch in March 2016 and put a lander on Mars in September of that year to begin its two-year science mission. The lander will carry four instruments, which will determine Mars' rotation axis and measure the seismic waves and heat flowing through and from the planet's interior. The craft will also sport a robotic arm and two cameras, researchers said. Insight beat out two other finalists to become NASA's 12th Discovery-class mission. The other two contenders were Comet Hopper, which would have landed on a comet multiple times to study how the body changed on its trip around the sun, and the Titan Mare Explorer, or TiME. TiME would have dropped onto the methane-ethane seas of Saturn's huge moon Titan, providing the first direct exploration of an ocean beyond Earth. All three finalists offered great scientific potential, officials said. But InSight builds on technology used in NASA's Phoenix lander mission, which confirmed the presence of subsurface water ice near the Martian north pole in 2008. That heritage - along with key contributions on science instruments from the French and German space agencies - helped swing the decision InSight's way, convincing NASA that the mission could stay within its relatively low budget. \"One of the major factors for both Comet Hopper and for the Titan Mare Explorer, you know, were cost risks - cost and schedule risks,\" Grunsfeld told reporters today. \"The InSight mission had the highest probability - by enough margin that it distinguished itself - that it could actually be accomplished under the cost constraints that we have, and on the schedule,\" Grunsfeld added. \"I don't think I need to tell you that in the current fiscal environment that's really a very important element, all other things being equal, as they were.\" The selection of InSight may help reaffirm NASA's dedication to Mars exploration despite recent financial troubles. The White House's proposed 2013 federal budget cuts the agency's planetary science efforts by 20 percent, with much of the funding coming out of the Mars program. As a result, NASA dropped out of the European-led ExoMars mission - which aims to launch an orbiter and a rover to the Red Planet in 2016 and 2018, respectively - and has begun downscaling its Mars program. \"The exploration of Mars is a top priority for NASA, and the selection of InSight ensures we will continue to unlock the mysteries of the Red Planet and lay the groundwork for a future human mission there,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement. \"The recent successful landing of the Curiosity rover has galvanized public interest in space exploration, and today's announcement makes clear there are more exciting Mars missions to come,\" Bolden added.

Made by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR, HP3 will get below Mars' skin by literally pounding it into submission with a 14-inch (35-centimeter), hollowed-out, electromechanically-festooned stake called the Tractor Mole. \"The Tractor Mole has an internal hammer that rises and falls, moving the stake down in the soil and dragging a tether along behind it,\" said Sue Smrekar, deputy project scientist for InSight from JPL. \"We're essentially doing the same thing any Boy or Girl Scout would do on a campout, but we're putting our stake down on Mars.\" The German-built mole will descend up to 16 feet (five meters) below the surface, where its temperature sensors will record how much heat is coming from Mars' interior, which reveals the planet's thermal history. \"Getting well below the surface gets us away from the sun's influence and allows us to measure heat coming from the interior,\" said Smrekar. \"InSight is going take heartbeat and vital signs of the Red Planet for an entire Martian year, two Earth years. We are really going to have an opportunity to understand the processes that control the early planetary formation.\" InSight stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The mission is led by W. Bruce Banerdt of JPL. InSight's science team includes U.S. and international co-investigators from universities, industry and government agencies. Along with DLR, the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, or CNES, is also contributing an instrument to the two-year scientific mission. InSight builds on spacecraft technology used in NASA's highly successful Phoenix lander mission, which was launched to the Red Planet in 2007 and determined that water ice exists near the surface in the Martian polar regions.

Current budget paradigms dictate that the space agency think economically in its approach to future Mars exploration. For surface-based exploration, that means a realistic return to NASA's Discovery-class solar system exploration missions on budgets of $450 million or less. Thus, NASA has just announced that it has selected InSight, a new $425 million Mars surface mission for launch in 2016. Building on the space agency's Mars Phoenix Lander spacecraft technology, InSight will study the Red Planet's deep interior for clues to how its planetary structure actually evolved. It should also determine whether Mars has a liquid or solid core and why unlike earth, its crust lacks drifting tectonic plates. But then how about some good old-fashioned geyser hopping? Mars Geyser Hopper, a Discovery-class mission concept study that has largely gone unnoticed, is potentially a follow-on to the Phoenix Lander mission and would launch at earliest in 2018. The spacecraft would represent the first attempt to land at Mars' geographic South Pole and would offer the promise of some spectacular high-quality live- action video of carbon dioxide geysers spewing forth at the beginning of early spring. That's when the sun is still only a few degrees above the horizon and temperatures are typically 150 degrees below zero Celsius. Using automated detection equipment, the hopper would pick up the first signs of an erupting geyser which, in turn, would trigger high-speed particle motion detectors and high-resolution imagery. There would also be detailed chemical analysis of geyser fallout once it hit the Martian surface. It wouldn't be the first time NASA has played the hopping game; in 1967, the space agency's Surveyor VI spacecraft made an eight-ft. repositioning hop after landing on the lunar surface. But the Geyser Hopper mission would make at least two subsequent hops after landing. The first would enable the spacecraft to better study the geyser fields during southern polar summer. And the second would be to position itself to best wait out the harsh dark polar winter. There have been hundreds of geysers seen from Mars polar orbit already. But thousands of springtime geysers are thought to potentially stretch over an area of several hundred kilometers; crowding the polar landscape at a density of roughly one geyser for every 2 kilometers. \"Geysers on Mars are very different from those in Yellowstone National Park,\" said Geoffrey Landis, the study concept lead on the hopper mission at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. \"In winter, when there's no sunlight at the South Pole, the pole builds up a thick layer of carbon dioxide ice. When the sun finally rises in spring, it shines right through.\" Eccentricities in Mars' solar orbit cause the planet to make its closest approach to the sun during the southern hemisphere's summer; setting off extreme seasonal melting of Mars' southern polar cap. The surface underneath heats up, since the ice itself is almost translucent, says Landis. This heating causes ice at the pack's bottom to quickly turn to gas; creating pressure to spew forth as geysers at speeds of 160 km/hr. At peak season, there's a new geyser created almost daily and capable of pushing carbon dioxide gas, basaltic sand, and other debris to heights of hundreds of meters. Landis says that after the first hop of some 2 km, the lander would spend a few weeks characterizing its local ice-free summer environs. It would then do a second shorter 100-meter hop to a slightly higher elevation which would enable it to survey the landscape. During winter, the hopper would take continuous meteorological data and relay that data back to earth courtesy of a single Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator whose residual waste heat would also keep the spacecraft ice- free. Landis says the hopper should have enough fuel leftover for a third hop to fine-tune its last position. But the hops have to be done relatively early in the mission. As Landis notes, this form of hydrazine rocket propellant is very easy to store, but is nettlesome when outlasting a Martian winter. \"We can't sit on Mars for a long time and expect the spacecraft's pulsed hydrazine engines to keep working,\" said Landis. He points out that the hopper technology so useful for observing the south polar geysers could also help explore a large swath of Martian terrain as well as be used on a host of bodies in the outer solar system --- from rugged moons to dwarf planets.

The new mission, called InSight, will attempt to determine whether Mars' core is liquid or solid, and why the Red Planet's crust does not appear to be composed of drifting tectonic plates like Earth's is. Such information could help scientists better understand how rocky planets form and evolve, researchers said. \"InSight will get to the 'core' of the nature of the interior and structure of Mars, well below the observations we've been able to make from orbit or the surface,\" John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. A low-cost Mars mission: InSight - short for Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport - is the latest of NASA's Discovery-class missions, and its cost will be capped at $425 million in 2010 dollars. The mission will be led by Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Insight is slated to launch in March 2016 and put a lander on Mars in September of that year to begin its two-year science mission. The lander will carry four instruments, which will determine Mars' rotation axis and measure the seismic waves and heat flowing through and from the planet's interior. The craft will also sport a robotic arm and two cameras, researchers said. Insight beat out two other finalists to become NASA's 12th Discovery-class mission. The other two contenders were Comet Hopper, which would have landed on a comet multiple times to study how the body changed on its trip around the sun, and the Titan Mare Explorer, or TiME. TiME would have dropped onto the methane-ethane seas of Saturn's huge moon Titan, providing the first direct exploration of an ocean beyond Earth. All three finalists offered great scientific potential, officials said. But InSight builds on technology used in NASA's Phoenix lander mission, which confirmed the presence of subsurface water ice near the Martian north pole in 2008. That heritage - along with key contributions on science instruments from the French and German space agencies - helped swing the decision InSight's way, convincing NASA that the mission could stay within its relatively low budget. \"One of the major factors for both Comet Hopper and for the Titan Mare Explorer, you know, were cost risks - cost and schedule risks,\" Grunsfeld told reporters today. \"The InSight mission had the highest probability - by enough margin that it distinguished itself - that it could actually be accomplished under the cost constraints that we have, and on the schedule,\" Grunsfeld added. \"I don't think I need to tell you that in the current fiscal environment that's really a very important element, all other things being equal, as they were.\" The selection of InSight may help reaffirm NASA's dedication to Mars exploration despite recent financial troubles. The White House's proposed 2013 federal budget cuts the agency's planetary science efforts by 20 percent, with much of the funding coming out of the Mars program. As a result, NASA dropped out of the European-led ExoMars mission - which aims to launch an orbiter and a rover to the Red Planet in 2016 and 2018, respectively - and has begun downscaling its Mars program. \"The exploration of Mars is a top priority for NASA, and the selection of InSight ensures we will continue to unlock the mysteries of the Red Planet and lay the groundwork for a future human mission there,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement. \"The recent successful landing of the Curiosity rover has galvanized public interest in space exploration, and today's announcement makes clear there are more exciting Mars missions to come,\" Bolden added.

Made by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR, HP3 will get below Mars' skin by literally pounding it into submission with a 14-inch (35-centimeter), hollowed-out, electromechanically-festooned stake called the Tractor Mole. \"The Tractor Mole has an internal hammer that rises and falls, moving the stake down in the soil and dragging a tether along behind it,\" said Sue Smrekar, deputy project scientist for InSight from JPL. \"We're essentially doing the same thing any Boy or Girl Scout would do on a campout, but we're putting our stake down on Mars.\" The German-built mole will descend up to 16 feet (five meters) below the surface, where its temperature sensors will record how much heat is coming from Mars' interior, which reveals the planet's thermal history. \"Getting well below the surface gets us away from the sun's influence and allows us to measure heat coming from the interior,\" said Smrekar. \"InSight is going take heartbeat and vital signs of the Red Planet for an entire Martian year, two Earth years.

Current budget paradigms dictate that the space agency think economically in its approach to future Mars exploration. For surface-based exploration, that means a realistic return to NASA's Discovery-class solar system exploration missions on budgets of $450 million or less. Thus, NASA has just announced that it has selected InSight, a new $425 million Mars surface mission for launch in 2016. Building on the space agency's Mars Phoenix Lander spacecraft technology, InSight will study the Red Planet's deep interior for clues to how its planetary structure actually evolved. It should also determine whether Mars has a liquid or solid core and why unlike earth, its crust lacks drifting tectonic plates. But then how about some good old-fashioned geyser hopping? Mars Geyser Hopper, a Discovery-class mission concept study that has largely gone unnoticed, is potentially a follow-on to the Phoenix Lander mission and would launch at earliest in 2018. The spacecraft would represent the first attempt to land at Mars' geographic South Pole and would offer the promise of some spectacular high-quality live- action video of carbon dioxide geysers spewing forth at the beginning of early spring. That's when the sun is still only a few degrees above the horizon and temperatures are typically 150 degrees below zero Celsius. Using automated detection equipment, the hopper would pick up the first signs of an erupting geyser which, in turn, would trigger high-speed particle motion detectors and high-resolution imagery. There would also be detailed chemical analysis of geyser fallout once it hit the Martian surface. It wouldn't be the first time NASA has played the hopping game; in 1967, the space agency's Surveyor VI spacecraft made an eight-ft. repositioning hop after landing on the lunar surface. But the Geyser Hopper mission would make at least two subsequent hops after landing. The first would enable the spacecraft to better study the geyser fields during southern polar summer. And the second would be to position itself to best wait out the harsh dark polar winter. There have been hundreds of geysers seen from Mars polar orbit already. But thousands of springtime geysers are thought to potentially stretch over an area of several hundred kilometers; crowding the polar landscape at a density of roughly one geyser for every 2 kilometers. \"Geysers on Mars are very different from those in Yellowstone National Park,\" said Geoffrey Landis, the study concept lead on the hopper mission at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. \"In winter, when there's no sunlight at the South Pole, the pole builds up a thick layer of carbon dioxide ice. When the sun finally rises in spring, it shines right through.\" Eccentricities in Mars' solar orbit cause the planet to make its closest approach to the sun during the southern hemisphere's summer; setting off extreme seasonal melting of Mars' southern polar cap. The surface underneath heats up, since the ice itself is almost translucent, says Landis. This heating causes ice at the pack's bottom to quickly turn to gas; creating pressure to spew forth as geysers at speeds of 160 km/hr. At peak season, there's a new geyser created almost daily and capable of pushing carbon dioxide gas, basaltic sand, and other debris to heights of hundreds of meters. Landis says that after the first hop of some 2 km, the lander would spend a few weeks characterizing its local ice-free summer environs. It would then do a second shorter 100-meter hop to a slightly higher elevation which would enable it to survey the landscape. During winter, the hopper would take continuous meteorological data and relay that data back to earth courtesy of a single Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator whose residual waste heat would also keep the spacecraft ice- free. Landis says the hopper should have enough fuel leftover for a third hop to fine-tune its last position. But the hops have to be done relatively early in the mission. As Landis notes, this form of hydrazine rocket propellant is very easy to store, but is nettlesome when outlasting a Martian winter. \"We can't sit on Mars for a long time and expect the spacecraft's pulsed hydrazine engines to keep working,\" said Landis. He points out that the hopper technology so useful for observing the south polar geysers could also help explore a large swath of Martian terrain as well as be used on a host of bodies in the outer solar system --- from rugged moons to dwarf planets. Landis isn't averse to thinking creatively about Mars, since he spends much of his time outside of work writing prize-winning science fiction; \"Mars Crossing\" probably being his best known. \"If we are eventually going to get a sample back and send humans to Mars,\" said Landis, \"we not only have to land but take off again.

The agency says InSight's selection was based on its low cost-currently capped at $425 million excluding launch costs-and relatively low risk. It has, in short, fewer known unknowns than the other proposals. But while InSight costs less than half a billion itself, the total value of the mission by the time it launches will be closer to $2 billion. How can NASA get that much zoom for so few bucks? By harnessing technologies developed for and proven on previous missions. The research, development, and testing that has gone into every previous lander take a lot of guesswork out of this mission, helping it fly for cheap.

When it comes to the vital task of getting landers safely to the surface, NASA has been reusing the same method for decades. It has its roots way back in the Apollo days. A mosaic of Mars' Chryse Planitia created from images taken by Viking 1. NASA first demonstrated how to make effective Mars landings with the Viking missions, a pair of twin landers that reached the surface in 1976. Each was sent to Mars with an elaborate, three-stage system for slowing the craft down for a gentle landing. The first stage was an aeroshell, a case designed to create enough drag to slow the lander's descent without building up too much heat from atmospheric friction that it melted the instruments inside. For the second braking mechanism, NASA took advantage of the fact that Mars, unlike the Moon, has an atmosphere-they used a parachute. And the final descent was made with the help of retrorockets, which fire opposite a lander's direction of travel. They slowed the landers to a gentle touchdown, at which point a sensor in the leg shut the rockets down. This approach seemed sound, but it required a lot of real-world testing to make sure it would work. One particular challenge was that Mars' thin atmosphere meant that the lander would still be falling faster than the speed of sound when the chute needs to deploy. To test parachutes in a hypersonic, low-atmosphere environment, engineers put plentiful Apollo-era funding to good use. They ran a series of tests that sent a payload into Earth's thin upper atmosphere with a balloon, accelerated it past the speed of sound, then deployed the parachute. It was an expensive test NASA hasn't repeated since 1968, but it worked and did offer a good stand in for the Martian environment. The whole system worked. Both Vikings landed safely, eventually exceeding their expected lifetime on the surface. NASA ported much of what worked in the Viking missions right over to the Mars Polar Lander, launched in 1999. Unfortunately, this mission failed when the leg sensor registered a false signal during the descent, causing the retros to shut down early. The Polar lander slammed into the surface at about 50 miles per hour, 100 times faster than it was designed to land.

The recycled craft used the Viking and Polar landing method, modified to include the lessons learned from the crash. The fixes worked: Phoenix landed safe and sound, working for 155 sols before falling silent. This is the heritage behind InSight's landing: $1 billion spent developing the Viking mission, $457 million for Phoenix, $120 million for the Polar lander. All the mission details aren't out yet, but if InSight's \"virtually identical\" landing means the same aeroshell, parachute, radar, retros, and landing sensors, it's unlikely NASA will have to spend significant money extensively testing all these systems.

Scientists expect the answers to help their understanding of how planets like Earth and Mars coalesced and evolved after the birth of the solar system, according to Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the InSight lander due to launch in March 2016. \"The InSight mission is a geophysical mission to Mars,\" Banerdt said. \"It's going to go to Mars and take its vital signs. It's going to take its heartbeat - the seismic activity of the planet. It's going to take its temperature by measuring the thermal gradient of its surface, which tells us how much heat is coming out. And it's going to measure its reflexes by looking at how its rotation wobbles with the tidal effects of the sun.\" Based on a proven lander design successfully demonstrated by NASA's Phoenix mission in 2008, the InSight spacecraft will make a rocket-assisted touchdown in a region named Elysium Planitia, a broad equatorial plain dotted with extinct volcanoes. \"It's very flat,\" Banerdt said. \"There are lava flows nearby, and we have already picked out landing ellipses around the flow.\" Banerdt is a researcher based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Teams identified 16 potential landing zones around the western side of Elysium Planitia. All of the ellipse-shaped landing site candidates meet the lander's engineering constraints, which stipulate an area of sufficiently low altitude to allow the spacecraft to safely make a parachute- and rocket-assisted descent. InSight also needs a flat landing area free of large rocks with penetrable soil to a depth of at least 5 meters, or about 15 feet. The mission's two main instruments, a seismometer and drilling heat probe, require a site with soft rock-free soil. According to a presentation by Matt Golombek, a geologist at JPL, the list of 16 candidate landing sites will be whittled down to and a half-dozen locations by the end of this year. Officials will select two or three finalists by the end of 2014, ultimately leading to a final decision on InSight's destination by the end of 2015. A high-resolution camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will take detailed photos of each landing ellipse throughout the process, looking for hazards such as steep slopes and boulder fields. Unlike NASA's Curiosity rover, which targeted a science-rich landing site on the flank of a three-mile-high mountain, InSight's landing site will be selected based solely on engineering and safety considerations. The three-legged InSight lander, built by Lockheed Martin Corp., will set down on Mars in September 2016, starting a surface mission expected to last at least two years. InSight was selected by NASA in August as the next project in the agency's Discovery program, which fields planetary exploration missions on tightly-controlled budgets. InSight's cost to NASA is capped at $425 million, excluding launch vehicle costs. Engineers know the capabilities and limits of the Phoenix lander system, which was originally designed for a mission that was supposed to launch in 2001. The 2001 lander, named Surveyor, was canceled in the wake of the back-to-back failures of NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander missions in 1998. The understanding will keep InSight's costs under control and simplify the mission's development, Banerdt said. The stationary lander design, with its roots in the late 1990s, showed exemplary performance during the Phoenix mission, which launched in 2007 and touched down on the red planet's northern polar plains in May 2008. The biggest change from the Phoenix spacecraft to InSight is a suite of new instruments. Instead of analyzing soil and scouring the surface for signs of ice, as Phoenix did, the InSight mission will deploy a seismometer to make the first direct measurements of Mars quakes. The lander will also employ a hammering drill to burrow up to 15 feet underground, taking temperature readings to measure heat changes at different layers immediately beneath the Martian surface. The French space agency, CNES, is providing InSight's $42 million seismometer. Germany is funding the lander's underground heat probe. Scientists will also analyze radio signals bouncing between Earth and the InSight spacecraft, detecting tiny wobbles in the red planet's rotation, revealing properties of the Martian core. All the investigations have the objective of telling scientists about the interior of Mars. Banerdt said researchers can take that information a step further, comparing InSight's findings with what is known about Earth and the moon to paint a clearer picture of how the solar system's rocky planets formed and cooled. \"Mars is kind of the Goldilocks planet,\" Banerdt said. \"It's not too big, it's not too small, it's just right. If it was too big, it would have retained a lot of activity and erased all the evidence that we're looking for. If it was too small, it never would have undergone the same processes that formed the Earth.\" Among others, InSight will address questions such as: Does Mars have a liquid or solid core? What is the size of the Martian core? How thick is the Martian crust? How common are Mars quakes? What is the composition of the Martian mantle? How often do meteorites strike the Martian surface? Up to now, Banerdt said, scientists could only guess answers to such questions. \"We are missing cold, hard data, and this is what this mission will provide,\" said Suzanne Smrekar, InSight's deputy principal investigator based at JPL. \"We've done a lot of exploring on the surface of Mars, and we have missions coming up to study the atmosphere,\" Banerdt said, referring to a pair of upcoming spacecraft - NASA's MAVEN mission and Europe's Trace Gas Orbiter - focused on the Martian atmosphere. MAVEN will launch in November, and the Trace Gas Orbiter is scheduled to launch in January 2016, two months before InSight. \"But when it comes to what's below the surface of Mars, we don't understand as much,\" Banerdt said. \"We are plugging that last big hole in the basic understanding of Mars.\" Don't expect InSight to produce color panoramic images like the Curiosity rover. The lander will carry a set of black-and-white cameras, utilizing spares left over from NASA's rover missions to save money, according to Banerdt. The cameras will monitor movements of the lander's robotic arm as it picks up the seismometer and drill instruments from the spacecraft's payload deck and places the devices on the Martian surface.", "url": "https://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1303/30insight/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "InSight mission to find what lies beneath Martian surface", "date": "2013-03-30", "content": "NASA's next Mars lander will launch in 2016 to take the red planet's pulse and temperature, listening for tremors, measuring underground heat and monitoring the wobble in its rotation to answer fundamental questions about what lies beneath the desert world's rust-colored surface.

And it's going to measure its reflexes by looking at how its rotation wobbles with the tidal effects of the sun.\" Based on a proven lander design successfully demonstrated by NASA's Phoenix mission in 2008, the InSight spacecraft will make a rocket-assisted touchdown in a region named Elysium Planitia, a broad equatorial plain dotted with extinct volcanoes. \"It's very flat,\" Banerdt said. \"There are lava flows nearby, and we have already picked out landing ellipses around the flow.\" Banerdt is a researcher based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Teams identified 16 potential landing zones around the western side of Elysium Planitia. All of the ellipse-shaped landing site candidates meet the lander's engineering constraints, which stipulate an area of sufficiently low altitude to allow the spacecraft to safely make a parachute- and rocket-assisted descent. InSight also needs a flat landing area free of large rocks with penetrable soil to a depth of at least 5 meters, or about 15 feet. The mission's two main instruments, a seismometer and drilling heat probe, require a site with soft rock-free soil. According to a presentation by Matt Golombek, a geologist at JPL, the list of 16 candidate landing sites will be whittled down to and a half-dozen locations by the end of this year. Officials will select two or three finalists by the end of 2014, ultimately leading to a final decision on InSight's destination by the end of 2015. A high-resolution camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will take detailed photos of each landing ellipse throughout the process, looking for hazards such as steep slopes and boulder fields. Unlike NASA's Curiosity rover, which targeted a science-rich landing site on the flank of a three-mile-high mountain, InSight's landing site will be selected based solely on engineering and safety considerations. The three-legged InSight lander, built by Lockheed Martin Corp., will set down on Mars in September 2016, starting a surface mission expected to last at least two years. InSight was selected by NASA in August as the next project in the agency's Discovery program, which fields planetary exploration missions on tightly-controlled budgets. InSight's cost to NASA is capped at $425 million, excluding launch vehicle costs. Engineers know the capabilities and limits of the Phoenix lander system, which was originally designed for a mission that was supposed to launch in 2001. The 2001 lander, named Surveyor, was canceled in the wake of the back-to-back failures of NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander missions in 1998. The understanding will keep InSight's costs under control and simplify the mission's development, Banerdt said. The stationary lander design, with its roots in the late 1990s, showed exemplary performance during the Phoenix mission, which launched in 2007 and touched down on the red planet's northern polar plains in May 2008. The biggest change from the Phoenix spacecraft to InSight is a suite of new instruments. Instead of analyzing soil and scouring the surface for signs of ice, as Phoenix did, the InSight mission will deploy a seismometer to make the first direct measurements of Mars quakes. The lander will also employ a hammering drill to burrow up to 15 feet underground, taking temperature readings to measure heat changes at different layers immediately beneath the Martian surface. The French space agency, CNES, is providing InSight's $42 million seismometer. Germany is funding the lander's underground heat probe. Scientists will also analyze radio signals bouncing between Earth and the InSight spacecraft, detecting tiny wobbles in the red planet's rotation, revealing properties of the Martian core. All the investigations have the objective of telling scientists about the interior of Mars. Banerdt said researchers can take that information a step further, comparing InSight's findings with what is known about Earth and the moon to paint a clearer picture of how the solar system's rocky planets formed and cooled. \"Mars is kind of the Goldilocks planet,\" Banerdt said. \"It's not too big, it's not too small, it's just right. If it was too big, it would have retained a lot of activity and erased all the evidence that we're looking for. If it was too small, it never would have undergone the same processes that formed the Earth.\" Among others, InSight will address questions such as: Does Mars have a liquid or solid core? What is the size of the Martian core? How thick is the Martian crust? How common are Mars quakes? What is the composition of the Martian mantle? How often do meteorites strike the Martian surface? Up to now, Banerdt said, scientists could only guess answers to such questions. \"We are missing cold, hard data, and this is what this mission will provide,\" said Suzanne Smrekar, InSight's deputy principal investigator based at JPL. \"We've done a lot of exploring on the surface of Mars, and we have missions coming up to study the atmosphere,\" Banerdt said, referring to a pair of upcoming spacecraft - NASA's MAVEN mission and Europe's Trace Gas Orbiter - focused on the Martian atmosphere. MAVEN will launch in November, and the Trace Gas Orbiter is scheduled to launch in January 2016, two months before InSight. \"But when it comes to what's below the surface of Mars, we don't understand as much,\" Banerdt said. \"We are plugging that last big hole in the basic understanding of Mars.\" Don't expect InSight to produce color panoramic images like the Curiosity rover. The lander will carry a set of black-and-white cameras, utilizing spares left over from NASA's rover missions to save money, according to Banerdt.

InSight is equipped with a heat-flow probe, which it will hammer into the surface of Mars to a depth of between 9 and 15 feet. But the probe can only hammer into Martian dirt and broken-up surface material, not hard bedrock. InSight also carries a seismometer and radio to conduct experiments.

The only other two areas of Mars meeting the requirements of being near the equator at low elevation, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris, were said to be too rocky and windy. Valles Marineris also lacks any swath of flat ground large enough for a safe landing. Another requirement is that InSight needs to land on ground that allows the lander to deploy a heat-flow probe that will hammer itself several meters into the Martian surface to monitor heat coming from the planet's interior. In order to ensure there no hard rocks that might block the probe, scientists studied Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter images of large rocks near Martian craters formed by asteroid impacts.

NASA says the InSight will have a 99 percent chance of landing within the chosen ellipse. Elysium Planitia meets the requirements for InSight because it is close to the equator, so that the spacecraft's solar array will be able to provide power all year. Also the areas are all low enough to allow the landing craft to decelerate more completely before landing. The only other two areas of Mars meeting the requirements of being near the equator at low elevation, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris, were said to be too rocky and windy. Valles Marineris also lacks any swath of flat ground large enough for a safe landing. Another requirement is that InSight needs to land on ground that allows the lander to deploy a heat-flow probe that will hammer itself several meters into the Martian surface to monitor heat coming from the planet's interior. In order to ensure there no hard rocks that might block the probe, scientists studied Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter images of large rocks near Martian craters formed by asteroid impacts. Impacts excavate rocks from the subsurface, so by looking in the area surrounding craters, the scientists can tell if the subsurface would have probe-blocking rocks lurking beneath the soil surface.

The location of the landing site for InSight is indicated on this near-global topographic map of Mars, which also indicates landing sites of current and past NASA missions to the surface of Mars. The location of Elysium Planitia close to the Martian equator meets an engineering requirement for the stationary InSight lander to receive adequate solar irradiation year-round on its photovoltaic array.

NASA's Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission will pierce beneath the Martian surface to study its interior. The mission will investigate how Earth-like planets formed and developed their layered inner structure of core, mantle and crust, and will collect information about those interior zones using instruments never before used on Mars. InSight will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, on the central California coast near Lompoc, in March 2016. This will be the first interplanetary mission ever to launch from California. The mission will help inform the agency's goal of sending a human mission to Mars in the 2030s. InSight team leaders presented mission-design results last week to a NASA review board, which approved advancing to the next stage of preparation. \"Our partners across the globe have made significant progress in getting to this point and are fully prepared to deliver their hardware to system integration starting this November, which is the next major milestone for the project,\" said Tom Hoffman, InSight Project Manager of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California. \"We now move from doing the design and analysis to building and testing the hardware and software that will get us to Mars and collect the science that we need to achieve mission success.\" To investigate the planet's interior, the stationary lander will carry a robotic arm that will deploy surface and burrowing instruments contributed by France and Germany. The national space agencies of France and Germany -- Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) -- are partnering with NASA by providing InSight's two main science instruments. The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) will be built by CNES in partnership with DLR and the space agencies of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It will measure waves of ground motion carried through the interior of the planet, from \"marsquakes\" and meteor impacts. The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, from DLR, will measure heat coming toward the surface from the planet's interior. \"Mars actually offers an advantage over Earth itself for understanding how habitable planetary surfaces can form,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight Principal Investigator from JPL. \"Both planets underwent the same early processes. But Mars, being smaller, cooled faster and became less active while Earth kept churning. So Mars better preserves the evidence about the early stages of rocky planets' development.\" The three-legged lander will go to a site near the Martian equator and provide information for a planned mission length of 720 days -- about two years. InSight adapts a design from the successful NASA Phoenix Mars Lander, which examined ice and soil on far-northern Mars in 2008. \"We will incorporate many features from our Phoenix spacecraft into InSight, but the differences between the missions require some differences in the InSight spacecraft,\" said InSight Program Manager Stu Spath of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Denver, Colorado. \"For example, the InSight mission duration is 630 days longer than Phoenix, which means the lander will have to endure a wider range of environmental conditions on the surface.\" Guided by images of the surroundings taken by the lander, InSight's robotic arm will place the seismometer on the surface and then place a protective covering over it to minimize effects of wind and temperature on the sensitive instrument. The arm will also put the heat-flow probe in position to hammer itself into the ground to a depth of 3 to 5 yards (2.7 to 4 1/2 meters). Another experiment will use the radio link between InSight and NASA's Deep Space Network antennas on Earth to precisely measure a wobble in Mars' rotation that could reveal whether Mars has a molten or solid core. Wind and temperature sensors from Spain's Centro de Astrobiologia and a pressure sensor will monitor weather at the landing site, and a magnetometer will measure magnetic disturbances caused by the Martian ionosphere. InSight's international science team is made up of researchers from Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

InSight is an international science mission and a near duplicate of the Phoenix spacecraft, said Bruce Banerdt, InSight Principal Investigator of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif. However, the probe will incorporate some significant modifications to modernize the design based on advances developed for NASA's new MAVEN Mars orbiter which only recently achieved orbit in September 2014. \"The InSight mission is a mix of tried-and-true and new-and-exciting.

For example, the planned mission duration is 720 days-about two years at the Red Planet's sunny equator versus 90 days for Phoenix in the bitterly cold Martian arctic region. Furthermore, InSight is one of NASA's Discovery class missions, like the Dawn Asteroid Orbiter for example. It also includes very significant international science participation. InSight's purpose is to answer one of science's most fundamental questions: What were the processes that shaped how the planets were created four billion years ago, especially the terrestrial class planets like Earth? InSight will mine the deepest hole yet into Mars with a self-hammering \"mole,\" to a depth of 3 to 5 meters, and unveil the nature of the mysterious deep interior and central core of the Red Planet.

InSight's construction is on track for its scheduled departure from Earth to the Red Planet in March 2016. InSight, which stands for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is a stationary lander. The vehicle will join NASA's current pair of surface explorers, Curiosity and Opportunity, which in contrast are mobile rovers. It will touch down near the Martian equator in late 2016 near Curiosity. The three-legged InSight lander will conduct an unprecedented mission to investigate the Red Planet's deep interior, elucidating the nature and evolution of the Martian core, measuring heat flow, and sensing for \"Marsquakes.\" The $425-million solar-powered lander, its aeroshell, and cruise stage are all being fabricated by prime contractor Lockheed Martin in a Denver, Colo., clean room. \"Reaching this stage that we call ATLO is a critical milestone,\" said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"This is a very satisfying point of the mission as we transition from many teams working on their individual elements to integrating these elements into a functioning system. The subsystems are coming from all over the globe, and the ATLO team works to integrate them into the flight vehicle. We will then move rapidly to rigorous testing when the spacecraft has been assembled, and then to the launch preparations.\" The lander will really take shape over the next six months, as Lockheed Martin technicians add the probes assorted subsystems including avionics, power, telecomm, mechanisms, thermal systems, and navigation systems. They installed the propulsion system onto the framework earlier this year. The cruise stage assembly work includes adding communications systems, solar power arrays, and thrusters to navigate the spacecraft on the months'-long interplanetary journey to the Red Planet. Liftoff of InSight atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is scheduled for March 2016 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. This marks NASA's first-ever interplanetary mission to launch from California. The vehicle design is based on the proven platform of NASA's three-legged Phoenix Mars probe-also built by Lockheed Martin-which successfully touched down on the planet's frigid northern polar regions in 2008 in search of potential habitats for life. InSight is an international science mission and a near duplicate of the Phoenix spacecraft, said Bruce Banerdt, InSight Principal Investigator of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif. However, the probe will incorporate some significant modifications to modernize the design based on advances developed for NASA's new MAVEN Mars orbiter which only recently achieved orbit in September 2014. \"The InSight mission is a mix of tried-and-true and new-and-exciting. The spacecraft has a lot of heritage from Phoenix and even back to the Viking landers, but the science has never been done before at Mars,\" said Stu Spath, InSight program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"Physically, InSight looks very much like the Phoenix lander we built, but most of the electronic components are similar to what is currently flying on the MAVEN spacecraft.\" The life span, science goals, and instrument suite on InSight are also completely different from Phoenix. For example, the planned mission duration is 720 days-about two years at the Red Planet's sunny equator versus 90 days for Phoenix in the bitterly cold Martian arctic region. Furthermore, InSight is one of NASA's Discovery class missions, like the Dawn Asteroid Orbiter for example. It also includes very significant international science participation. InSight's purpose is to answer one of science's most fundamental questions: What were the processes that shaped how the planets were created four billion years ago, especially the terrestrial class planets like Earth? InSight will mine the deepest hole yet into Mars with a self-hammering \"mole,\" to a depth of 3 to 5 meters, and unveil the nature of the mysterious deep interior and central core of the Red Planet. Therefore, InSight will penetrate far deeper than Phoenix ever could in order to investigate how Earth-like planets formed and developed their layered inner structure of core, mantle, and crust by deploying never-before-used instruments onto the Martian surface to collect information about those interior zones. InSight also possesses a robotic arm like Phoenix that's critical to achieving its science goals. \"The robotic arm is similar (but not identical) to the Phoenix arm,\" Banerdt explained. In addition to NASA, it is funded by several European national space agency's and countries. Germany and France are providing InSight's two main science instruments: HP3 and SEIS through the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR, or German Space Agency) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) will be built by CNES in partnership with DLR and the space agency's of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It will measure waves of ground motion carried through the interior of the planet, from \"marsquakes\" and meteor impacts. The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), from DLR, will measure heat coming toward the surface from the planet's interior. The robotic arm will deploy the pair of surface and burrowing instruments contributed by France and Germany to suitable locations based on images taken by the lander's pair of cameras. InSight's robotic arm will place the seismometer on the surface and then place a protective covering over it to minimize effects of wind and temperature on the sensitive instrument. The arm will also put the heat-flow probe in position to hammer itself into the ground to a depth of 3 to 5 yards, or meters, according to a NASA description. The third experiment, named RISE (Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment), is to be provided by JPL and will use the spacecraft communication system and a radio link to NASA's Deep Space Network antennas on Earth to precisely measure a wobble in Mars' planetary rotation that could reveal whether Mars has a molten or solid core, and elucidate clues to its interior structure and composition.

InSight is NASA's next mission to Mars and will be the first mission devoted to understanding the interior structure of the planet. InSight will endure the extreme vibration and noise of launch, a long journey through the vacuum and cold of deep space and the gauntlet of entry through the Martian atmosphere before beginning operations on the surface. Because of the extreme environments the spacecraft will encounter during its mission, the lander will undergo a variety of rigorous tests that will ensure it can survive the journey. During the environmental testing phase, the lander will be exposed to extreme temperatures, vacuum and a litany of other tests through the end of the year. The first of these tests will be a thermal vacuum test in the spacecraft's \"cruise\" configuration used during its seven-month journey to Mars. InSight will then be subjected to a barrage of additional tests, including reverberant acoustic, separation and deployment shock, and electromagnetic interference and compatibility testing. The testing phase concludes with a second thermal vacuum test where the spacecraft is exposed to the temperatures and atmospheric pressures it will experience as it operates on the surface of Mars. \"The assembly of InSight went very well, and now it's time to see how it performs,\" said Stu Spath, InSight program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"The environmental testing regimen is designed to wring out any issues with the spacecraft so we can resolve them while it's here on Earth. This phase takes nearly as long as assembly, but we want to make sure we deliver a vehicle to NASA that will perform as expected in extreme environments.\" Scheduled to launch in March 2016 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, InSight is a robotic exploration mission that will record measurements of the interior of the Red Planet, giving scientists unprecedented detail into the evolution of Mars and other terrestrial planets. The InSight mission will address one of the most fundamental issues of planetary and solar system science; understanding the processes that shaped the rocky planets of the inner solar system (including Earth) more than four billion years ago. \"It's great to see the spacecraft put together in its launch configuration,\" said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). \"Many teams from across the globe have worked long hours to get their elements of the system delivered for these tests.

InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) is a NASA Discovery Program mission that will send a lander to the Red Planet, which will delve deeper into the planet's surface than any other spacecraft. Previous missions to Mars have investigated the surface history of the planet by examining features like canyons, volcanoes, rocks and soil, but no one has attempted to investigate the planet's earliest evolution - its building blocks - which can only be found by looking far below the surface. The InSight mission will seek to understand the evolutionary formation of rocky planets, including Earth, by investigating the interior structure and processes of Mars. The mission will also investigate the dynamics of Martian tectonic activity and meteorite impacts, which could offer clues about such phenomena on Earth. The InSight lander is about the size of a car and will be equipped with science instruments that will conduct the first 'check-up' of Mars in more than 4.5 billion years. The science payload is comprised of two instruments: the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) and the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3). In addition, the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE) will use the spacecraft communication system to provide precise measurements of planetary rotation. The current testing will help ensure the InSight can operate in and survive deep space travel and the harsh conditions of the Martian surface. The spacecraft will lift off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and land on Mars about six months later. The technical capabilities and knowledge gained from the InSight, and other Mars missions, are crucial to NASA's journey to Mars, which includes sending astronauts to the Red Planet in the 2030s. \"Today, our robotic scientific explorers are paving the way, making great progress on the journey to Mars. Together, humans and robotics will pioneer Mars and the Solar System,\" said Dr Jim Green of NASA's Planetary Science Division at the agency's headquarters in Washington. During the environmental testing phase at Lockheed Martin's Space Systems facility near Denver, the lander will be exposed to extreme temperatures, vacuum conditions of nearly zero air pressure simulating interplanetary space, and a battery of other tests over the next seven months. The first will be a thermal vacuum test in the spacecraft's 'cruise' configuration, which will be used during its seven-month journey to Mars. Other tests include vibrations simulating launch and checking for electronic interference between different parts of the spacecraft.

NASA plans to launch InSight on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 401 booster from Vandenberg Air Force Base's Space Launch Complex 3 located in California sometime in mid-March of next year. Lockheed Martin is no stranger to missions to Mars, having been involved with every mission to the Red Planet for the past four decades. This fact was one that one official at LMCO highlighted when asked about the next NASA spacecraft planned to conduct a touchdown in the red Martian dust. \"The InSight mission is a NASA Discovery mission and is similar in design to the _Phoenix_ Mars lander use in 2008 to study ground ice near the north pole of Mars. The reuse of this technology, developed and built by Lockheed Martin, provided a low-risk path to Mars without the added cost of designing and testing a new system from scratch,\" Stu Spath, InSight program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, told SpaceFlight Insider. \"Even though InSight is based on the successful _Phoenix_ Mars lander, its computers and avionics are the latest generation drawing from MAVEN, the most recent mission to Mars.\" At present, InSight is undergoing environmental testing at LMCO's Space Systems facilities near Denver. \"The assembly of InSight went very well, and now it's time to see how it performs,\" Spath said. \"The environmental testing regimen is designed to wring out any issues with the spacecraft so we can resolve them while it's here on Earth. This phase takes nearly as long as assembly, but we want to make sure we deliver a vehicle to NASA that will perform as expected in extreme environments.\" All missions that are launched must endure the intense vibration, acoustic stresses and an array of other harsh conditions that are required for them to reach their various destinations. Even after InSight reaches orbit, its trials will not end. While the shaking and pressures caused by launch might have ceased, it must then survive the extreme cold and vacuum that is space. The battery of tests the lander is now undergoing will help to look for any issues that can then be addressed prior to flight. In order to determine how the lander handles the stresses of launch, cruise, landing, and the extreme Martian environment, it will be exposed to various tests: reverberant acoustic, thermal vacuum test, separation and deployment shock, internal electromagnetic interference and compatibility testing, as well as a second thermal vacuum test. The second thermal vacuum test is important in terms of the most critical time for the spacecraft - its time on the surface of the hostile alien world. This test will subject InSight to the types of temperatures and atmospheric pressures it will experience as it operates on the surface of Mars. When LMCO was asked about what the next steps for NASA's InSight mission would be, Spath provided some details about what the lander will encounter on the road to launch to SpaceFlight Insider. \"InSight will now move through its environmental testing phase. The first of these tests will be a thermal vacuum test in the spacecraft's 'cruise' configuration used during its seven-month journey to Mars. Environmental testing will run through the end of the year. Following that, we will ship the spacecraft in early 2016 to Vandenberg Air Force Base for launch preparations,\" Spath said. The InSight lander, safely encapsulated during its long voyage to Mars, will work to provide a better understanding of the dynamics of the Martian interior. The spacecraft will land on the surface of Mars in September 2016 and complete its primary mission in September 2018. \"It's great to see the spacecraft put together in its launch configuration,\" said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"Many teams from across the globe have worked long hours to get their elements of the system delivered for these tests.

The technical capabilities and knowledge gained from Insight, and other Mars missions, are crucial to NASA's journey to Mars, which includes sending astronauts to the Red Planet in the 2030s, the US space agency said. \"Today, our robotic scientific explorers are paving the way, making great progress on the journey to Mars,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division at the agency's headquarters here. Together, humans and robotics will pioneer Mars and the solar system,\" said Green. During the environmental testing phase at Lockheed Martin's Space Systems facility near Denver, the lander will be exposed to extreme temperatures, vacuum conditions of nearly zero air pressure simulating interplanetary space, and a battery of other tests over the next seven months. The first will be a thermal vacuum test in the spacecraft's \"cruise\" configuration, which will be used during its seven-month journey to Mars. In the cruise configuration, the lander is stowed inside an aeroshell capsule and the spacecraft's cruise stage - for power, communications, course corrections and other functions on the way to Mars - is fastened to the capsule. \"The assembly of InSight went very well and now it's time to see how it performs,\" said Stu Spath, InSight programme manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver. \"The environmental testing regimen is designed to wring out any issues with the spacecraft so we can resolve them while it's here on Earth. This phase takes nearly as long as assembly, but we want to make sure we deliver a vehicle to NASA that will perform as expected in extreme environments,\" said Spath. Other tests include vibrations simulating launch and checking for electronic interference between different parts of the spacecraft. The testing phase concludes with a second thermal vacuum test in which the spacecraft is exposed to the temperatures and atmospheric pressures it will experience as it operates on the Martian surface.

The craft has finished its construction phase by Lockheed Martin and will now undergo required checks to ensure that the mission successfully joins the other NASA craft above and on the surface of the Red Planet. NASA plans to launch InSight on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 401 booster from Vandenberg Air Force Base's Space Launch Complex 3 located in California sometime in mid-March of next year. Lockheed Martin is no stranger to missions to Mars, having been involved with every mission to the Red Planet for the past four decades. This fact was one that one official at LMCO highlighted when asked about the next NASA spacecraft planned to conduct a touchdown in the red Martian dust. \"The InSight mission is a NASA Discovery mission and is similar in design to the _Phoenix_ Mars lander use in 2008 to study ground ice near the north pole of Mars. The reuse of this technology, developed and built by Lockheed Martin, provided a low-risk path to Mars without the added cost of designing and testing a new system from scratch,\" Stu Spath, InSight program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, told SpaceFlight Insider. \"Even though InSight is based on the successful _Phoenix_ Mars lander, its computers and avionics are the latest generation drawing from MAVEN, the most recent mission to Mars.\" At present, InSight is undergoing environmental testing at LMCO's Space Systems facilities near Denver. \"The assembly of InSight went very well, and now it's time to see how it performs,\" Spath said. \"The environmental testing regimen is designed to wring out any issues with the spacecraft so we can resolve them while it's here on Earth. This phase takes nearly as long as assembly, but we want to make sure we deliver a vehicle to NASA that will perform as expected in extreme environments.\" All missions that are launched must endure the intense vibration, acoustic stresses and an array of other harsh conditions that are required for them to reach their various destinations. Even after InSight reaches orbit, its trials will not end. While the shaking and pressures caused by launch might have ceased, it must then survive the extreme cold and vacuum that is space. The battery of tests the lander is now undergoing will help to look for any issues that can then be addressed prior to flight. In order to determine how the lander handles the stresses of launch, cruise, landing, and the extreme Martian environment, it will be exposed to various tests: reverberant acoustic, thermal vacuum test, separation and deployment shock, internal electromagnetic interference and compatibility testing, as well as a second thermal vacuum test. The second thermal vacuum test is important in terms of the most critical time for the spacecraft - its time on the surface of the hostile alien world. This test will subject InSight to the types of temperatures and atmospheric pressures it will experience as it operates on the surface of Mars. When LMCO was asked about what the next steps for NASA's InSight mission would be, Spath provided some details about what the lander will encounter on the road to launch to SpaceFlight Insider. \"InSight will now move through its environmental testing phase. The first of these tests will be a thermal vacuum test in the spacecraft's 'cruise' configuration used during its seven-month journey to Mars. Environmental testing will run through the end of the year. Following that, we will ship the spacecraft in early 2016 to Vandenberg Air Force Base for launch preparations,\" Spath said. The InSight lander, safely encapsulated during its long voyage to Mars, will work to provide a better understanding of the dynamics of the Martian interior. The spacecraft will land on the surface of Mars in September 2016 and complete its primary mission in September 2018. \"It's great to see the spacecraft put together in its launch configuration,\" said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"Many teams from across the globe have worked long hours to get their elements of the system delivered for these tests.

InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) is a NASA Discovery Program mission that will send a lander to the Red Planet, which will delve deeper into the planet's surface than any other spacecraft. Previous missions to Mars have investigated the surface history of the planet by examining features like canyons, volcanoes, rocks and soil, but no one has attempted to investigate the planet's earliest evolution - its building blocks - which can only be found by looking far below the surface. The InSight mission will seek to understand the evolutionary formation of rocky planets, including Earth, by investigating the interior structure and processes of Mars. The mission will also investigate the dynamics of Martian tectonic activity and meteorite impacts, which could offer clues about such phenomena on Earth. The InSight lander is about the size of a car and will be equipped with science instruments that will conduct the first 'check-up' of Mars in more than 4.5 billion years. The science payload is comprised of two instruments: the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) and the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3). In addition, the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE) will use the spacecraft communication system to provide precise measurements of planetary rotation. The current testing will help ensure the InSight can operate in and survive deep space travel and the harsh conditions of the Martian surface.

NASA first confirmed defects with SEIS on Dec. 3, saying the instrument had suffered \"a leak in the vacuum container carrying its main sensors.\" The leak disclosed Dec. 3 was caused by a defective weld on the instrument's vacuum tank, CNES President Jean-Yves Le Gall told SpaceNews Dec. 8. At the time, Le Gall said CNES had performed a new weld that should have fixed the problem. Apparently, it did not. NASA selected InSight as the 12th in its Discovery mission in 2012, setting a cost-cap of $425 million in 2010 dollars, excluding launch. The lander, based on the Mars Phoenix craft that touched down on the red planet in 2008, beat out a comet-hopping probe and a vessel designed to sail the hydrocarbon seas of Saturn's moon Titan to win NASA funding.

However, it was suspended in December 2015 due to a fault in its main science instrument, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure. Professor Tom Pike , from Imperial's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, has been helping to build a microseismometer, around the size and weight of a one pound coin. It is part of the SEIS instrumentation and when switched on it will be able to detect microscopic tremors that may be rippling under the surface of Mars. Colin Smith caught up with Professor Pike to find out what impact the mission may have on our understanding of rocky world's like Earth, Venus, Mercury and planets beyond our solar system. What can Martian tremors tell us about rocky planets? The vibrations caused by tremors beneath Earth's surface have helped us to understand in great detail the inner structure of our planet. We use seismic devices to work out how these vibrations, which are mostly unfelt, travel below us. This gives us the densities and types of material that make up our Earth. However, at the moment, we can only speculate about what's inside the other rocky planets because we don't have any concrete data. Better knowledge of the interior of just one other planet will allow us to improve our understanding of how planets like Earth emerged and evolved in the early period of the solar system. That's not only important for our own planet's origin, but it will also help us to understand how planets beyond our solar system might be formed. So how will you detect these tremors? We use seismometers, which in very basic terms consist of a mass on a spring. The idea is that any tiny vibrations produced by Marsquakes will cause the mass to shake, and we will be able to detect these very small movements and transmit the data back to Earth for analysis. There are two types of seismometers, one built by us in the UK and another by a French team. We are using silicon micromachining techniques to form our mass and spring out of a single crystal of silicon. We designed it and built it here in the micro- fabrication cleanrooms of Imperial's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. What will the tremors actually teach you? We hope to be able to learn more about Mars' interior, and in particular if it has a molten core and we can use this information to determine if Mars ever had a magnetic field. For Earth the magnetic field is generated by electric currents from convection in the molten core. This field radiates from Earth like a protective blanket, shielding us from many of the Sun's harmful particles that are produced by the same nuclear processes that produce the Sun's light. We think that early Mars also had a magnetic field, which slowly weakened, leading to the decline of its atmosphere as the solar particles were then able to strip it away. Our mission may provide more concrete facts about how this may have happened. What are the main technical challenges? The tremors produced by a Marsquake are likely to be so small any heat loss in the suspension might drown out their signal. For the UK instrument, we have minimised this by using a single crystal silicon and we use a unique, and patented, geometry in its design to reduce the heat losses as the mass moves through the air. The French team took a different approach and put their metal suspension in a vacuum to reduce the losses. This should allow them to see even smaller signals but it's an additional complexity and it adds weight. Unfortunately, their vacuum enclosure failed a few months before launch and they were unable to repair it in time for it to get on board the rocket for the 2016 launch window to Mars. We were bolted into the payload and ready to go, but we didn't get any further than Toulouse! The French, with the help of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, have been busy since January fixing their seismometer. What's the new launch date and how will you be involved after then? NASA have just given us the go-ahead for a May 2018 launch, and the mission should touch down in around two years' time. We'll be busy even before we land as we will be able to run our instrument on the way to Mars. There's not much to detect in deep space, but it turns out that it is a good way to further test the performance of our seismometer. Our first job after landing will be to get our seismic station off the deck of the spacecraft and on to the best patch of ground we can reach with our robot arm. Our microseismometer is able to start listening even while we're still on the deck, mostly to the creaks and groans of the lander, and we'll be busy trying to work out the quietest place to set it down which will muffle the spacecraft's unwanted signal. We'll be out at mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, USA, for this critical stage of the mission. When we've finished remotely setting the SEIS on the Martian surface, we'll head back to London and start listening in earnest for any activity inside the planet. I'm hoping we will detect our first marsquakes before the end of 2018.

We use seismometers, which in very basic terms consist of a mass on a spring. The idea is that any tiny vibrations produced by Marsquakes will cause the mass to shake, and we will be able to detect these very small movements and transmit the data back to Earth for analysis. There are two types of seismometers, one built by us in the UK and another by a French team. We are using silicon micromachining techniques to form our mass and spring out of a single crystal of silicon. We designed it and built it here in the micro- fabrication cleanrooms of Imperial's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. What will the tremors actually teach you? We hope to be able to learn more about Mars' interior, and in particular if it has a molten core and we can use this information to determine if Mars ever had a magnetic field. For Earth the magnetic field is generated by electric currents from convection in the molten core. This field radiates from Earth like a protective blanket, shielding us from many of the Sun's harmful particles that are produced by the same nuclear processes that produce the Sun's light. We think that early Mars also had a magnetic field, which slowly weakened, leading to the decline of its atmosphere as the solar particles were then able to strip it away. Our mission may provide more concrete facts about how this may have happened. What are the main technical challenges? The tremors produced by a Marsquake are likely to be so small any heat loss in the suspension might drown out their signal. For the UK instrument, we have minimised this by using a single crystal silicon and we use a unique, and patented, geometry in its design to reduce the heat losses as the mass moves through the air. The French team took a different approach and put their metal suspension in a vacuum to reduce the losses. This should allow them to see even smaller signals but it's an additional complexity and it adds weight. Unfortunately, their vacuum enclosure failed a few months before launch and they were unable to repair it in time for it to get on board the rocket for the 2016 launch window to Mars. We were bolted into the payload and ready to go, but we didn't get any further than Toulouse! The French, with the help of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, have been busy since January fixing their seismometer. What's the new launch date and how will you be involved after then? NASA have just given us the go-ahead for a May 2018 launch, and the mission should touch down in around two years' time. We'll be busy even before we land as we will be able to run our instrument on the way to Mars. There's not much to detect in deep space, but it turns out that it is a good way to further test the performance of our seismometer. Our first job after landing will be to get our seismic station off the deck of the spacecraft and on to the best patch of ground we can reach with our robot arm. Our microseismometer is able to start listening even while we're still on the deck, mostly to the creaks and groans of the lander, and we'll be busy trying to work out the quietest place to set it down which will muffle the spacecraft's unwanted signal. We'll be out at mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, USA, for this critical stage of the mission. When we've finished remotely setting the SEIS on the Martian surface, we'll head back to London and start listening in earnest for any activity inside the planet. I'm hoping we will detect our first marsquakes before the end of 2018.

InSight's solar arrays were deployed for the final test, unfurling into large circular panels that will provide power to the lander. \"This was our last major test before we start building up into a launch configuration,\" Scott Daniels of Lockheed Space told Space.com. \"This test worked really successfully.\" \"Mechanical inspections looked really good and clean,\" he added. \"Everything happened when it was supposed to happen.\" Unlike the Curiosity Rover, the InSight lander (short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport) won't be wandering around the surface of the planet taking selfies. Rather, it's designed to plumb the depths of the red planet using an array of seismic sensors to monitor \"Marsquakes\" and other geologic activity deep below the surface. The landing site is an area known as the Elysium Planitia, near the Martian equator. It's an unremarkable, flat landing spot - and that's a good thing, according to scientists. \"Just a bland, normal place,\" said Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"We've mapped the topography of Mars, the geology, and we have a good characterization of the planet's atmosphere, ionosphere and exosphere.

Then its trajectory continued to the north, passing close to India, and finally near Alaska, where the InSight spacecraft separated from the rocket to continue its journey to Mars. The spacecraft's separation from the rocket occurred about 90 minutes after launch. A full replay of launch coverage is below: Six months from now, during Insight's entry, descent and landing, NASA will use the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to record the descent data as it passes over InSight's landing site on Mars, transmitting it to Earth during a later orbit. Landing on Mars is hard, and some spacecraft have crashed while attempting it. Before the Curiosity rover mission landed in 2012, the mission team described that lander's planned descent through Mars' thin atmosphere and landing attempt as seven minutes of terror. InSight will be landing in a way similar to Curiosity. InSight will enter Mars' atmosphere at 14,100 miles per hour. During the entry phase, it will use very small rockets to adjust its initial trajectory toward the surface. Then it uses a large parachute, and then 12 descent engines, or \"retrojets,\" whose firings will be continuously adjusted by an onboard computer in order to keep the spacecraft leveled and slowing down until the moment of touchdown. This type of landing technology was successfully used by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in 1976, and by the Phoenix lander in 2008. The Curiosity rover, which descended on Mars on 2012, added a skycrane with cables to this technology, to avoid dust over the rover's instruments and cameras. After an early-morning liftoff from California, the NASA InSight mission is now on its way to Mars. Image via NASA Solar System Exploration. By the way, launched on the same rocket as Insight was a separate NASA technology experiment known as Mars Cube One. MarCO consists of two mini-spacecraft - nicknamed Wall-E and Eva by space engineers - and will be the first test of CubeSat communications and navigation technologies in deep space. Following the Insight launch on May 5, NASA received radio signals indicating the two CubeSats are alive and well. InSight Mars will attempt to land in Elysium Planitia, an area not far from Curiosity's landing site, along the equator of the red planet. Once InSight is safe on the surface of Mars, signals from it will be received by three radio telescopes: the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy's facility at Effelsberg, Germany; the Institute of Radio Astronomy of Bologna's Sardinia Radio Telescope, on the Italian island of Sardinia; and the National Science Foundation's Green Bank Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia. Another orbiter from NASA, Mars Odyssey, is expected to provide more information about InSight, as it flies over the small lander after the entry, descent and landing process. In past decades, orbiters have peered down on Mars from above, and robotic rovers have crept along its surface. InSight Mars is designed to study what's _inside_ Mars. The stationary lander - similar to the 2008 Phoenix lander on the red planet - will help scientists understand how the rocky planets in our solar system - like Mars, Venus and Earth - formed. The mission's objective is to detect seismic activity on Mars and analyze the subsurface by studying the thickness and size of Mars' core, mantle and crust. InSight will also detect the frequency of ongoing meteorite impacts. Mars is closer than Earth to the asteroid belt, which lies between it and the next planet outward, Jupiter. Mars' atmosphere is thinner than Earth's. These two conditions might contribute to hundreds of small space rocks reaching the surface of our neighboring planet. The solar-powered lander will deploy a seismometer built by the Centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales from the French Space Agency. It also contains a heat probe to monitor heat flow from Mars' interior, which was provided by the German Aerospace Center, and other instruments built by Italy, Spain, and NASA's JPL. The mission is scheduled to last two years. 2018 is Mars' year and not just because of Insight Mars. For us earthbound observers, Mars will appear especially bright in our sky, due to a close encounter with Earth this summer. 2018 will offer the best Mars viewing since 2003, which was the best viewing in some 60,000 years. In addition to providing earthly skywatchers with grand views of the red planet's features through a telescope, this 2018 opposition of Mars also provides a good opportunity to send a Mars spacecraft winging its way.

Saturday's launch of the InSight lander bound for Mars is no exception. Its two-year mission: to generate the first map of the interior of the red planet - if its science instruments can land on the surface in good working order. But when it comes to the tricky process known as entry, descent and landing, or EDL, NASA Langley has always had the right stuff. In fact, Langley engineers and scientists were the first to put landers safely on the Martian surface back in the 1970s. And, in 2012, they finessed the landing of the Curiosity science rover - to date, the heaviest payload ever to land on Mars. \"We're NASA's EDL center,\" said Robert Maddock, leader of the InSight EDL team at the Hampton research center. \"We're involved in things beyond Mars - Titan probes and Venus probes and anything that has to fly through an atmosphere and get to the ground.\" InSight stands for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. And its mission is unique, going beyond where others have gone before. \"We've spent a lot of time with landers looking at the surface and orbiters looking at the atmosphere and the surface,\" said Maddock. \"But this is really going to be the first time we're going to look deep into Mars' surface. To understand more the geology, what's going on inside.\" Such knowledge can inform our understanding of how other rocky bodies, including our own Earth and moon, formed and evolved over time, and where they may be headed. InSight can also help identify subsurface resources, or perhaps even subsurface dangers, for any potential human colonists. The lander is set to deploy a blazingly sensitive seismometer to gather new data on the sound waves generated by marsquakes and meteor strikes. Those waves will be used to craft a sonogram of sorts of Mars' interior. InSight also will deploy a thermal probe known as the \"mole\" to dig 3 to 5 meters under the surface and sniff out what lies there. Temperature measurements it takes along the way will offer key information about the planet's core and how it stores and releases energy. First, though, InSight must travel 300 million miles through the solar system before arriving at its destination in late November. All the while, Lockheed Martin, which built the spacecraft for NASA, will carefully monitor its health. Maddock and his team will measure such crucial data against thousands upon thousands of computer simulations they ran over several years as they dreamed up countless potential landing scenarios to help design the best possible spacecraft and landing system. During the journey, as data comes in, they'll have many more opportunities to make any necessary tweaks to the flight software. \"We will update things as we become smarter along the way,\" Maddock said. \"And we will continually do these evaluations all the way up through a couple hours before landing.\" Still, said flight dynamics engineer Carlie Zumwalt, it's impossible to know in advance the precise environment and conditions the craft will encounter as it lands. Mars, for instance, has notoriously unpredictable weather. \"They have these gigantic dust storms that can roll in and roll out, kind of on a whim,\" Zumwalt said. \"We're going to land seven months from now, (but) we have to design our system for an atmosphere and environment that we can't predict seven months in the future.\" Traveling along with InSight will be the first CubeSats ever launched into interplanetary space. The small satellites will be used to test new communications technologies to relay information between InSight and Earth, especially as the craft lands, said flight dynamics engineer Daniel Litton. Finally, around 3 p.m. on Nov. 26, InSight is scheduled to set down in a place called Elysium Planitia, a massive, flat plain, empty enough to offer a safe landing site. Still, it's always tricky landing payload on Mars because the planet's thin atmosphere offers little purchase for a parachute to slow a spacecraft down from blistering entry speeds. According to NASA, entry will begin about 80 miles above the Martian surface, at a speed of 13,200 mph. About 3 1/2 minutes later, at 7.5 miles above the surface and roaring along at 928 mph, the spacecraft's parachute will deploy. Seconds later, the craft will jettison its heat shield, deploy its landing legs and fire up its thrusters. About half a mile above the surface, zipping down at 136 mph, the lander will separate as its thrusters carry it to what NASA hopes will be a safe touchdown. Maddock says he's \"very confident\" that InSight will nail its landing because the craft is essentially a version of the earlier Phoenix Mars lander, albeit heavier and expected to enter at a higher elevation with a thinner atmosphere to help slow it down. Even after the landing, he said, the team will reconstruct what actually happened in order to build better predictions and simulations in future. After it's settled, and for nearly two Earth years, NASA says, InSight is tasked to listen to the Martian heartbeat and probe its depths, helping humans build a more complete picture of the planet. \"As we continue to gain momentum in our work to send astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars,\" NASA's new administrator, Jim Bridenstine, said in a recent statement, \"missions like InSight are going to prove invaluable.\" ", "url": "https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-nws-nasa-insight-mission-20180507-story.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's InSight lander passes its final tests, ready for the trip to Mars", "date": "2018-02-10", "content": "The next mission to the red planet just passed its final pre-flight tests, and engineers say it's now ready to \"ship and shoot.\" The InSight Mars lander will soon be transported from the Lockheed Martin test facility in Colorado to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California for a scheduled May 5 launch aboard an Atlas V rocket. InSight's solar arrays were deployed for the final test, unfurling into large circular panels that will provide power to the lander. \"This was our last major test before we start building up into a launch configuration,\" Scott Daniels of Lockheed Space told Space.com. \"This test worked really successfully.\" \"Mechanical inspections looked really good and clean,\" he added. \"Everything happened when it was supposed to happen.\" Unlike the Curiosity Rover, the InSight lander (short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport) won't be wandering around the surface of the planet taking selfies. Rather, it's designed to plumb the depths of the red planet using an array of seismic sensors to monitor \"Marsquakes\" and other geologic activity deep below the surface. The landing site is an area known as the Elysium Planitia, near the Martian equator. It's an unremarkable, flat landing spot - and that's a good thing, according to scientists. \"Just a bland, normal place,\" said Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"We've mapped the topography of Mars, the geology, and we have a good characterization of the planet's atmosphere, ionosphere and exosphere. The deep interior of Mars was sort of the last piece in that puzzle.\" The mission was originally planned for 2016, but a leak in one of the seismometers forced NASA to abort the mission. The lengthy delay was due to the fact that Earth and Mars are only in a favorable alignment once every 26 months. If all goes well, the lander will touch down on Mars in November 2018. The InSight Lander will also be carrying an unusual cargo - two tiny microchips containing the names of more than 2.4 million people. NASA invited the public to sign up at its website, and millions of would-be space travelers responded. Among those was the original Captain Kirk, William Shatner. NASA issued a \"boarding pass\" to everyone who participated, and Shatner shared his with his flowers on Twitter. Although a manned expedition to Mars is still some years away, missions like the InSight Lander and the upcoming new Mars rover in 2020 get us closer to the red planet every year.", "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/nasa-insight-mars-lander-ready-for-mission/"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight passes solar wing test", "date": "2018-02-12", "content": "NASA's next Mars lander, InSight, has passed a critical test in preparation for its first mission to explore Mars' deep interior.

It will investigate processes that shaped the rocky planets of the inner solar system (including Earth) more than four billion years ago. The solar wing test took place at a cleanroom operated by Lockheed Martin Space. The environment controlled facility is located just outside of Denver, where InSight was built and has been undergoing testing ahead of its launch. The mission is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This is the last time we will see the spacecraft in landed configuration before it arrives a the Red Planet,\" said Scott Daniels, Manager at Lockheed Martin InSight Assembly, Test and Launch Operations (ATLO). He added: \"There are still many steps we have to take before launch, but this is a critical milestone before shipping to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\" The InSight launch window opens in May. The solar arrays on NASA's InSight Mars lander were deployed as part of testing conducted on 23 January 2018, at Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado. Engineers and technicians evaluated the solar arrays and performed an illumination test to confirm that the solar cells were collecting power. The fan-like solar panels are specially designed for Mars' weak sunlight, caused by the planet's distance from the Sun and its dusty, thin atmosphere. The panels will power InSight for at least one Martian year (two Earth years) for the first mission dedicated to studying Mars' deep interior. \"Think of InSight as Mars' first health check-up in more than 4.5 billion years,\" said Bruce Banerdt of JPL, the mission's principal investigator. \"We'll study its pulse by 'listening' for marsquakes with a seismometer. We'll take its temperature with a heat probe. And we'll check its reflexes with a radio experiment.\" Technicians at Lockheed Martin Space installed a microchip with 1.6 million names submitted by the public to ride along with NASA's InSight mission to Mars. The microchip joins a chip containing almost 827,000 names that was glued to the top of InSight back in 2015, adding up to a total of about 2.4 million names going to Mars. \"It's a fun way for the public to feel personally invested in the mission,\" Banerdt said. \"We're happy to have them along for the ride.\" The chips were inscribed at JPL's Microdevices Laboratory, which has added names and images to a number of spacecraft, including the Mars Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity rovers.

InSight will be the first mission to look deep beneath the Martian surface, studying the planet's interior by listening for marsquakes and measuring the planet's heat output. It will also be the first planetary spacecraft to launch from the West Coast. \"The Air Force C-17 crew from the 21st Airlift Squadron gave us a great ride,\" said Tom Hoffman, InSight project manager, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Next time InSight travels as high and as fast, it will be about 23 seconds into its launch, on the way to Mars.\" At the Astrotech payload processing facility at Vandenberg, InSight will soon be removed from its shipping container -- the first of several remaining milestones to prepare it for launch. Later next week, the spacecraft will begin functional testing to verify its state of health after the flight from Colorado. After that, the team will load updated flight software and perform a series of mission readiness tests. These tests involve the entire spacecraft flight system, the associated science instruments and the ground data system. \"One of the most important activities before launch is to load the spacecraft with the fuel needed for the journey to Mars,\" said Hoffman. \"After fuel loading, the spacecraft will undergo a spin-balance test to determine precisely the center of mass.

InSight will use the seismic waves generated by marsquakes to map the deep interior of Mars. These waves travel through geologic materials at different speeds and reflect off boundaries, giving scientists a glimpse of the composition and structure of the planet's interior.

And, in 2012, they finessed the landing of the Curiosity science rover - to date, the heaviest payload ever to land on Mars. \"We're NASA's EDL center,\" said Robert Maddock, leader of the InSight EDL team at the Hampton research center. \"We're involved in things beyond Mars - Titan probes and Venus probes and anything that has to fly through an atmosphere and get to the ground.\" InSight stands for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. And its mission is unique, going beyond where others have gone before. \"We've spent a lot of time with landers looking at the surface and orbiters looking at the atmosphere and the surface,\" said Maddock. \"But this is really going to be the first time we're going to look deep into Mars' surface. To understand more the geology, what's going on inside.\" Such knowledge can inform our understanding of how other rocky bodies, including our own Earth and moon, formed and evolved over time, and where they may be headed. InSight can also help identify subsurface resources, or perhaps even subsurface dangers, for any potential human colonists. The lander is set to deploy a blazingly sensitive seismometer to gather new data on the sound waves generated by marsquakes and meteor strikes. Those waves will be used to craft a sonogram of sorts of Mars' interior. InSight also will deploy a thermal probe known as the \"mole\" to dig 3 to 5 meters under the surface and sniff out what lies there. Temperature measurements it takes along the way will offer key information about the planet's core and how it stores and releases energy. First, though, InSight must travel 300 million miles through the solar system before arriving at its destination in late November. All the while, Lockheed Martin, which built the spacecraft for NASA, will carefully monitor its health. Maddock and his team will measure such crucial data against thousands upon thousands of computer simulations they ran over several years as they dreamed up countless potential landing scenarios to help design the best possible spacecraft and landing system. During the journey, as data comes in, they'll have many more opportunities to make any necessary tweaks to the flight software. \"We will update things as we become smarter along the way,\" Maddock said. \"And we will continually do these evaluations all the way up through a couple hours before landing.\" Still, said flight dynamics engineer Carlie Zumwalt, it's impossible to know in advance the precise environment and conditions the craft will encounter as it lands. Mars, for instance, has notoriously unpredictable weather. \"They have these gigantic dust storms that can roll in and roll out, kind of on a whim,\" Zumwalt said. \"We're going to land seven months from now, (but) we have to design our system for an atmosphere and environment that we can't predict seven months in the future.\" Traveling along with InSight will be the first CubeSats ever launched into interplanetary space. The small satellites will be used to test new communications technologies to relay information between InSight and Earth, especially as the craft lands, said flight dynamics engineer Daniel Litton. Finally, around 3 p.m. on Nov. 26, InSight is scheduled to set down in a place called Elysium Planitia, a massive, flat plain, empty enough to offer a safe landing site. Still, it's always tricky landing payload on Mars because the planet's thin atmosphere offers little purchase for a parachute to slow a spacecraft down from blistering entry speeds. According to NASA, entry will begin about 80 miles above the Martian surface, at a speed of 13,200 mph. About 3 1/2 minutes later, at 7.5 miles above the surface and roaring along at 928 mph, the spacecraft's parachute will deploy. Seconds later, the craft will jettison its heat shield, deploy its landing legs and fire up its thrusters. About half a mile above the surface, zipping down at 136 mph, the lander will separate as its thrusters carry it to what NASA hopes will be a safe touchdown. Maddock says he's \"very confident\" that InSight will nail its landing because the craft is essentially a version of the earlier Phoenix Mars lander, albeit heavier and expected to enter at a higher elevation with a thinner atmosphere to help slow it down. Even after the landing, he said, the team will reconstruct what actually happened in order to build better predictions and simulations in future. After it's settled, and for nearly two Earth years, NASA says, InSight is tasked to listen to the Martian heartbeat and probe its depths, helping humans build a more complete picture of the planet. \"As we continue to gain momentum in our work to send astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars,\" NASA's new administrator, Jim Bridenstine, said in a recent statement, \"missions like InSight are going to prove invaluable.\" ", "url": "https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-nws-nasa-insight-mission-20180507-story.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Mars Lander Arrives at Launch Site to Prep for May Liftoff", "date": "2018-03-02", "content": "A NASA spacecraft that will probe the deep Martian interior has arrived at its launch site to prep for its planned May liftoff. The InSight lander touched down at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California yesterday afternoon aboard a C-17 cargo plane, NASA officials said. InSight made the trip from the Denver facilities of the company that built it, Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"The Air Force C-17 crew from the 21st Airlift Squadron gave us a great ride,\" InSight project manager Tom Hoffman, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. \"Next time InSight travels as high and as fast, it will be about 23 seconds into its launch, on the way to Mars.\" That launch is scheduled to take place during a five-week window that opens May 5. InSight will ride atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket that lifts off from Vandenberg, in the process becoming the first planetary mission ever to launch from the U.S. West Coast, NASA officials said. Engineers and technicians will perform a number of tests on InSight between now and May 5, to make sure that the craft survived its trip from Colorado in good health and to get it ready for liftoff. A truck carrying NASA's InSight spacecraft leaves Lockheed Martin Space in Denver, where the spacecraft was built and tested, on Feb. 28, 2018, headed for Buckley Air Force Base. At Buckley, InSight was loaded into a cargo plane, which flew it to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. \"One of the most important activities before launch is to load the spacecraft with the fuel needed for the journey to Mars,\" Hoffman said. \"After fuel loading, the spacecraft will undergo a spin-balance test to determine precisely the center of mass. This knowledge is needed to be sure the entry and descent into the Mars atmosphere goes as planned.\" If all does go according to plan, InSight - whose name is short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport - will touch down on Mars in November, then begin studying the Red Planet's interior using two main science instruments. One is a heat probe that will hammer itself about 16 feet underground, and the other is a suite of supersensitive seismometers known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure. InSight's observations should reveal a great deal about Mars' structure and composition, leading to a better understanding of how rocky planets form and evolve, mission team members have said. The solar-powered lander was originally scheduled to launch in March 2016, but a leak in the vacuum chamber surrounding SEIS' seismometers delayed the liftoff. InSight will also carry to Mars the names of several million people, including \"Star Trek\" actor William Shatner, aboard two specially engraved microchips.

InSight's lander is due to set down on Mars' surface in November 2018. InSight was the first planetary mission to launch from the U.S. West Coast. Awesome shot of Insight Mars from Alex Ustick in California. It was foggy at the launch site, but many caught Insight climbing to space. Notice Jupiter! The Atlas V rocket reached an initial parking orbit at an altitude of 115 miles about 13 minutes after launch, when the rocket was about 1,200 miles northwest of Isabella Island, Ecuador. It then passed over Tierra del Fuego and Antarctica. Then its trajectory continued to the north, passing close to India, and finally near Alaska, where the InSight spacecraft separated from the rocket to continue its journey to Mars. The spacecraft's separation from the rocket occurred about 90 minutes after launch. A full replay of launch coverage is below: Six months from now, during Insight's entry, descent and landing, NASA will use the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to record the descent data as it passes over InSight's landing site on Mars, transmitting it to Earth during a later orbit. Landing on Mars is hard, and some spacecraft have crashed while attempting it. Before the Curiosity rover mission landed in 2012, the mission team described that lander's planned descent through Mars' thin atmosphere and landing attempt as seven minutes of terror. InSight will be landing in a way similar to Curiosity. InSight will enter Mars' atmosphere at 14,100 miles per hour. During the entry phase, it will use very small rockets to adjust its initial trajectory toward the surface. Then it uses a large parachute, and then 12 descent engines, or \"retrojets,\" whose firings will be continuously adjusted by an onboard computer in order to keep the spacecraft leveled and slowing down until the moment of touchdown. This type of landing technology was successfully used by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in 1976, and by the Phoenix lander in 2008. The Curiosity rover, which descended on Mars on 2012, added a skycrane with cables to this technology, to avoid dust over the rover's instruments and cameras. After an early-morning liftoff from California, the NASA InSight mission is now on its way to Mars. Image via NASA Solar System Exploration. By the way, launched on the same rocket as Insight was a separate NASA technology experiment known as Mars Cube One. MarCO consists of two mini-spacecraft - nicknamed Wall-E and Eva by space engineers - and will be the first test of CubeSat communications and navigation technologies in deep space. Following the Insight launch on May 5, NASA received radio signals indicating the two CubeSats are alive and well. InSight Mars will attempt to land in Elysium Planitia, an area not far from Curiosity's landing site, along the equator of the red planet. Once InSight is safe on the surface of Mars, signals from it will be received by three radio telescopes: the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy's facility at Effelsberg, Germany; the Institute of Radio Astronomy of Bologna's Sardinia Radio Telescope, on the Italian island of Sardinia; and the National Science Foundation's Green Bank Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia. Another orbiter from NASA, Mars Odyssey, is expected to provide more information about InSight, as it flies over the small lander after the entry, descent and landing process. In past decades, orbiters have peered down on Mars from above, and robotic rovers have crept along its surface. InSight Mars is designed to study what's _inside_ Mars. The stationary lander - similar to the 2008 Phoenix lander on the red planet - will help scientists understand how the rocky planets in our solar system - like Mars, Venus and Earth - formed. The mission's objective is to detect seismic activity on Mars and analyze the subsurface by studying the thickness and size of Mars' core, mantle and crust. InSight will also detect the frequency of ongoing meteorite impacts. Mars is closer than Earth to the asteroid belt, which lies between it and the next planet outward, Jupiter. Mars' atmosphere is thinner than Earth's. These two conditions might contribute to hundreds of small space rocks reaching the surface of our neighboring planet. The solar-powered lander will deploy a seismometer built by the Centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales from the French Space Agency. It also contains a heat probe to monitor heat flow from Mars' interior, which was provided by the German Aerospace Center, and other instruments built by Italy, Spain, and NASA's JPL. The mission is scheduled to last two years. 2018 is Mars' year and not just because of Insight Mars. For us earthbound observers, Mars will appear especially bright in our sky, due to a close encounter with Earth this summer. 2018 will offer the best Mars viewing since 2003, which was the best viewing in some 60,000 years. In addition to providing earthly skywatchers with grand views of the red planet's features through a telescope, this 2018 opposition of Mars also provides a good opportunity to send a Mars spacecraft winging its way.

But the lander is not alone-it has a pair of twin communication CubeSats in tow. Called MarCO-A and MarCO-B, the tiny machines have already passed the first important milestone in their groundbreaking mission to the Red Planet. When MarCO-A and MarCO-B arrive at Mars later this year, they'll be the smallest machines to ever visit another planet. Known as nanosatellites, these devices weigh a mere 30 pounds each, and measure just 14.4 inches by 9.5 inches by 4.6 inches when packed into a rocket's cargo hold. Once at Mars, the tiny satellites will provide a communications link with stations on Earth as InSight makes its perilous entry to the surface. But NASA's lander is not dependant on Mars Cube One for its success; the CubeSats are involved in a proof-of-concept mission to test the viability of sending small satellites to the outer reaches of the Solar System. NASA received the first signals from MarCO-A and MarCO-B on Saturday at 3:15 pm ET, shortly after the launch. The receipt of these signals is good news-it means the devices switched on and booted-up. But the signal also means that the CubeSats successfully unfurled their solar panels, stabilized their orientation, turned towards the Sun, and switched on their radios. NASA engineers still need to conduct a series of tests before the CubeSats begin their journey to Mars, but early indications suggest the machines are working properly. MarCO-A and MarCO-B will then spend the next half-year traveling to Mars. The twin CubeSats are redundant versions of each other, deployed as a pair should one of them malfunction. Their closest approach to Mars, scheduled for November 26, 2018, will be at a distance of 2,175 miles. During this critical phase of the mission, dubbed the Seven Minutes of Terror, the CubeSats will monitor InSight's progress, providing information to mission controllers during a phase that normally goes dark. MarCO-A and MarCO-B will track InSight's progress, and relay information back to Earth at a rate of eight kilobits per second over UHF, and in near-real time. As noted, InSight doesn't need MarCO to succeed. Once the probe has landed safely on Mars, InSight will use NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Earth-based stations for its communications needs. NASA scientists are using the mission to understand if and how CubeSats can work in deep space, testing their endurance and navigational abilities. Should all go well, NASA can start to think about similar missions to other Solar System bodies, such as the outer gas planets and possibly even the Kuiper Belt.

Shooting through space at speeds of 6,200 miles per hour (10,000 km/h), the InSight mission is expected to land on Mars on November 26. Since launch and until that moment, the spacecraft has been and will be monitored by the space agency almost continuously, including with the help of a pair of mini-satellites from the CubeSat family. Since its launch from Earth in May, InSight's trajectory has been corrected a few times. The first and the biggest such trajectory correction maneuvers took place on May 22 and required the thrusters to be fired for about 40 seconds. The use of the thrusters had an impact on velocity measured at 3.8 meters per second (8.5 mph). Until the time it lands, NASA said an additional five or six such maneuvers might need to be performed. Although there is only half the distance left to cover, NASA will not land the spacecraft on Mars until November 26 because it will require additional time for preparation for entry, descent, landing and surface operation. InSight is an acronym for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The lander is meant to study Mars' deep interior using seismology and other geophysical measurements. The instrument platform was built back in 2010 and was initially planned to travel to Mars in 2016. Because of a failure to one of the instruments, the launch was canceled. As for the two satellites accompanying the mission, they will be used to track and follow the lander through space, with their ultimate task being their recording of the spacecraft's entry in the Martian atmosphere.

All of its instruments have been tested and are working well. As of 20 August, the spacecraft had covered 172 million miles since its launch 107 days ago. In another 98 days, it will travel another 129 million miles and touch down in Mars' Elysium Planitia region, where it will be the first mission to study the Red Planet's deep interior. InSight stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The InSight team is using the time before the spacecraft's arrival at Mars to not only plan and practice for that critical day, but also to activate and check spacecraft subsystems vital to cruise, landing and surface operations, including the highly sensitive science instruments. InSight's seismometer, which will be used to detect quakes on Mars, received a clean bill of health on 19 July. The SEIS instrument is a six-sensor seismometer combining two types of sensors to measure ground motions over a wide range of frequencies. It will give scientists a window into Mars' internal activity. \"We did our final performance checks on July 19, which were successful,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. The team also checked an instrument that will measure the amount of heat escaping from Mars. After being placed on the surface, InSight's Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument will use a self-hammering mechanical mole burrowing to a depth of 10 to 16 feet. Measurements by sensors on the mole and on a science tether from the mole to the surface will yield the first precise determination of the amount of heat escaping from the planet's interior. The checkout consisted of powering on the main electronics for the instrument, performing checks of its instrument sensor elements, exercising some of the instrument's internal heaters, and reading out the stored settings in the electronics module. The third of InSight's three main investigations - Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment - uses the spacecraft's radio connection with Earth to assess perturbations of Mars' rotation axis. These measurements can provide information about the planet's core. \"We have been using the spacecraft's radio since launch day, and our conversations with InSight have been very cordial, so we are good to go with RISE as well,\" said Banerdt. The lander's cameras checked out fine as well, taking a spacecraft selfie of the inside of the spacecraft's backshell. InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman from JPL said that, \"If you are an engineer on InSight, that first glimpse of the heat shield blanket, harness tie-downs and cover bolts is a very reassuring sight as it tells us our Instrument Context Camera is operating perfectly. The next picture we plan to take with this camera will be of the surface of Mars.\" If all goes as planned, the camera will take the first image of Elysium Planitia minutes after InSight touches down on Mars.

MarCO-A and MarCO-B will then spend the next half-year traveling to Mars. The twin CubeSats are redundant versions of each other, deployed as a pair should one of them malfunction. Their closest approach to Mars, scheduled for November 26, 2018, will be at a distance of 2,175 miles. During this critical phase of the mission, dubbed the Seven Minutes of Terror, the CubeSats will monitor InSight's progress, providing information to mission controllers during a phase that normally goes dark. MarCO-A and MarCO-B will track InSight's progress, and relay information back to Earth at a rate of eight kilobits per second over UHF, and in near-real time. As noted, InSight doesn't need MarCO to succeed. Once the probe has landed safely on Mars, InSight will use NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Earth-based stations for its communications needs. NASA scientists are using the mission to understand if and how CubeSats can work in deep space, testing their endurance and navigational abilities. Should all go well, NASA can start to think about similar missions to other Solar System bodies, such as the outer gas planets and possibly even the Kuiper Belt.

Saturday's launch of the InSight lander bound for Mars is no exception. Its two-year mission: to generate the first map of the interior of the red planet - if its science instruments can land on the surface in good working order. But when it comes to the tricky process known as entry, descent and landing, or EDL, NASA Langley has always had the right stuff. In fact, Langley engineers and scientists were the first to put landers safely on the Martian surface back in the 1970s. And, in 2012, they finessed the landing of the Curiosity science rover - to date, the heaviest payload ever to land on Mars. \"We're NASA's EDL center,\" said Robert Maddock, leader of the InSight EDL team at the Hampton research center. \"We're involved in things beyond Mars - Titan probes and Venus probes and anything that has to fly through an atmosphere and get to the ground.\" InSight stands for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. And its mission is unique, going beyond where others have gone before. \"We've spent a lot of time with landers looking at the surface and orbiters looking at the atmosphere and the surface,\" said Maddock. \"But this is really going to be the first time we're going to look deep into Mars' surface. To understand more the geology, what's going on inside.\" Such knowledge can inform our understanding of how other rocky bodies, including our own Earth and moon, formed and evolved over time, and where they may be headed. InSight can also help identify subsurface resources, or perhaps even subsurface dangers, for any potential human colonists. The lander is set to deploy a blazingly sensitive seismometer to gather new data on the sound waves generated by marsquakes and meteor strikes. Those waves will be used to craft a sonogram of sorts of Mars' interior. InSight also will deploy a thermal probe known as the \"mole\" to dig 3 to 5 meters under the surface and sniff out what lies there. Temperature measurements it takes along the way will offer key information about the planet's core and how it stores and releases energy. First, though, InSight must travel 300 million miles through the solar system before arriving at its destination in late November. All the while, Lockheed Martin, which built the spacecraft for NASA, will carefully monitor its health. Maddock and his team will measure such crucial data against thousands upon thousands of computer simulations they ran over several years as they dreamed up countless potential landing scenarios to help design the best possible spacecraft and landing system. During the journey, as data comes in, they'll have many more opportunities to make any necessary tweaks to the flight software. \"We will update things as we become smarter along the way,\" Maddock said. \"And we will continually do these evaluations all the way up through a couple hours before landing.\" Still, said flight dynamics engineer Carlie Zumwalt, it's impossible to know in advance the precise environment and conditions the craft will encounter as it lands. Mars, for instance, has notoriously unpredictable weather. \"They have these gigantic dust storms that can roll in and roll out, kind of on a whim,\" Zumwalt said. \"We're going to land seven months from now, (but) we have to design our system for an atmosphere and environment that we can't predict seven months in the future.\" Traveling along with InSight will be the first CubeSats ever launched into interplanetary space. The small satellites will be used to test new communications technologies to relay information between InSight and Earth, especially as the craft lands, said flight dynamics engineer Daniel Litton. Finally, around 3 p.m. on Nov. 26, InSight is scheduled to set down in a place called Elysium Planitia, a massive, flat plain, empty enough to offer a safe landing site. Still, it's always tricky landing payload on Mars because the planet's thin atmosphere offers little purchase for a parachute to slow a spacecraft down from blistering entry speeds. According to NASA, entry will begin about 80 miles above the Martian surface, at a speed of 13,200 mph. About 3 1/2 minutes later, at 7.5 miles above the surface and roaring along at 928 mph, the spacecraft's parachute will deploy. Seconds later, the craft will jettison its heat shield, deploy its landing legs and fire up its thrusters. About half a mile above the surface, zipping down at 136 mph, the lander will separate as its thrusters carry it to what NASA hopes will be a safe touchdown. Maddock says he's \"very confident\" that InSight will nail its landing because the craft is essentially a version of the earlier Phoenix Mars lander, albeit heavier and expected to enter at a higher elevation with a thinner atmosphere to help slow it down. Even after the landing, he said, the team will reconstruct what actually happened in order to build better predictions and simulations in future. After it's settled, and for nearly two Earth years, NASA says, InSight is tasked to listen to the Martian heartbeat and probe its depths, helping humans build a more complete picture of the planet. \"As we continue to gain momentum in our work to send astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars,\" NASA's new administrator, Jim Bridenstine, said in a recent statement, \"missions like InSight are going to prove invaluable.\" ", "url": "https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-nws-nasa-insight-mission-20180507-story.html"}, {"title": "NASA InSight Lander Now Half Way to Mars", "date": "2018-08-07", "content": "Of the 300 million miles it has to cover before reaching the deserted sands of Mars, NASA's InSight lander has already traveled half, the space agency said earlier this week.

Scientists and project managers, speaking at a pair of briefings Nov. 21 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said there are no issues with the spacecraft, which is on course for a landing at approximately 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars just north of the planet's equator. Rob Grover, the entry, descent and landing lead for the mission, said that since the latest trajectory correction maneuver by the spacecraft Nov. 18, the spacecraft appears to be within about seven kilometers of the planned landing site. \"We're very close right now,\" he said. \"We may not need our last course correction maneuver.\" He said the project will decide by the end of the day Nov. 23 whether that maneuver, which would take place Nov. 25, is needed. Conditions at the landing site appear to be ideal for landing, he noted. The global dust storm that swept across the planet in June, shutting off contact with the Opportunity Mars rover, has long since faded, and there's been no signs of storms in the vicinity of the landing site. \"We're expecting a very plain day on Mars for the landing, and we're very happy about that,\" he said. The Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft will slow down from 5.5 kilometers per second at the beginning of the EDL phase, about 125 kilometers high, to zero in 6.5 minutes, using a combination of a heat shield, parachute and thrusters. The spacecraft will deploy its solar arrays starting 16 minutes after landing, a delay intended to allow dust kicked up by the landing to settle, with the deployment itself taking an additional 16 minutes. NASA hopes to get realtime telemetry of the landing from a pair of cubesats, called Mars Cube One, that launched as secondary payloads with InSight in May and will fly past Mars during the landing. The MarCO cubesats, intended primarily as technology demonstrations, will be able to relay the telemetry from InSight and broadcast it back to Earth. In addition, InSight itself will broadcast a \"beep\" about seven minutes after landing, a signal indicating that it is on the surface. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will be able to provide data with a brief delay, including a first image from the surface taken by the lander. Confirmation that the lander's solar panels are deployed, though, won't come until about five and a half hours after landing, after an overhead pass from the Mars Odyssey orbiter. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy its two major instruments, a French-built seismometer and a German-built heat probe that will burrow several meters into the surface. Project scientists said that process, including scouting the best locations on the ground by the lander to place the instruments, will take several months. \"InSight is kind of a laid-back, slow-motion mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for InSight at JPL. \"It's going to take us probably two to three months, at least, to get our instruments down.\" He estimated it would be \"early next spring\" before those principal instruments started returning data. One of those instruments, the seismometer, suffered development problems that forced the French space agency CNES to redesign it, pushing back InSight's launch from March 2016 to this May. \"At the beginning it was just impossible to build,\" said Philippe Lognonne, project manager for the instrument at CNES. \"But we did it with the help of our partners.\" With those instruments in place, scientists hope to learn more about the interior of Mars and compare it with other terrestrial planets, including the Earth. \"The number one question we want to answer is what's the structure and the energetics of the interior of Mars,\" Banerdt said. That includes the size and density of the planet's core, the thickness of the planet's crust and the structure of the mantle. \"I've personally have been waiting for this information for decades,\" said Sue Smrekar, deputy principal investigator for InSight at JPL, \"and I'm super excited to get this lander on the ground and start taking this data.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-prepares-for-insight-mars-landing/"}, {"title": "InSight to perform final maneuver before landing", "date": "2018-11-25", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft will perform a final maneuver less than 24 hours before its scheduled landing to slightly adjust the location of its landing site. During a briefing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here Nov. 25, project leaders said they decided to carry out a sixth and final trajectory correction maneuver that is part of the cruise phase of the mission. Managers had suggested at a briefing Nov. 21 that, based on the accuracy of the trajectory at that time, they might skip that final maneuver. Tom Hoffman, project manager for InSight, said at the briefing that after the fifth TCM Nov. 18, the center of the landing ellipse, representing the region on the planet the spacecraft would land in, was off its target by about 18 kilometers. That difference was enough for him and other mission officials, at a meeting a few hours before the briefing, to decide to carry out the final maneuver. \"We want to avoid the area up here,\" he said, referring to a region with rougher terrain near the edge of the current landing ellipse. \"That's not a great area to land.\" That maneuver, known as TCM-6 and taking place about 22 hours before the 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 landing, will change the spacecraft's velocity by just a few centimeters per second. \"Hopefully within a few hours after that we're going to know exactly where we're landing,\" he said. \"Things should be in good shape.\" The maneuver, he said, is intended to move the center of the landing ellipse back to the target, marked on images with a red X, and avoid the undesirable terrain, a decision that came after what Hoffman called a \"very exciting\" meeting earlier in the day. \"We listened to all the different inputs and the final decision was to go ahead and do the TCM and move ourselves back to that red X,\" he said, \"and be exactly where we really want to land from both a safety standpoint as well as making sure we have the right location for our science instruments.\" Officials said that, other than the decision to perform the final maneuver, there are no issues with the spacecraft, formally known as Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The mission, with a total cost including international contributions of nearly $1 billion, is designed to study the composition and structure of the interior of Mars using a seismometer and heat flow probe. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy those two instruments over the next few months, collecting data on a prime mission scheduled to last two years. \"It feels like a climax,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight at JPL, of the landing, \"but it's actually the beginning.\" He and others involved with the mission expressed a mix of confidence that the spacecraft, based on the Phoenix Mars Lander that successfully landed on Mars a decade ago, would make to the surface, as well as nervousness as the landing approaches. \"I'm actually really confident, personally, that we're going to land safely tomorrow,\" Banerdt said. \"It doesn't mean I'm not nervous.\" \"We recognize that we never take Mars for granted,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science. \"Mars is hard.\" Hoffman noted he spent the Thanksgiving holiday with family, including three young grandsons who, when excited, run around and yell. \"Inside of me right now I'm just about the same,\" he said. As soon as he receives word of a successful landing, he said, \"I'm going to unleash my inner four-year-old.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/insight-to-perform-final-maneuver-before-landing/"}, {"title": "NASA InSight Lander Arrives on Martian Surface", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "Mars has just received its newest robotic resident. NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet after an almost seven-month, 300-million-mile journey from Earth. InSight's two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed. InSight launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5. The lander touched down Monday, Nov. 26, near Mars' equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia, at 11:52:59 a.m. PST. \"Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"InSight will study the interior of Mars and will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars. This accomplishment represents the ingenuity of America and our international partners, and it serves as a testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team. The best of NASA is yet to come, and it is coming soon.\" The landing signal was relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, via NASA's two small experimental Mars Cube One CubeSats, which launched on the same rocket as InSight and followed the lander to Mars. They are the first CubeSats sent into deep space. After successfully carrying out a number of communications and in-flight navigation experiments, the twin MarCOs were set in position to receive transmissions during InSight's entry, descent and landing. \"We hit the Martian atmosphere at 12,300 mph, and the whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes,\" said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"During that short span of time, InSight had to autonomously perform dozens of operations and do them flawlessly - and by all indications that is exactly what our spacecraft did.\" Confirmation of a successful touchdown is not the end of the challenges of landing on the Red Planet. InSight's surface-operations phase began a minute after touchdown. One of its first tasks is to deploy its two decagonal solar arrays, which will provide power. That process begins 16 minutes after landing and takes another 16 minutes to complete. The InSight team expects a confirmation later Monday that the spacecraft's solar panels successfully deployed. Verification will come from NASA's Odyssey spacecraft, currently orbiting Mars. That signal is expected to reach InSight's mission control at JPL about five-and-a-half hours after landing. \"We are solar powered, so getting the arrays out and operating is a big deal,\" said Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"With the arrays providing the energy we need to start the cool science operations, we are well on our way to thoroughly investigate what's inside of Mars for the very first time.\" InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight's instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight's 5.9-foot-long robotic arm so that it can take images of the landscape. \"Landing was thrilling, but I'm looking forward to the drilling,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"When the first images come down, our engineering and science teams will hit the ground running, beginning to plan where to deploy our science instruments. Within two or three months, the arm will deploy the mission's main science instruments, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure and Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instruments.\" InSight will operate on the surface for one Martian year, plus 40 Martian days, or sols, until Nov. 24, 2020. The mission objectives of the two small MarCOs which relayed InSight's telemetry was completed after their Martian flyby. \"That's one giant leap for our intrepid, briefcase-sized robotic explorers,\" said Joel Krajewski, MarCO project manager at JPL. \"I think CubeSats have a big future beyond Earth's orbit, and the MarCO team is happy to trailblaze the way.\" With InSight's landing at Elysium Planitia, NASA has successfully soft-landed a vehicle on the Red Planet eight times. \"Every Mars landing is daunting, but now with InSight safely on the surface we get to do a unique kind of science on Mars,\" said JPL director Michael Watkins. \"The experimental MarCO CubeSats have also opened a new door to smaller planetary spacecraft. The success of these two unique missions is a tribute to the hundreds of talented engineers and scientists who put their genius and labor into making this a great day.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8392/nasa-insight-lander-arrives-on-martian-surface/?site=insight"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight lander touches down on Mars after daring maneuver", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft landed on Mars Monday afternoon, finishing one journey -- through space -- and now launching on another: to go deeper into Mars.

The trip that started seven months and more than 300 million miles ago ended in an anxiety-filled but ultimately smooth last six minutes of entry, descent and landing onto the Martian surface. Jars of peanuts, a good luck token at JPL, were seen throughout the room. \"Flawless. This is what we hoped and imagined in our minds' eye. It looked like it was a very successful and perfect landing,\" Rob Manning, JPL's chief engineer, said minutes after the probe landed. \"The vehicle is nominal. It's happy. The lander is not complaining. We had a way to tell us if it was unhappy, and it wasn't,\" Manning said. It's a normal mode.\" InSight will open its solar panels after it waits for dust to literally clear about four hours after the lander guided itself onto Martian soil. The last several minutes were fraught with anxiety, as technicians braced for any possible scenario. For example, before the parachute deployed, portions of the heat shield became as hot as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We've studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,\" Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a press release. \"Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbor as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.\" InSight marks the first attempt since 2012 for an American spacecraft to visit the red planet. NASA scientists took nothing for granted.

Anxious teams of scientists and engineers, clustered together at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, knew the spacecraft had survived its wild and tricky descent to the red planet's surface after receiving data suggesting the lander had touched down safely-followed by an image from InSight itself showing a dusty, alien horizon with a single robot foot. \"It's nice and dirty; I like that,\" says Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"This image is actually a really good argument for why you put a dust cover on a camera. Good choice, right?\" After successfully unfurling its solar panels a few hours later, the spacecraft officially became the newest member in an elite fleet of interplanetary robots currently exploring the red planet-including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which monitored InSight's descent. \"I'm very, very happy that it looks like we have an incredibly safe and boring-looking landing plain. That's exactly what we were going for-it's what the landing site selection people promised me,\" says JPL's Tom Hoffman, the InSight project manager. \"They promised me sandy with no rocks. But there's one rock, so I might have to talk with them about that.\" InSight's journey of more than 300 million miles began on May 5 with a foggy, early morning launch from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. Tucked inside its shell, the spacecraft rocketed through the solar system, navigating by starlight as an onboard star tracker helped it stay on course. On November 25 -and then once more, a few hours before touchdown-the spacecraft's entry, descent, and landing team nudged it onto a trajectory that would allow it to bulls-eye in Elysium Planitia. This flat, unremarkable plain was chosen specifically because of the relatively abundant sunlight at the equator and its geologic boringness at the surface, which offers the best chance of finding ideal places to set down its instruments. Once its plunge through the atmosphere was set, the team could only sit back and watch: Without guided entry, InSight had to fly itself to the Martian surface, meaning that a safe landing relied upon correct, preprogrammed commands and on all the necessary onboard instruments functioning properly. \"There are certainly points that will make me smile if they go well,\" Julie Wertz-Chen, an entry, descent, and landing team member, said the week before. As InSight made contact with the planet's thin air, a heat shield protected it from burning up while it whizzed along at 12,300 miles an hour. About a minute later, the spacecraft deployed a parachute that put on a hefty brake and eventually slowed it to 134 miles an hour. Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator on the InSight lander, stands near a replica of InSight used to simulate the landing weeks ahead of the actual touchdown. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Its heat shield then popped off, and an on-board radar began to search for and ultimately lock onto the ground. At 3,280 feet up, InSight ditched its parachute, performed a short free fall, and then fired a dozen descent engines to eventually slow it to a mere five miles an hour. From atmospheric contact to setting robot legs on the ground, the process took just 6 minutes and 45 seconds. \"It was an incredibly emotional experience,\" Hoffman recounts. \"To get to the point where you have seven more minutes to survive, literally survive, is incredibly hard to describe. My heart ... just stopped beating for seven minutes.\" InSight wasn't the only robot entering Martian airspace for the first time today. Two mini-spacecraft, each about the size of a briefcase, were tagging along as part of the first mission to send tiny spacecraft known as CubeSats into interplanetary space. Collectively known as Mars Cube One, but separately referred to as MarCO-A and MarCO-B, their mission was to collect information from InSight as it descended to the surface, and then relay that information to mission control at JPL. They succeeded not only in doing that, but also in sending back a stark, evocative image of Mars as they departed. \"This is a fantastic day for spacecraft, great and small,\" says JPL's Andrew Klesh. \"This team of really mostly part-timers has proven the technology that we were trying to demonstrate with this mission.\" Now that its solar panels are set up, it's time for InSight to get to work. Over the course of one Martian year, it will do something a bit different from most other Mars missions, which have focused on the planet's flashy rift valleys, mammoth volcanoes, or signs of ancient running water on the surface. Instead, this mission aims to get at the heart of Mars, to measure the size of the planet's core and other interior layers. To do this, it will rely on marsquakes -or tremors that are often produced by the same tectonic activity that crafts those beautiful mountains and valleys. One of InSight's primary goals is to figure out how seismically active Mars is, says Renee Weber of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. How NASA's next Mars mission will take the red planet's pulse \"That is something that we don't actually know,\" she says. \"That's basically how many quakes there are, how often they occur, where do they occur, how big they are.\" Weber suspects that Mars will lie somewhere between Earth and moon in terms of tectonic activity. Parked on the surface, InSight is just waiting to snare those signals. Over the next couple months, it will deploy its instruments, including an exquisitely sensitive seismometer that should detect a variety of marsquakes, both those produced by the planet's own spasms and those resulting from meteor impacts. \"To get all the instruments on the ground is expected to take approximately two to three months,\" says JPL's Elizabeth Barrett. \"I liken it to playing that claw game at a carnival, but you're doing it with a really, really valuable prize, and you're doing it blindfolded where you can only take occasional pictures, and then you're doing it via remote control on another planet.\" After the spacecraft determines the location of a marsquake, it will read the incoming seismic waves and use the information they carry to figure out what types of rock they moved through. As marsquakes rock the planet's innards, they send seismic waves bouncing through the interior, signals that travel just a tiny bit differently depending on what kind of material they're moving through.

Shooting through space at speeds of 6,200 miles per hour (10,000 km/h), the InSight mission is expected to land on Mars on November 26. Since launch and until that moment, the spacecraft has been and will be monitored by the space agency almost continuously, including with the help of a pair of mini-satellites from the CubeSat family. Since its launch from Earth in May, InSight's trajectory has been corrected a few times. The first and the biggest such trajectory correction maneuvers took place on May 22 and required the thrusters to be fired for about 40 seconds. The use of the thrusters had an impact on velocity measured at 3.8 meters per second (8.5 mph). Until the time it lands, NASA said an additional five or six such maneuvers might need to be performed. Although there is only half the distance left to cover, NASA will not land the spacecraft on Mars until November 26 because it will require additional time for preparation for entry, descent, landing and surface operation. InSight is an acronym for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The lander is meant to study Mars' deep interior using seismology and other geophysical measurements. The instrument platform was built back in 2010 and was initially planned to travel to Mars in 2016. Because of a failure to one of the instruments, the launch was canceled. As for the two satellites accompanying the mission, they will be used to track and follow the lander through space, with their ultimate task being their recording of the spacecraft's entry in the Martian atmosphere. The survival of the two CubeSats in deep space might also mean similar satellites could be sent towards other destinations as well, or maybe accompanying other missions.

All of its instruments have been tested and are working well. As of 20 August, the spacecraft had covered 172 million miles since its launch 107 days ago. In another 98 days, it will travel another 129 million miles and touch down in Mars' Elysium Planitia region, where it will be the first mission to study the Red Planet's deep interior. InSight stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The InSight team is using the time before the spacecraft's arrival at Mars to not only plan and practice for that critical day, but also to activate and check spacecraft subsystems vital to cruise, landing and surface operations, including the highly sensitive science instruments. InSight's seismometer, which will be used to detect quakes on Mars, received a clean bill of health on 19 July. The SEIS instrument is a six-sensor seismometer combining two types of sensors to measure ground motions over a wide range of frequencies. It will give scientists a window into Mars' internal activity. \"We did our final performance checks on July 19, which were successful,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. The team also checked an instrument that will measure the amount of heat escaping from Mars. After being placed on the surface, InSight's Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument will use a self-hammering mechanical mole burrowing to a depth of 10 to 16 feet. Measurements by sensors on the mole and on a science tether from the mole to the surface will yield the first precise determination of the amount of heat escaping from the planet's interior. The checkout consisted of powering on the main electronics for the instrument, performing checks of its instrument sensor elements, exercising some of the instrument's internal heaters, and reading out the stored settings in the electronics module. The third of InSight's three main investigations - Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment - uses the spacecraft's radio connection with Earth to assess perturbations of Mars' rotation axis. These measurements can provide information about the planet's core. \"We have been using the spacecraft's radio since launch day, and our conversations with InSight have been very cordial, so we are good to go with RISE as well,\" said Banerdt. The lander's cameras checked out fine as well, taking a spacecraft selfie of the inside of the spacecraft's backshell. InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman from JPL said that, \"If you are an engineer on InSight, that first glimpse of the heat shield blanket, harness tie-downs and cover bolts is a very reassuring sight as it tells us our Instrument Context Camera is operating perfectly. The next picture we plan to take with this camera will be of the surface of Mars.\" If all goes as planned, the camera will take the first image of Elysium Planitia minutes after InSight touches down on Mars.

Scientists and project managers, speaking at a pair of briefings Nov. 21 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said there are no issues with the spacecraft, which is on course for a landing at approximately 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars just north of the planet's equator. Rob Grover, the entry, descent and landing lead for the mission, said that since the latest trajectory correction maneuver by the spacecraft Nov. 18, the spacecraft appears to be within about seven kilometers of the planned landing site. \"We're very close right now,\" he said. \"We may not need our last course correction maneuver.\" He said the project will decide by the end of the day Nov. 23 whether that maneuver, which would take place Nov. 25, is needed. Conditions at the landing site appear to be ideal for landing, he noted. The global dust storm that swept across the planet in June, shutting off contact with the Opportunity Mars rover, has long since faded, and there's been no signs of storms in the vicinity of the landing site. \"We're expecting a very plain day on Mars for the landing, and we're very happy about that,\" he said. The Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft will slow down from 5.5 kilometers per second at the beginning of the EDL phase, about 125 kilometers high, to zero in 6.5 minutes, using a combination of a heat shield, parachute and thrusters. The spacecraft will deploy its solar arrays starting 16 minutes after landing, a delay intended to allow dust kicked up by the landing to settle, with the deployment itself taking an additional 16 minutes. NASA hopes to get realtime telemetry of the landing from a pair of cubesats, called Mars Cube One, that launched as secondary payloads with InSight in May and will fly past Mars during the landing. The MarCO cubesats, intended primarily as technology demonstrations, will be able to relay the telemetry from InSight and broadcast it back to Earth. In addition, InSight itself will broadcast a \"beep\" about seven minutes after landing, a signal indicating that it is on the surface. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will be able to provide data with a brief delay, including a first image from the surface taken by the lander. Confirmation that the lander's solar panels are deployed, though, won't come until about five and a half hours after landing, after an overhead pass from the Mars Odyssey orbiter. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy its two major instruments, a French-built seismometer and a German-built heat probe that will burrow several meters into the surface. Project scientists said that process, including scouting the best locations on the ground by the lander to place the instruments, will take several months. \"InSight is kind of a laid-back, slow-motion mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for InSight at JPL. \"It's going to take us probably two to three months, at least, to get our instruments down.\" He estimated it would be \"early next spring\" before those principal instruments started returning data. One of those instruments, the seismometer, suffered development problems that forced the French space agency CNES to redesign it, pushing back InSight's launch from March 2016 to this May. \"At the beginning it was just impossible to build,\" said Philippe Lognonne, project manager for the instrument at CNES. \"But we did it with the help of our partners.\" With those instruments in place, scientists hope to learn more about the interior of Mars and compare it with other terrestrial planets, including the Earth. \"The number one question we want to answer is what's the structure and the energetics of the interior of Mars,\" Banerdt said. That includes the size and density of the planet's core, the thickness of the planet's crust and the structure of the mantle. \"I've personally have been waiting for this information for decades,\" said Sue Smrekar, deputy principal investigator for InSight at JPL, \"and I'm super excited to get this lander on the ground and start taking this data.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-prepares-for-insight-mars-landing/"}, {"title": "InSight to perform final maneuver before landing", "date": "2018-11-25", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft will perform a final maneuver less than 24 hours before its scheduled landing to slightly adjust the location of its landing site. During a briefing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here Nov. 25, project leaders said they decided to carry out a sixth and final trajectory correction maneuver that is part of the cruise phase of the mission. Managers had suggested at a briefing Nov. 21 that, based on the accuracy of the trajectory at that time, they might skip that final maneuver. Tom Hoffman, project manager for InSight, said at the briefing that after the fifth TCM Nov. 18, the center of the landing ellipse, representing the region on the planet the spacecraft would land in, was off its target by about 18 kilometers. That difference was enough for him and other mission officials, at a meeting a few hours before the briefing, to decide to carry out the final maneuver. \"We want to avoid the area up here,\" he said, referring to a region with rougher terrain near the edge of the current landing ellipse. \"That's not a great area to land.\" That maneuver, known as TCM-6 and taking place about 22 hours before the 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 landing, will change the spacecraft's velocity by just a few centimeters per second. \"Hopefully within a few hours after that we're going to know exactly where we're landing,\" he said. \"Things should be in good shape.\" The maneuver, he said, is intended to move the center of the landing ellipse back to the target, marked on images with a red X, and avoid the undesirable terrain, a decision that came after what Hoffman called a \"very exciting\" meeting earlier in the day. \"We listened to all the different inputs and the final decision was to go ahead and do the TCM and move ourselves back to that red X,\" he said, \"and be exactly where we really want to land from both a safety standpoint as well as making sure we have the right location for our science instruments.\" Officials said that, other than the decision to perform the final maneuver, there are no issues with the spacecraft, formally known as Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The mission, with a total cost including international contributions of nearly $1 billion, is designed to study the composition and structure of the interior of Mars using a seismometer and heat flow probe. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy those two instruments over the next few months, collecting data on a prime mission scheduled to last two years. \"It feels like a climax,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight at JPL, of the landing, \"but it's actually the beginning.\" He and others involved with the mission expressed a mix of confidence that the spacecraft, based on the Phoenix Mars Lander that successfully landed on Mars a decade ago, would make to the surface, as well as nervousness as the landing approaches. \"I'm actually really confident, personally, that we're going to land safely tomorrow,\" Banerdt said. \"It doesn't mean I'm not nervous.\" \"We recognize that we never take Mars for granted,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science. \"Mars is hard.\" Hoffman noted he spent the Thanksgiving holiday with family, including three young grandsons who, when excited, run around and yell. \"Inside of me right now I'm just about the same,\" he said. As soon as he receives word of a successful landing, he said, \"I'm going to unleash my inner four-year-old.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/insight-to-perform-final-maneuver-before-landing/"}, {"title": "NASA InSight Lander Arrives on Martian Surface", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "Mars has just received its newest robotic resident. NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet after an almost seven-month, 300-million-mile journey from Earth. InSight's two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed. InSight launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5. The lander touched down Monday, Nov. 26, near Mars' equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia, at 11:52:59 a.m. PST. \"Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"InSight will study the interior of Mars and will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars. This accomplishment represents the ingenuity of America and our international partners, and it serves as a testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team. The best of NASA is yet to come, and it is coming soon.\" The landing signal was relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, via NASA's two small experimental Mars Cube One CubeSats, which launched on the same rocket as InSight and followed the lander to Mars. They are the first CubeSats sent into deep space. After successfully carrying out a number of communications and in-flight navigation experiments, the twin MarCOs were set in position to receive transmissions during InSight's entry, descent and landing. \"We hit the Martian atmosphere at 12,300 mph, and the whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes,\" said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"During that short span of time, InSight had to autonomously perform dozens of operations and do them flawlessly - and by all indications that is exactly what our spacecraft did.\" Confirmation of a successful touchdown is not the end of the challenges of landing on the Red Planet. InSight's surface-operations phase began a minute after touchdown. One of its first tasks is to deploy its two decagonal solar arrays, which will provide power. That process begins 16 minutes after landing and takes another 16 minutes to complete. The InSight team expects a confirmation later Monday that the spacecraft's solar panels successfully deployed. Verification will come from NASA's Odyssey spacecraft, currently orbiting Mars. That signal is expected to reach InSight's mission control at JPL about five-and-a-half hours after landing. \"We are solar powered, so getting the arrays out and operating is a big deal,\" said Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"With the arrays providing the energy we need to start the cool science operations, we are well on our way to thoroughly investigate what's inside of Mars for the very first time.\" InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight's instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight's 5.9-foot-long robotic arm so that it can take images of the landscape. \"Landing was thrilling, but I'm looking forward to the drilling,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"When the first images come down, our engineering and science teams will hit the ground running, beginning to plan where to deploy our science instruments. Within two or three months, the arm will deploy the mission's main science instruments, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure and Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instruments.\" InSight will operate on the surface for one Martian year, plus 40 Martian days, or sols, until Nov. 24, 2020. The mission objectives of the two small MarCOs which relayed InSight's telemetry was completed after their Martian flyby. \"That's one giant leap for our intrepid, briefcase-sized robotic explorers,\" said Joel Krajewski, MarCO project manager at JPL. \"I think CubeSats have a big future beyond Earth's orbit, and the MarCO team is happy to trailblaze the way.\" With InSight's landing at Elysium Planitia, NASA has successfully soft-landed a vehicle on the Red Planet eight times. \"Every Mars landing is daunting, but now with InSight safely on the surface we get to do a unique kind of science on Mars,\" said JPL director Michael Watkins. \"The experimental MarCO CubeSats have also opened a new door to smaller planetary spacecraft. The success of these two unique missions is a tribute to the hundreds of talented engineers and scientists who put their genius and labor into making this a great day.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8392/nasa-insight-lander-arrives-on-martian-surface/?site=insight"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight lander touches down on Mars after daring maneuver", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft landed on Mars Monday afternoon, finishing one journey -- through space -- and now launching on another: to go deeper into Mars.

It was celebratory with every new information we received,\" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said on a NASA livestream. He said he received a call on his cellphone from a number that was \"all zeroes\" seconds after the landing. It was Vice President Mike Pence. \"He watched the whole thing. He is absolutely ecstatic about our program,\" Bridenstine said. \"He wants me to say congratulations to everyone here at NASA and all of our international partners.\" Pence is chairman of the National Space Council and promotes President Trump's \"Space Force\" plan for a branch of the military in outer space. Dressed in maroon button-down shirts, scientists and engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, could be seen cheering, clapping and hugging after the daring landing. The trip that started seven months and more than 300 million miles ago ended in an anxiety-filled but ultimately smooth last six minutes of entry, descent and landing onto the Martian surface. Jars of peanuts, a good luck token at JPL, were seen throughout the room. \"Flawless. This is what we hoped and imagined in our minds' eye. It looked like it was a very successful and perfect landing,\" Rob Manning, JPL's chief engineer, said minutes after the probe landed. \"The vehicle is nominal. It's happy. The lander is not complaining. We had a way to tell us if it was unhappy, and it wasn't,\" Manning said. It's a normal mode.\" InSight will open its solar panels after it waits for dust to literally clear about four hours after the lander guided itself onto Martian soil. The last several minutes were fraught with anxiety, as technicians braced for any possible scenario. For example, before the parachute deployed, portions of the heat shield became as hot as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We've studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,\" Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a press release. \"Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbor as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.\" InSight marks the first attempt since 2012 for an American spacecraft to visit the red planet. NASA scientists took nothing for granted. On Sunday at 4:47 p.m. ET, engineers were still correcting course \"to steer the spacecraft within a few kilometers of its targeted entry point over Mars,\" NASA said. The monitoring and adjustments to InSight's path continued until the last minute. \"It's taken more than a decade to bring InSight from a concept to a spacecraft approaching Mars - and even longer since I was first inspired to try to undertake this kind of mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"But even after landing, we'll need to be patient for the science to begin.\" ", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/nasas-insight-lander-touch-mars/story?id=59417560"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight Mars lander has touched down.

From atmospheric contact to setting robot legs on the ground, the process took just 6 minutes and 45 seconds. \"It was an incredibly emotional experience,\" Hoffman recounts. \"To get to the point where you have seven more minutes to survive, literally survive, is incredibly hard to describe.

But one \"unplanned treat\" is a recording of the wind rolling across the Martian plains - which you can listen to right here. Technically the lander isn't rigged to detect sound, at least in the way you'd do it if you were deliberately trying to record it. But the robotic platform's air pressure sensor and seismometer are both capable of detecting the minute variations as the wind rolls over it. The air pressure sensor, inside that silver dome you see above, produced the most normal-sounding signal, though it still had to be adjusted considerably to be like what you'd hear if you were there. \"The InSight lander acts like a giant ear,\" explained InSight science team member Tom Pike in a NASA news release. \"The solar panels on the lander's sides respond to pressure fluctuations of the wind. It's like InSight is cupping its ears and hearing the Mars wind beating on it.\" Sounds a lot like regular wind, right? Well, what were you expecting? Like so many aspects of space exploration, the prosaic nature of the thing itself - a rock, a landscape feature, a breath of wind - is offset by the fact that it's occurring millions of miles away on an alien world and relayed here by a high- tech robot. Wind on Mars might not sound much different than wind on Earth - but surely that's not the point! If you're curious, the air movement in the recording is a northwesterly one, \"consistent with the direction of dust devil streaks\" in the area. Good to know we can rely on InSight's \"ears\" for that purpose, though its science target is below the surface, not skimming above it. We'll have more recordings soon, I'm sure, so you can use it as noise to fall asleep to. But even better sounds are forthcoming: the Mars 2020 rover will have actual high-quality microphones on board, and will record the sounds of its landing as well as the Martian ambience.

The spacecraft used a camera on its robotic arm to take its first selfie - a mosaic made up of 11 images. This is the same imaging process used by NASA's Curiosity rover mission, in which many overlapping pictures are taken and later stitched together. Visible in the selfie are the lander's solar panel and its entire deck, including its science instruments. Mission team members have also received their first complete look at InSight's \"workspace\" - the approximately 14-by-7-foot crescent of terrain directly in front of the spacecraft. This image is also a mosaic composed of 52 individual photos. In the coming weeks, scientists and engineers will go through the painstaking process of deciding where in this workspace the spacecraft's instruments should be placed. They will then command InSight's robotic arm to carefully set the seismometer and heat-flow probe in the chosen locations. Both work best on level ground, and engineers want to avoid setting them on rocks larger than about a half-inch. \"The near-absence of rocks, hills and holes means it'll be extremely safe for our instruments,\" said InSight's Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren't on Mars, but we're glad to see that.\" InSight's landing team deliberately chose a landing region in Elysium Planitia that is relatively free of rocks. Even so, the landing spot turned out even better than they hoped. The spacecraft sits in what appears to be a nearly rock-free \"hollow\" - a depression created by a meteor impact that later filled with sand.

New images from the lander show the seismometer on the ground, its copper-colored covering faintly illuminated in the Martian dusk. It looks as if all is calm and all is bright for InSight, heading into the end of the year. \"InSight's timetable of activities on Mars has gone better than we hoped,\" said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman, who is based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Getting the seismometer safely on the ground is an awesome Christmas present.\" The InSight team has been working carefully toward deploying its two dedicated science instruments onto Martian soil since landing on Mars on Nov. 26. Meanwhile, the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, which does not have its own separate instrument, has already begun using InSight's radio connection with Earth to collect preliminary data on the planet's core. Not enough time has elapsed for scientists to deduce what they want to know - scientists estimate they might have some results starting in about a year. To deploy the seismometer and the heat probe, engineers first had to verify the robotic arm that picks up and places InSight's instruments onto the Martian surface was working properly. Engineers tested the commands for the lander, making sure a model in the test bed at JPL deployed the instruments exactly as intended. Scientists also had to analyze images of the Martian terrain around the lander to figure out the best places to deploy the instruments. On Tuesday, Dec. 18, InSight engineers sent up the commands to the spacecraft. On Wednesday, Dec. 19, the seismometer was gently placed onto the ground directly in front of the lander, about as far away as the arm can reach -- 5.367 feet, or 1.636 meters, away. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\" The seismometer allows scientists to peer into the Martian interior by studying ground motion - also known as marsquakes. Each marsquake acts as a kind of flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet's interior. By analyzing how seismic waves pass through the layers of the planet, scientists can deduce the depth and composition of these layers. \"Having the seismometer on the ground is like holding a phone up to your ear,\" said Philippe Lognonn\u00e9, principal investigator of SEIS from Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Paris Diderot University. \"We're thrilled that we're now in the best position to listen to all the seismic waves from below Mars' surface and from its deep interior.\" In the coming days, the InSight team will work on leveling the seismometer, which is sitting on ground that is tilted 2 to 3 degrees. The first seismometer science data should begin to flow back to Earth after the seismometer is in the right position. But engineers and scientists at JPL, the French national space agency Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales and other institutions affiliated with the SEIS team will need several additional weeks to make sure the returned data are as clear as possible. For one thing, they will check and possibly adjust the seismometer's long, wire-lined tether to minimize noise that could travel along it to the seismometer. Then, in early January, engineers expect to command the robotic arm to place the Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer to stabilize the environment around the sensors. Assuming that there are no unexpected issues, the InSight team plans to deploy the heat probe onto the Martian surface by late January. HP3 will be on the east side of the lander's work space, roughly the same distance away from the lander as the seismometer. For now, though, the team is focusing on getting those first bits of seismic data back from the Martian surface. \"We look forward to popping some Champagne when we start to get data from InSight's seismometer on the ground,\" Banerdt added. \"I have a bottle ready for the occasion.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8402/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars/?site=insight"}, {"title": "InSight team creates Martian rock garden, lander begins work", "date": "2018-12-22", "content": "Using tools ranging from rakes and shovels to augmented reality headsets, engineers with NASA's Mars InSight mission have built a Martian rock garden which recreates the lander's new home on Mars. This allows engineers to practice placing science instrument on the surface using InSight's Earth-bound twin - ForeSight. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory built the rock garden based on photos taken by InSight's cameras. The team used rakes and shovels to shape a bed of gravel-like material called garnet, which is used to simulate Martian sand. These Earth-based explorers were able to match the conditions at InSight's landing sight by wearing Microsoft Hololens-augmented reality headsets which projected digital terrain models of the landing site on to the test bed. The perimeter of the area where the two science instruments would be place was marked with wooden blocks and precision cameras in the lab were used to measure each feature they intended to replicate. Building the rock garden, which mimics every detail down to pebbles or rocks larger than one inch took about four hours. Fortunately, a mosaic image of the lander's workspace released last week shows that the area is smooth and mostly rock-free. \"It's great for the science we want to do,\" said JPL's Marleen Sundgaard, who is guiding the test-bed work. \"It's the flat parking lot the landing team promised us. You calculate the probability of rocks in the area and hope the odds are in your favor.\" NASA sent the commands for InSight to set down its seismometer to Mars on Tuesday, Dec. 18. In a few days, Sundgaard and her colleagues will be waiting to see the first images of their work being replicated on Mars. The latest addition to NASA's family of Martian explorers has been as busy as the crew managing it back on the ground has been. The 794 lbs lander was ordered to place the seismometer on Tuesday, Dec. 18, which it completed on the following day right in front of it. Given that the vehicle is stationary it can only move / place things within the length of its arm. With this instrument in place scientists back on Earth should be able to gain a better understanding the \"goings-on\" inside the Red Planet by listening to how the planet moves. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\"", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-centers/jet-propulsion-laboratory/insight-team-creates-martian-rock-garden-lander-begins-work/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA InSight Lander Now Half Way to Mars", "date": "2018-08-07", "content": "Of the 300 million miles it has to cover before reaching the deserted sands of Mars, NASA's InSight lander has already traveled half, the space agency said earlier this week. Shooting through space at speeds of 6,200 miles per hour (10,000 km/h), the InSight mission is expected to land on Mars on November 26. Since launch and until that moment, the spacecraft has been and will be monitored by the space agency almost continuously, including with the help of a pair of mini-satellites from the CubeSat family. Since its launch from Earth in May, InSight's trajectory has been corrected a few times. The first and the biggest such trajectory correction maneuvers took place on May 22 and required the thrusters to be fired for about 40 seconds. The use of the thrusters had an impact on velocity measured at 3.8 meters per second (8.5 mph). Until the time it lands, NASA said an additional five or six such maneuvers might need to be performed. Although there is only half the distance left to cover, NASA will not land the spacecraft on Mars until November 26 because it will require additional time for preparation for entry, descent, landing and surface operation. InSight is an acronym for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The lander is meant to study Mars' deep interior using seismology and other geophysical measurements. The instrument platform was built back in 2010 and was initially planned to travel to Mars in 2016. Because of a failure to one of the instruments, the launch was canceled. As for the two satellites accompanying the mission, they will be used to track and follow the lander through space, with their ultimate task being their recording of the spacecraft's entry in the Martian atmosphere. The survival of the two CubeSats in deep space might also mean similar satellites could be sent towards other destinations as well, or maybe accompanying other missions.

All of its instruments have been tested and are working well. As of 20 August, the spacecraft had covered 172 million miles since its launch 107 days ago. In another 98 days, it will travel another 129 million miles and touch down in Mars' Elysium Planitia region, where it will be the first mission to study the Red Planet's deep interior. InSight stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The InSight team is using the time before the spacecraft's arrival at Mars to not only plan and practice for that critical day, but also to activate and check spacecraft subsystems vital to cruise, landing and surface operations, including the highly sensitive science instruments. InSight's seismometer, which will be used to detect quakes on Mars, received a clean bill of health on 19 July. The SEIS instrument is a six-sensor seismometer combining two types of sensors to measure ground motions over a wide range of frequencies. It will give scientists a window into Mars' internal activity. \"We did our final performance checks on July 19, which were successful,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. The team also checked an instrument that will measure the amount of heat escaping from Mars. After being placed on the surface, InSight's Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument will use a self-hammering mechanical mole burrowing to a depth of 10 to 16 feet. Measurements by sensors on the mole and on a science tether from the mole to the surface will yield the first precise determination of the amount of heat escaping from the planet's interior. The checkout consisted of powering on the main electronics for the instrument, performing checks of its instrument sensor elements, exercising some of the instrument's internal heaters, and reading out the stored settings in the electronics module. The third of InSight's three main investigations - Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment - uses the spacecraft's radio connection with Earth to assess perturbations of Mars' rotation axis. These measurements can provide information about the planet's core. \"We have been using the spacecraft's radio since launch day, and our conversations with InSight have been very cordial, so we are good to go with RISE as well,\" said Banerdt. The lander's cameras checked out fine as well, taking a spacecraft selfie of the inside of the spacecraft's backshell. InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman from JPL said that, \"If you are an engineer on InSight, that first glimpse of the heat shield blanket, harness tie-downs and cover bolts is a very reassuring sight as it tells us our Instrument Context Camera is operating perfectly. The next picture we plan to take with this camera will be of the surface of Mars.\" If all goes as planned, the camera will take the first image of Elysium Planitia minutes after InSight touches down on Mars.

Scientists and project managers, speaking at a pair of briefings Nov. 21 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said there are no issues with the spacecraft, which is on course for a landing at approximately 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars just north of the planet's equator. Rob Grover, the entry, descent and landing lead for the mission, said that since the latest trajectory correction maneuver by the spacecraft Nov. 18, the spacecraft appears to be within about seven kilometers of the planned landing site. \"We're very close right now,\" he said. \"We may not need our last course correction maneuver.\" He said the project will decide by the end of the day Nov. 23 whether that maneuver, which would take place Nov. 25, is needed. Conditions at the landing site appear to be ideal for landing, he noted. The global dust storm that swept across the planet in June, shutting off contact with the Opportunity Mars rover, has long since faded, and there's been no signs of storms in the vicinity of the landing site. \"We're expecting a very plain day on Mars for the landing, and we're very happy about that,\" he said. The Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft will slow down from 5.5 kilometers per second at the beginning of the EDL phase, about 125 kilometers high, to zero in 6.5 minutes, using a combination of a heat shield, parachute and thrusters. The spacecraft will deploy its solar arrays starting 16 minutes after landing, a delay intended to allow dust kicked up by the landing to settle, with the deployment itself taking an additional 16 minutes. NASA hopes to get realtime telemetry of the landing from a pair of cubesats, called Mars Cube One, that launched as secondary payloads with InSight in May and will fly past Mars during the landing. The MarCO cubesats, intended primarily as technology demonstrations, will be able to relay the telemetry from InSight and broadcast it back to Earth. In addition, InSight itself will broadcast a \"beep\" about seven minutes after landing, a signal indicating that it is on the surface. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will be able to provide data with a brief delay, including a first image from the surface taken by the lander. Confirmation that the lander's solar panels are deployed, though, won't come until about five and a half hours after landing, after an overhead pass from the Mars Odyssey orbiter. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy its two major instruments, a French-built seismometer and a German-built heat probe that will burrow several meters into the surface. Project scientists said that process, including scouting the best locations on the ground by the lander to place the instruments, will take several months. \"InSight is kind of a laid-back, slow-motion mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for InSight at JPL. \"It's going to take us probably two to three months, at least, to get our instruments down.\" He estimated it would be \"early next spring\" before those principal instruments started returning data. One of those instruments, the seismometer, suffered development problems that forced the French space agency CNES to redesign it, pushing back InSight's launch from March 2016 to this May. \"At the beginning it was just impossible to build,\" said Philippe Lognonne, project manager for the instrument at CNES. \"But we did it with the help of our partners.\" With those instruments in place, scientists hope to learn more about the interior of Mars and compare it with other terrestrial planets, including the Earth. \"The number one question we want to answer is what's the structure and the energetics of the interior of Mars,\" Banerdt said. That includes the size and density of the planet's core, the thickness of the planet's crust and the structure of the mantle. \"I've personally have been waiting for this information for decades,\" said Sue Smrekar, deputy principal investigator for InSight at JPL, \"and I'm super excited to get this lander on the ground and start taking this data.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-prepares-for-insight-mars-landing/"}, {"title": "InSight to perform final maneuver before landing", "date": "2018-11-25", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft will perform a final maneuver less than 24 hours before its scheduled landing to slightly adjust the location of its landing site. During a briefing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here Nov. 25, project leaders said they decided to carry out a sixth and final trajectory correction maneuver that is part of the cruise phase of the mission. Managers had suggested at a briefing Nov. 21 that, based on the accuracy of the trajectory at that time, they might skip that final maneuver. Tom Hoffman, project manager for InSight, said at the briefing that after the fifth TCM Nov. 18, the center of the landing ellipse, representing the region on the planet the spacecraft would land in, was off its target by about 18 kilometers. That difference was enough for him and other mission officials, at a meeting a few hours before the briefing, to decide to carry out the final maneuver. \"We want to avoid the area up here,\" he said, referring to a region with rougher terrain near the edge of the current landing ellipse. \"That's not a great area to land.\" That maneuver, known as TCM-6 and taking place about 22 hours before the 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 landing, will change the spacecraft's velocity by just a few centimeters per second. \"Hopefully within a few hours after that we're going to know exactly where we're landing,\" he said. \"Things should be in good shape.\" The maneuver, he said, is intended to move the center of the landing ellipse back to the target, marked on images with a red X, and avoid the undesirable terrain, a decision that came after what Hoffman called a \"very exciting\" meeting earlier in the day. \"We listened to all the different inputs and the final decision was to go ahead and do the TCM and move ourselves back to that red X,\" he said, \"and be exactly where we really want to land from both a safety standpoint as well as making sure we have the right location for our science instruments.\" Officials said that, other than the decision to perform the final maneuver, there are no issues with the spacecraft, formally known as Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The mission, with a total cost including international contributions of nearly $1 billion, is designed to study the composition and structure of the interior of Mars using a seismometer and heat flow probe. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy those two instruments over the next few months, collecting data on a prime mission scheduled to last two years. \"It feels like a climax,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight at JPL, of the landing, \"but it's actually the beginning.\" He and others involved with the mission expressed a mix of confidence that the spacecraft, based on the Phoenix Mars Lander that successfully landed on Mars a decade ago, would make to the surface, as well as nervousness as the landing approaches. \"I'm actually really confident, personally, that we're going to land safely tomorrow,\" Banerdt said. \"It doesn't mean I'm not nervous.\" \"We recognize that we never take Mars for granted,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science. \"Mars is hard.\" Hoffman noted he spent the Thanksgiving holiday with family, including three young grandsons who, when excited, run around and yell. \"Inside of me right now I'm just about the same,\" he said. As soon as he receives word of a successful landing, he said, \"I'm going to unleash my inner four-year-old.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/insight-to-perform-final-maneuver-before-landing/"}, {"title": "NASA InSight Lander Arrives on Martian Surface", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "Mars has just received its newest robotic resident. NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet after an almost seven-month, 300-million-mile journey from Earth. InSight's two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed. InSight launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5. The lander touched down Monday, Nov. 26, near Mars' equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia, at 11:52:59 a.m. PST. \"Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"InSight will study the interior of Mars and will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars. This accomplishment represents the ingenuity of America and our international partners, and it serves as a testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team. The best of NASA is yet to come, and it is coming soon.\" The landing signal was relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, via NASA's two small experimental Mars Cube One CubeSats, which launched on the same rocket as InSight and followed the lander to Mars. They are the first CubeSats sent into deep space. After successfully carrying out a number of communications and in-flight navigation experiments, the twin MarCOs were set in position to receive transmissions during InSight's entry, descent and landing. \"We hit the Martian atmosphere at 12,300 mph, and the whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes,\" said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"During that short span of time, InSight had to autonomously perform dozens of operations and do them flawlessly - and by all indications that is exactly what our spacecraft did.\" Confirmation of a successful touchdown is not the end of the challenges of landing on the Red Planet. InSight's surface-operations phase began a minute after touchdown. One of its first tasks is to deploy its two decagonal solar arrays, which will provide power. That process begins 16 minutes after landing and takes another 16 minutes to complete. The InSight team expects a confirmation later Monday that the spacecraft's solar panels successfully deployed. Verification will come from NASA's Odyssey spacecraft, currently orbiting Mars. That signal is expected to reach InSight's mission control at JPL about five-and-a-half hours after landing. \"We are solar powered, so getting the arrays out and operating is a big deal,\" said Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"With the arrays providing the energy we need to start the cool science operations, we are well on our way to thoroughly investigate what's inside of Mars for the very first time.\" InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight's instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight's 5.9-foot-long robotic arm so that it can take images of the landscape. \"Landing was thrilling, but I'm looking forward to the drilling,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"When the first images come down, our engineering and science teams will hit the ground running, beginning to plan where to deploy our science instruments. Within two or three months, the arm will deploy the mission's main science instruments, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure and Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instruments.\" InSight will operate on the surface for one Martian year, plus 40 Martian days, or sols, until Nov. 24, 2020. The mission objectives of the two small MarCOs which relayed InSight's telemetry was completed after their Martian flyby. \"That's one giant leap for our intrepid, briefcase-sized robotic explorers,\" said Joel Krajewski, MarCO project manager at JPL. \"I think CubeSats have a big future beyond Earth's orbit, and the MarCO team is happy to trailblaze the way.\" With InSight's landing at Elysium Planitia, NASA has successfully soft-landed a vehicle on the Red Planet eight times. \"Every Mars landing is daunting, but now with InSight safely on the surface we get to do a unique kind of science on Mars,\" said JPL director Michael Watkins. \"The experimental MarCO CubeSats have also opened a new door to smaller planetary spacecraft.

The lander is not complaining. We had a way to tell us if it was unhappy, and it wasn't,\" Manning said. It's a normal mode.\" InSight will open its solar panels after it waits for dust to literally clear about four hours after the lander guided itself onto Martian soil. The last several minutes were fraught with anxiety, as technicians braced for any possible scenario. For example, before the parachute deployed, portions of the heat shield became as hot as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We've studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,\" Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a press release. \"Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbor as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.\" InSight marks the first attempt since 2012 for an American spacecraft to visit the red planet. NASA scientists took nothing for granted. On Sunday at 4:47 p.m. ET, engineers were still correcting course \"to steer the spacecraft within a few kilometers of its targeted entry point over Mars,\" NASA said. The monitoring and adjustments to InSight's path continued until the last minute. \"It's taken more than a decade to bring InSight from a concept to a spacecraft approaching Mars - and even longer since I was first inspired to try to undertake this kind of mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"But even after landing, we'll need to be patient for the science to begin.\" ", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/nasas-insight-lander-touch-mars/story?id=59417560"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight Mars lander has touched down. What happens now?", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "After a 205-day journey through space, NASA's InSight lander is safely on the surface of Mars. Tasked with peering beneath the Martian surface and mapping the planet's underworld, InSight touched down at 2:52 p.m. ET in a sunny patch of boring landscape inside the equatorial plains of Elysium Planitia. Anxious teams of scientists and engineers, clustered together at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, knew the spacecraft had survived its wild and tricky descent to the red planet's surface after receiving data suggesting the lander had touched down safely-followed by an image from InSight itself showing a dusty, alien horizon with a single robot foot. \"It's nice and dirty; I like that,\" says Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"This image is actually a really good argument for why you put a dust cover on a camera. Good choice, right?\" After successfully unfurling its solar panels a few hours later, the spacecraft officially became the newest member in an elite fleet of interplanetary robots currently exploring the red planet-including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which monitored InSight's descent. \"I'm very, very happy that it looks like we have an incredibly safe and boring-looking landing plain. That's exactly what we were going for-it's what the landing site selection people promised me,\" says JPL's Tom Hoffman, the InSight project manager. \"They promised me sandy with no rocks. But there's one rock, so I might have to talk with them about that.\" InSight's journey of more than 300 million miles began on May 5 with a foggy, early morning launch from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. Tucked inside its shell, the spacecraft rocketed through the solar system, navigating by starlight as an onboard star tracker helped it stay on course. On November 25 -and then once more, a few hours before touchdown-the spacecraft's entry, descent, and landing team nudged it onto a trajectory that would allow it to bulls-eye in Elysium Planitia. This flat, unremarkable plain was chosen specifically because of the relatively abundant sunlight at the equator and its geologic boringness at the surface, which offers the best chance of finding ideal places to set down its instruments. Once its plunge through the atmosphere was set, the team could only sit back and watch: Without guided entry, InSight had to fly itself to the Martian surface, meaning that a safe landing relied upon correct, preprogrammed commands and on all the necessary onboard instruments functioning properly. \"There are certainly points that will make me smile if they go well,\" Julie Wertz-Chen, an entry, descent, and landing team member, said the week before. As InSight made contact with the planet's thin air, a heat shield protected it from burning up while it whizzed along at 12,300 miles an hour. About a minute later, the spacecraft deployed a parachute that put on a hefty brake and eventually slowed it to 134 miles an hour. Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator on the InSight lander, stands near a replica of InSight used to simulate the landing weeks ahead of the actual touchdown. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Its heat shield then popped off, and an on-board radar began to search for and ultimately lock onto the ground. At 3,280 feet up, InSight ditched its parachute, performed a short free fall, and then fired a dozen descent engines to eventually slow it to a mere five miles an hour. From atmospheric contact to setting robot legs on the ground, the process took just 6 minutes and 45 seconds. \"It was an incredibly emotional experience,\" Hoffman recounts. \"To get to the point where you have seven more minutes to survive, literally survive, is incredibly hard to describe. My heart ... just stopped beating for seven minutes.\" InSight wasn't the only robot entering Martian airspace for the first time today. Two mini-spacecraft, each about the size of a briefcase, were tagging along as part of the first mission to send tiny spacecraft known as CubeSats into interplanetary space. Collectively known as Mars Cube One, but separately referred to as MarCO-A and MarCO-B, their mission was to collect information from InSight as it descended to the surface, and then relay that information to mission control at JPL. They succeeded not only in doing that, but also in sending back a stark, evocative image of Mars as they departed. \"This is a fantastic day for spacecraft, great and small,\" says JPL's Andrew Klesh. \"This team of really mostly part-timers has proven the technology that we were trying to demonstrate with this mission.\" Now that its solar panels are set up, it's time for InSight to get to work. Over the course of one Martian year, it will do something a bit different from most other Mars missions, which have focused on the planet's flashy rift valleys, mammoth volcanoes, or signs of ancient running water on the surface. Instead, this mission aims to get at the heart of Mars, to measure the size of the planet's core and other interior layers. To do this, it will rely on marsquakes -or tremors that are often produced by the same tectonic activity that crafts those beautiful mountains and valleys. One of InSight's primary goals is to figure out how seismically active Mars is, says Renee Weber of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. How NASA's next Mars mission will take the red planet's pulse \"That is something that we don't actually know,\" she says. \"That's basically how many quakes there are, how often they occur, where do they occur, how big they are.\" Weber suspects that Mars will lie somewhere between Earth and moon in terms of tectonic activity. Parked on the surface, InSight is just waiting to snare those signals. Over the next couple months, it will deploy its instruments, including an exquisitely sensitive seismometer that should detect a variety of marsquakes, both those produced by the planet's own spasms and those resulting from meteor impacts. \"To get all the instruments on the ground is expected to take approximately two to three months,\" says JPL's Elizabeth Barrett. \"I liken it to playing that claw game at a carnival, but you're doing it with a really, really valuable prize, and you're doing it blindfolded where you can only take occasional pictures, and then you're doing it via remote control on another planet.\" After the spacecraft determines the location of a marsquake, it will read the incoming seismic waves and use the information they carry to figure out what types of rock they moved through. As marsquakes rock the planet's innards, they send seismic waves bouncing through the interior, signals that travel just a tiny bit differently depending on what kind of material they're moving through.

But one \"unplanned treat\" is a recording of the wind rolling across the Martian plains - which you can listen to right here. Technically the lander isn't rigged to detect sound, at least in the way you'd do it if you were deliberately trying to record it. But the robotic platform's air pressure sensor and seismometer are both capable of detecting the minute variations as the wind rolls over it. The air pressure sensor, inside that silver dome you see above, produced the most normal-sounding signal, though it still had to be adjusted considerably to be like what you'd hear if you were there. \"The InSight lander acts like a giant ear,\" explained InSight science team member Tom Pike in a NASA news release. \"The solar panels on the lander's sides respond to pressure fluctuations of the wind. It's like InSight is cupping its ears and hearing the Mars wind beating on it.\" Sounds a lot like regular wind, right? Well, what were you expecting? Like so many aspects of space exploration, the prosaic nature of the thing itself - a rock, a landscape feature, a breath of wind - is offset by the fact that it's occurring millions of miles away on an alien world and relayed here by a high- tech robot. Wind on Mars might not sound much different than wind on Earth - but surely that's not the point! If you're curious, the air movement in the recording is a northwesterly one, \"consistent with the direction of dust devil streaks\" in the area. Good to know we can rely on InSight's \"ears\" for that purpose, though its science target is below the surface, not skimming above it. We'll have more recordings soon, I'm sure, so you can use it as noise to fall asleep to. But even better sounds are forthcoming: the Mars 2020 rover will have actual high-quality microphones on board, and will record the sounds of its landing as well as the Martian ambience.

The spacecraft used a camera on its robotic arm to take its first selfie - a mosaic made up of 11 images. This is the same imaging process used by NASA's Curiosity rover mission, in which many overlapping pictures are taken and later stitched together. Visible in the selfie are the lander's solar panel and its entire deck, including its science instruments. Mission team members have also received their first complete look at InSight's \"workspace\" - the approximately 14-by-7-foot crescent of terrain directly in front of the spacecraft. This image is also a mosaic composed of 52 individual photos. In the coming weeks, scientists and engineers will go through the painstaking process of deciding where in this workspace the spacecraft's instruments should be placed. They will then command InSight's robotic arm to carefully set the seismometer and heat-flow probe in the chosen locations. Both work best on level ground, and engineers want to avoid setting them on rocks larger than about a half-inch. \"The near-absence of rocks, hills and holes means it'll be extremely safe for our instruments,\" said InSight's Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren't on Mars, but we're glad to see that.\" InSight's landing team deliberately chose a landing region in Elysium Planitia that is relatively free of rocks. Even so, the landing spot turned out even better than they hoped. The spacecraft sits in what appears to be a nearly rock-free \"hollow\" - a depression created by a meteor impact that later filled with sand. That should make it easier for one of InSight's instruments, the heat-flow probe, to bore down to its goal of 16 feet below the surface.

New images from the lander show the seismometer on the ground, its copper-colored covering faintly illuminated in the Martian dusk. It looks as if all is calm and all is bright for InSight, heading into the end of the year. \"InSight's timetable of activities on Mars has gone better than we hoped,\" said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman, who is based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Getting the seismometer safely on the ground is an awesome Christmas present.\" The InSight team has been working carefully toward deploying its two dedicated science instruments onto Martian soil since landing on Mars on Nov. 26. Meanwhile, the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, which does not have its own separate instrument, has already begun using InSight's radio connection with Earth to collect preliminary data on the planet's core. Not enough time has elapsed for scientists to deduce what they want to know - scientists estimate they might have some results starting in about a year. To deploy the seismometer and the heat probe, engineers first had to verify the robotic arm that picks up and places InSight's instruments onto the Martian surface was working properly. Engineers tested the commands for the lander, making sure a model in the test bed at JPL deployed the instruments exactly as intended. Scientists also had to analyze images of the Martian terrain around the lander to figure out the best places to deploy the instruments. On Tuesday, Dec. 18, InSight engineers sent up the commands to the spacecraft. On Wednesday, Dec. 19, the seismometer was gently placed onto the ground directly in front of the lander, about as far away as the arm can reach -- 5.367 feet, or 1.636 meters, away. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\" The seismometer allows scientists to peer into the Martian interior by studying ground motion - also known as marsquakes. Each marsquake acts as a kind of flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet's interior. By analyzing how seismic waves pass through the layers of the planet, scientists can deduce the depth and composition of these layers. \"Having the seismometer on the ground is like holding a phone up to your ear,\" said Philippe Lognonn\u00e9, principal investigator of SEIS from Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Paris Diderot University. \"We're thrilled that we're now in the best position to listen to all the seismic waves from below Mars' surface and from its deep interior.\" In the coming days, the InSight team will work on leveling the seismometer, which is sitting on ground that is tilted 2 to 3 degrees. The first seismometer science data should begin to flow back to Earth after the seismometer is in the right position. But engineers and scientists at JPL, the French national space agency Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales and other institutions affiliated with the SEIS team will need several additional weeks to make sure the returned data are as clear as possible. For one thing, they will check and possibly adjust the seismometer's long, wire-lined tether to minimize noise that could travel along it to the seismometer. Then, in early January, engineers expect to command the robotic arm to place the Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer to stabilize the environment around the sensors. Assuming that there are no unexpected issues, the InSight team plans to deploy the heat probe onto the Martian surface by late January. HP3 will be on the east side of the lander's work space, roughly the same distance away from the lander as the seismometer. For now, though, the team is focusing on getting those first bits of seismic data back from the Martian surface. \"We look forward to popping some Champagne when we start to get data from InSight's seismometer on the ground,\" Banerdt added. \"I have a bottle ready for the occasion.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8402/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars/?site=insight"}, {"title": "InSight team creates Martian rock garden, lander begins work", "date": "2018-12-22", "content": "Using tools ranging from rakes and shovels to augmented reality headsets, engineers with NASA's Mars InSight mission have built a Martian rock garden which recreates the lander's new home on Mars. This allows engineers to practice placing science instrument on the surface using InSight's Earth-bound twin - ForeSight. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory built the rock garden based on photos taken by InSight's cameras. The team used rakes and shovels to shape a bed of gravel-like material called garnet, which is used to simulate Martian sand. These Earth-based explorers were able to match the conditions at InSight's landing sight by wearing Microsoft Hololens-augmented reality headsets which projected digital terrain models of the landing site on to the test bed. The perimeter of the area where the two science instruments would be place was marked with wooden blocks and precision cameras in the lab were used to measure each feature they intended to replicate. Building the rock garden, which mimics every detail down to pebbles or rocks larger than one inch took about four hours. Fortunately, a mosaic image of the lander's workspace released last week shows that the area is smooth and mostly rock-free. \"It's great for the science we want to do,\" said JPL's Marleen Sundgaard, who is guiding the test-bed work. \"It's the flat parking lot the landing team promised us. You calculate the probability of rocks in the area and hope the odds are in your favor.\" NASA sent the commands for InSight to set down its seismometer to Mars on Tuesday, Dec. 18. In a few days, Sundgaard and her colleagues will be waiting to see the first images of their work being replicated on Mars. The latest addition to NASA's family of Martian explorers has been as busy as the crew managing it back on the ground has been. The 794 lbs lander was ordered to place the seismometer on Tuesday, Dec. 18, which it completed on the following day right in front of it. Given that the vehicle is stationary it can only move / place things within the length of its arm. With this instrument in place scientists back on Earth should be able to gain a better understanding the \"goings-on\" inside the Red Planet by listening to how the planet moves. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\"", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-centers/jet-propulsion-laboratory/insight-team-creates-martian-rock-garden-lander-begins-work/"}, {"title": "InSight lander deploys seismometer on Mars", "date": "2019-01-15", "content": "The Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure, SEIS, as seen on Jan. 6, 2019. NASA's InSight Mars lander has been busy getting its suite of instruments prepared for regular use to explore the interior of the Red Planet. The spacecraft, which landed in Elysium Planitia on Nov. 26, 2018, recently deployed and leveled its seismometer to study \"marsquakes.\" A second instrument, the heat flow probe, is waiting for its turn to make a similar trek from the deck of the lander to the surface in the coming weeks. Due to the ongoing partial U.S. government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, 2018, formal updates on the mission's progress have been scarce. However, spacecraft operations have continued as normal thanks in part to the operations budget being previously allocated before the shutdown. Despite few formal updates, the mission's website has remained online and been updated periodically. Additionally, the mission's official Twitter account has remained active. On Jan. 6, a GIF was posted on the mission's Twitter feed showing Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure (SEIS) leveling itself as it prepares to record its first measurements. A second GIF was posted on Jan. 7 from raw images acquired on Jan. 3. It showed the power and data tether leading out to SEIS releasing its slack to rest directly on the surface rather than being flexed above the surface as seen during the instrument's initial deployment. Soon, a large domed solar and wind cover, which is currently sitting on the deck of InSight, is planned to be placed on top of the main SEIS instrument to shield it from the elements. SEIS itself was deployed onto the surface on Dec. 19, 2018. The other main instrument awaiting deployment onto the surface is the heat flow probe (HP3), which aims to \"take the temperature of Mars\" by measuring the residual heat being emitted from the planet's interior. Scientists suspect that Mars has a differentiated interior similar to Earth and other terrestrial bodies in the solar system. By measuring the amount of heat radiated from the planet's core, scientists hope to learn if the core is still molten or partially molten and whether Earth and Mars share similar formation histories. It is hoped that the HP3 measurements will help scientists refine models that predict how terrestrial (or rocky) planetary bodies are expected to form while refining our understanding of Earth's interior as well. Unlike the Curiosity or Opportunity rovers that move across the surface, InSight is a stationary lander. Once its instruments are deployed, it will record measurements at the same location during its two-year prime mission. While more detailed updates from NASA are not expected until the end of the government shutdown, the deployment of SEIS and the probable deployment of HP3 in the coming weeks appear to generally be on schedule.

Scientists and project managers, speaking at a pair of briefings Nov. 21 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said there are no issues with the spacecraft, which is on course for a landing at approximately 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars just north of the planet's equator. Rob Grover, the entry, descent and landing lead for the mission, said that since the latest trajectory correction maneuver by the spacecraft Nov. 18, the spacecraft appears to be within about seven kilometers of the planned landing site. \"We're very close right now,\" he said. \"We may not need our last course correction maneuver.\" He said the project will decide by the end of the day Nov. 23 whether that maneuver, which would take place Nov. 25, is needed. Conditions at the landing site appear to be ideal for landing, he noted. The global dust storm that swept across the planet in June, shutting off contact with the Opportunity Mars rover, has long since faded, and there's been no signs of storms in the vicinity of the landing site. \"We're expecting a very plain day on Mars for the landing, and we're very happy about that,\" he said. The Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft will slow down from 5.5 kilometers per second at the beginning of the EDL phase, about 125 kilometers high, to zero in 6.5 minutes, using a combination of a heat shield, parachute and thrusters. The spacecraft will deploy its solar arrays starting 16 minutes after landing, a delay intended to allow dust kicked up by the landing to settle, with the deployment itself taking an additional 16 minutes. NASA hopes to get realtime telemetry of the landing from a pair of cubesats, called Mars Cube One, that launched as secondary payloads with InSight in May and will fly past Mars during the landing. The MarCO cubesats, intended primarily as technology demonstrations, will be able to relay the telemetry from InSight and broadcast it back to Earth. In addition, InSight itself will broadcast a \"beep\" about seven minutes after landing, a signal indicating that it is on the surface. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will be able to provide data with a brief delay, including a first image from the surface taken by the lander. Confirmation that the lander's solar panels are deployed, though, won't come until about five and a half hours after landing, after an overhead pass from the Mars Odyssey orbiter. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy its two major instruments, a French-built seismometer and a German-built heat probe that will burrow several meters into the surface. Project scientists said that process, including scouting the best locations on the ground by the lander to place the instruments, will take several months. \"InSight is kind of a laid-back, slow-motion mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for InSight at JPL. \"It's going to take us probably two to three months, at least, to get our instruments down.\" He estimated it would be \"early next spring\" before those principal instruments started returning data. One of those instruments, the seismometer, suffered development problems that forced the French space agency CNES to redesign it, pushing back InSight's launch from March 2016 to this May. \"At the beginning it was just impossible to build,\" said Philippe Lognonne, project manager for the instrument at CNES. \"But we did it with the help of our partners.\" With those instruments in place, scientists hope to learn more about the interior of Mars and compare it with other terrestrial planets, including the Earth. \"The number one question we want to answer is what's the structure and the energetics of the interior of Mars,\" Banerdt said. That includes the size and density of the planet's core, the thickness of the planet's crust and the structure of the mantle. \"I've personally have been waiting for this information for decades,\" said Sue Smrekar, deputy principal investigator for InSight at JPL, \"and I'm super excited to get this lander on the ground and start taking this data.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-prepares-for-insight-mars-landing/"}, {"title": "InSight to perform final maneuver before landing", "date": "2018-11-25", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft will perform a final maneuver less than 24 hours before its scheduled landing to slightly adjust the location of its landing site. During a briefing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here Nov. 25, project leaders said they decided to carry out a sixth and final trajectory correction maneuver that is part of the cruise phase of the mission. Managers had suggested at a briefing Nov. 21 that, based on the accuracy of the trajectory at that time, they might skip that final maneuver. Tom Hoffman, project manager for InSight, said at the briefing that after the fifth TCM Nov. 18, the center of the landing ellipse, representing the region on the planet the spacecraft would land in, was off its target by about 18 kilometers. That difference was enough for him and other mission officials, at a meeting a few hours before the briefing, to decide to carry out the final maneuver. \"We want to avoid the area up here,\" he said, referring to a region with rougher terrain near the edge of the current landing ellipse. \"That's not a great area to land.\" That maneuver, known as TCM-6 and taking place about 22 hours before the 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 landing, will change the spacecraft's velocity by just a few centimeters per second. \"Hopefully within a few hours after that we're going to know exactly where we're landing,\" he said. \"Things should be in good shape.\" The maneuver, he said, is intended to move the center of the landing ellipse back to the target, marked on images with a red X, and avoid the undesirable terrain, a decision that came after what Hoffman called a \"very exciting\" meeting earlier in the day. \"We listened to all the different inputs and the final decision was to go ahead and do the TCM and move ourselves back to that red X,\" he said, \"and be exactly where we really want to land from both a safety standpoint as well as making sure we have the right location for our science instruments.\" Officials said that, other than the decision to perform the final maneuver, there are no issues with the spacecraft, formally known as Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The mission, with a total cost including international contributions of nearly $1 billion, is designed to study the composition and structure of the interior of Mars using a seismometer and heat flow probe. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy those two instruments over the next few months, collecting data on a prime mission scheduled to last two years. \"It feels like a climax,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight at JPL, of the landing, \"but it's actually the beginning.\" He and others involved with the mission expressed a mix of confidence that the spacecraft, based on the Phoenix Mars Lander that successfully landed on Mars a decade ago, would make to the surface, as well as nervousness as the landing approaches. \"I'm actually really confident, personally, that we're going to land safely tomorrow,\" Banerdt said. \"It doesn't mean I'm not nervous.\" \"We recognize that we never take Mars for granted,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science. \"Mars is hard.\" Hoffman noted he spent the Thanksgiving holiday with family, including three young grandsons who, when excited, run around and yell. \"Inside of me right now I'm just about the same,\" he said. As soon as he receives word of a successful landing, he said, \"I'm going to unleash my inner four-year-old.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/insight-to-perform-final-maneuver-before-landing/"}, {"title": "NASA InSight Lander Arrives on Martian Surface", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "Mars has just received its newest robotic resident. NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet after an almost seven-month, 300-million-mile journey from Earth. InSight's two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed. InSight launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5. The lander touched down Monday, Nov. 26, near Mars' equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia, at 11:52:59 a.m. PST. \"Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"InSight will study the interior of Mars and will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars. This accomplishment represents the ingenuity of America and our international partners, and it serves as a testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team. The best of NASA is yet to come, and it is coming soon.\" The landing signal was relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, via NASA's two small experimental Mars Cube One CubeSats, which launched on the same rocket as InSight and followed the lander to Mars. They are the first CubeSats sent into deep space. After successfully carrying out a number of communications and in-flight navigation experiments, the twin MarCOs were set in position to receive transmissions during InSight's entry, descent and landing. \"We hit the Martian atmosphere at 12,300 mph, and the whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes,\" said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"During that short span of time, InSight had to autonomously perform dozens of operations and do them flawlessly - and by all indications that is exactly what our spacecraft did.\" Confirmation of a successful touchdown is not the end of the challenges of landing on the Red Planet. InSight's surface-operations phase began a minute after touchdown. One of its first tasks is to deploy its two decagonal solar arrays, which will provide power. That process begins 16 minutes after landing and takes another 16 minutes to complete. The InSight team expects a confirmation later Monday that the spacecraft's solar panels successfully deployed. Verification will come from NASA's Odyssey spacecraft, currently orbiting Mars. That signal is expected to reach InSight's mission control at JPL about five-and-a-half hours after landing. \"We are solar powered, so getting the arrays out and operating is a big deal,\" said Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"With the arrays providing the energy we need to start the cool science operations, we are well on our way to thoroughly investigate what's inside of Mars for the very first time.\" InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight's instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight's 5.9-foot-long robotic arm so that it can take images of the landscape. \"Landing was thrilling, but I'm looking forward to the drilling,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"When the first images come down, our engineering and science teams will hit the ground running, beginning to plan where to deploy our science instruments. Within two or three months, the arm will deploy the mission's main science instruments, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure and Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instruments.\" InSight will operate on the surface for one Martian year, plus 40 Martian days, or sols, until Nov. 24, 2020. The mission objectives of the two small MarCOs which relayed InSight's telemetry was completed after their Martian flyby. \"That's one giant leap for our intrepid, briefcase-sized robotic explorers,\" said Joel Krajewski, MarCO project manager at JPL. \"I think CubeSats have a big future beyond Earth's orbit, and the MarCO team is happy to trailblaze the way.\" With InSight's landing at Elysium Planitia, NASA has successfully soft-landed a vehicle on the Red Planet eight times. \"Every Mars landing is daunting, but now with InSight safely on the surface we get to do a unique kind of science on Mars,\" said JPL director Michael Watkins. \"The experimental MarCO CubeSats have also opened a new door to smaller planetary spacecraft. The success of these two unique missions is a tribute to the hundreds of talented engineers and scientists who put their genius and labor into making this a great day.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8392/nasa-insight-lander-arrives-on-martian-surface/?site=insight"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight lander touches down on Mars after daring maneuver", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft landed on Mars Monday afternoon, finishing one journey -- through space -- and now launching on another: to go deeper into Mars. The mechanical three-legged, one-armed mining spacecraft landed as planned just before 3 p.m. ET. InSight will be the first mission to drill into the deep interior of Mars as well as investigate if there are \"Marsquakes.\" \"It was tense, you could feel the emotion. It was celebratory with every new information we received,\" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said on a NASA livestream. He said he received a call on his cellphone from a number that was \"all zeroes\" seconds after the landing. It was Vice President Mike Pence. \"He watched the whole thing. He is absolutely ecstatic about our program,\" Bridenstine said. \"He wants me to say congratulations to everyone here at NASA and all of our international partners.\" Pence is chairman of the National Space Council and promotes President Trump's \"Space Force\" plan for a branch of the military in outer space. Dressed in maroon button-down shirts, scientists and engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, could be seen cheering, clapping and hugging after the daring landing. The trip that started seven months and more than 300 million miles ago ended in an anxiety-filled but ultimately smooth last six minutes of entry, descent and landing onto the Martian surface. Jars of peanuts, a good luck token at JPL, were seen throughout the room. \"Flawless. This is what we hoped and imagined in our minds' eye. It looked like it was a very successful and perfect landing,\" Rob Manning, JPL's chief engineer, said minutes after the probe landed. \"The vehicle is nominal. It's happy. The lander is not complaining. We had a way to tell us if it was unhappy, and it wasn't,\" Manning said. It's a normal mode.\" InSight will open its solar panels after it waits for dust to literally clear about four hours after the lander guided itself onto Martian soil. The last several minutes were fraught with anxiety, as technicians braced for any possible scenario. For example, before the parachute deployed, portions of the heat shield became as hot as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We've studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,\" Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a press release. \"Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbor as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.\" InSight marks the first attempt since 2012 for an American spacecraft to visit the red planet. NASA scientists took nothing for granted. On Sunday at 4:47 p.m. ET, engineers were still correcting course \"to steer the spacecraft within a few kilometers of its targeted entry point over Mars,\" NASA said. The monitoring and adjustments to InSight's path continued until the last minute. \"It's taken more than a decade to bring InSight from a concept to a spacecraft approaching Mars - and even longer since I was first inspired to try to undertake this kind of mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"But even after landing, we'll need to be patient for the science to begin.\" ", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/nasas-insight-lander-touch-mars/story?id=59417560"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight Mars lander has touched down. What happens now?", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "After a 205-day journey through space, NASA's InSight lander is safely on the surface of Mars. Tasked with peering beneath the Martian surface and mapping the planet's underworld, InSight touched down at 2:52 p.m. ET in a sunny patch of boring landscape inside the equatorial plains of Elysium Planitia. Anxious teams of scientists and engineers, clustered together at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, knew the spacecraft had survived its wild and tricky descent to the red planet's surface after receiving data suggesting the lander had touched down safely-followed by an image from InSight itself showing a dusty, alien horizon with a single robot foot. \"It's nice and dirty; I like that,\" says Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"This image is actually a really good argument for why you put a dust cover on a camera. Good choice, right?\" After successfully unfurling its solar panels a few hours later, the spacecraft officially became the newest member in an elite fleet of interplanetary robots currently exploring the red planet-including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which monitored InSight's descent. \"I'm very, very happy that it looks like we have an incredibly safe and boring-looking landing plain. That's exactly what we were going for-it's what the landing site selection people promised me,\" says JPL's Tom Hoffman, the InSight project manager. \"They promised me sandy with no rocks. But there's one rock, so I might have to talk with them about that.\" InSight's journey of more than 300 million miles began on May 5 with a foggy, early morning launch from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. Tucked inside its shell, the spacecraft rocketed through the solar system, navigating by starlight as an onboard star tracker helped it stay on course. On November 25 -and then once more, a few hours before touchdown-the spacecraft's entry, descent, and landing team nudged it onto a trajectory that would allow it to bulls-eye in Elysium Planitia. This flat, unremarkable plain was chosen specifically because of the relatively abundant sunlight at the equator and its geologic boringness at the surface, which offers the best chance of finding ideal places to set down its instruments. Once its plunge through the atmosphere was set, the team could only sit back and watch: Without guided entry, InSight had to fly itself to the Martian surface, meaning that a safe landing relied upon correct, preprogrammed commands and on all the necessary onboard instruments functioning properly. \"There are certainly points that will make me smile if they go well,\" Julie Wertz-Chen, an entry, descent, and landing team member, said the week before. As InSight made contact with the planet's thin air, a heat shield protected it from burning up while it whizzed along at 12,300 miles an hour. About a minute later, the spacecraft deployed a parachute that put on a hefty brake and eventually slowed it to 134 miles an hour. Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator on the InSight lander, stands near a replica of InSight used to simulate the landing weeks ahead of the actual touchdown. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Its heat shield then popped off, and an on-board radar began to search for and ultimately lock onto the ground. At 3,280 feet up, InSight ditched its parachute, performed a short free fall, and then fired a dozen descent engines to eventually slow it to a mere five miles an hour. From atmospheric contact to setting robot legs on the ground, the process took just 6 minutes and 45 seconds. \"It was an incredibly emotional experience,\" Hoffman recounts. \"To get to the point where you have seven more minutes to survive, literally survive, is incredibly hard to describe. My heart ... just stopped beating for seven minutes.\" InSight wasn't the only robot entering Martian airspace for the first time today. Two mini-spacecraft, each about the size of a briefcase, were tagging along as part of the first mission to send tiny spacecraft known as CubeSats into interplanetary space. Collectively known as Mars Cube One, but separately referred to as MarCO-A and MarCO-B, their mission was to collect information from InSight as it descended to the surface, and then relay that information to mission control at JPL. They succeeded not only in doing that, but also in sending back a stark, evocative image of Mars as they departed. \"This is a fantastic day for spacecraft, great and small,\" says JPL's Andrew Klesh. \"This team of really mostly part-timers has proven the technology that we were trying to demonstrate with this mission.\" Now that its solar panels are set up, it's time for InSight to get to work. Over the course of one Martian year, it will do something a bit different from most other Mars missions, which have focused on the planet's flashy rift valleys, mammoth volcanoes, or signs of ancient running water on the surface. Instead, this mission aims to get at the heart of Mars, to measure the size of the planet's core and other interior layers. To do this, it will rely on marsquakes -or tremors that are often produced by the same tectonic activity that crafts those beautiful mountains and valleys. One of InSight's primary goals is to figure out how seismically active Mars is, says Renee Weber of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. How NASA's next Mars mission will take the red planet's pulse \"That is something that we don't actually know,\" she says. \"That's basically how many quakes there are, how often they occur, where do they occur, how big they are.\" Weber suspects that Mars will lie somewhere between Earth and moon in terms of tectonic activity. Parked on the surface, InSight is just waiting to snare those signals. Over the next couple months, it will deploy its instruments, including an exquisitely sensitive seismometer that should detect a variety of marsquakes, both those produced by the planet's own spasms and those resulting from meteor impacts. \"To get all the instruments on the ground is expected to take approximately two to three months,\" says JPL's Elizabeth Barrett. \"I liken it to playing that claw game at a carnival, but you're doing it with a really, really valuable prize, and you're doing it blindfolded where you can only take occasional pictures, and then you're doing it via remote control on another planet.\" After the spacecraft determines the location of a marsquake, it will read the incoming seismic waves and use the information they carry to figure out what types of rock they moved through. As marsquakes rock the planet's innards, they send seismic waves bouncing through the interior, signals that travel just a tiny bit differently depending on what kind of material they're moving through.

But one \"unplanned treat\" is a recording of the wind rolling across the Martian plains - which you can listen to right here. Technically the lander isn't rigged to detect sound, at least in the way you'd do it if you were deliberately trying to record it. But the robotic platform's air pressure sensor and seismometer are both capable of detecting the minute variations as the wind rolls over it. The air pressure sensor, inside that silver dome you see above, produced the most normal-sounding signal, though it still had to be adjusted considerably to be like what you'd hear if you were there. \"The InSight lander acts like a giant ear,\" explained InSight science team member Tom Pike in a NASA news release. \"The solar panels on the lander's sides respond to pressure fluctuations of the wind. It's like InSight is cupping its ears and hearing the Mars wind beating on it.\" Sounds a lot like regular wind, right? Well, what were you expecting? Like so many aspects of space exploration, the prosaic nature of the thing itself - a rock, a landscape feature, a breath of wind - is offset by the fact that it's occurring millions of miles away on an alien world and relayed here by a high- tech robot. Wind on Mars might not sound much different than wind on Earth - but surely that's not the point! If you're curious, the air movement in the recording is a northwesterly one, \"consistent with the direction of dust devil streaks\" in the area. Good to know we can rely on InSight's \"ears\" for that purpose, though its science target is below the surface, not skimming above it. We'll have more recordings soon, I'm sure, so you can use it as noise to fall asleep to. But even better sounds are forthcoming: the Mars 2020 rover will have actual high-quality microphones on board, and will record the sounds of its landing as well as the Martian ambience.

This is the same imaging process used by NASA's Curiosity rover mission, in which many overlapping pictures are taken and later stitched together. Visible in the selfie are the lander's solar panel and its entire deck, including its science instruments. Mission team members have also received their first complete look at InSight's \"workspace\" - the approximately 14-by-7-foot crescent of terrain directly in front of the spacecraft. This image is also a mosaic composed of 52 individual photos. In the coming weeks, scientists and engineers will go through the painstaking process of deciding where in this workspace the spacecraft's instruments should be placed. They will then command InSight's robotic arm to carefully set the seismometer and heat-flow probe in the chosen locations. Both work best on level ground, and engineers want to avoid setting them on rocks larger than about a half-inch. \"The near-absence of rocks, hills and holes means it'll be extremely safe for our instruments,\" said InSight's Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren't on Mars, but we're glad to see that.\" InSight's landing team deliberately chose a landing region in Elysium Planitia that is relatively free of rocks. Even so, the landing spot turned out even better than they hoped. The spacecraft sits in what appears to be a nearly rock-free \"hollow\" - a depression created by a meteor impact that later filled with sand.

New images from the lander show the seismometer on the ground, its copper-colored covering faintly illuminated in the Martian dusk. It looks as if all is calm and all is bright for InSight, heading into the end of the year. \"InSight's timetable of activities on Mars has gone better than we hoped,\" said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman, who is based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Getting the seismometer safely on the ground is an awesome Christmas present.\" The InSight team has been working carefully toward deploying its two dedicated science instruments onto Martian soil since landing on Mars on Nov. 26. Meanwhile, the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, which does not have its own separate instrument, has already begun using InSight's radio connection with Earth to collect preliminary data on the planet's core. Not enough time has elapsed for scientists to deduce what they want to know - scientists estimate they might have some results starting in about a year. To deploy the seismometer and the heat probe, engineers first had to verify the robotic arm that picks up and places InSight's instruments onto the Martian surface was working properly. Engineers tested the commands for the lander, making sure a model in the test bed at JPL deployed the instruments exactly as intended. Scientists also had to analyze images of the Martian terrain around the lander to figure out the best places to deploy the instruments. On Tuesday, Dec. 18, InSight engineers sent up the commands to the spacecraft. On Wednesday, Dec. 19, the seismometer was gently placed onto the ground directly in front of the lander, about as far away as the arm can reach -- 5.367 feet, or 1.636 meters, away. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\" The seismometer allows scientists to peer into the Martian interior by studying ground motion - also known as marsquakes. Each marsquake acts as a kind of flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet's interior. By analyzing how seismic waves pass through the layers of the planet, scientists can deduce the depth and composition of these layers. \"Having the seismometer on the ground is like holding a phone up to your ear,\" said Philippe Lognonn\u00e9, principal investigator of SEIS from Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Paris Diderot University. \"We're thrilled that we're now in the best position to listen to all the seismic waves from below Mars' surface and from its deep interior.\" In the coming days, the InSight team will work on leveling the seismometer, which is sitting on ground that is tilted 2 to 3 degrees. The first seismometer science data should begin to flow back to Earth after the seismometer is in the right position. But engineers and scientists at JPL, the French national space agency Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales and other institutions affiliated with the SEIS team will need several additional weeks to make sure the returned data are as clear as possible. For one thing, they will check and possibly adjust the seismometer's long, wire-lined tether to minimize noise that could travel along it to the seismometer. Then, in early January, engineers expect to command the robotic arm to place the Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer to stabilize the environment around the sensors. Assuming that there are no unexpected issues, the InSight team plans to deploy the heat probe onto the Martian surface by late January. HP3 will be on the east side of the lander's work space, roughly the same distance away from the lander as the seismometer. For now, though, the team is focusing on getting those first bits of seismic data back from the Martian surface. \"We look forward to popping some Champagne when we start to get data from InSight's seismometer on the ground,\" Banerdt added. \"I have a bottle ready for the occasion.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8402/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars/?site=insight"}, {"title": "InSight team creates Martian rock garden, lander begins work", "date": "2018-12-22", "content": "Using tools ranging from rakes and shovels to augmented reality headsets, engineers with NASA's Mars InSight mission have built a Martian rock garden which recreates the lander's new home on Mars. This allows engineers to practice placing science instrument on the surface using InSight's Earth-bound twin - ForeSight. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory built the rock garden based on photos taken by InSight's cameras. The team used rakes and shovels to shape a bed of gravel-like material called garnet, which is used to simulate Martian sand. These Earth-based explorers were able to match the conditions at InSight's landing sight by wearing Microsoft Hololens-augmented reality headsets which projected digital terrain models of the landing site on to the test bed. The perimeter of the area where the two science instruments would be place was marked with wooden blocks and precision cameras in the lab were used to measure each feature they intended to replicate. Building the rock garden, which mimics every detail down to pebbles or rocks larger than one inch took about four hours. Fortunately, a mosaic image of the lander's workspace released last week shows that the area is smooth and mostly rock-free. \"It's great for the science we want to do,\" said JPL's Marleen Sundgaard, who is guiding the test-bed work. \"It's the flat parking lot the landing team promised us. You calculate the probability of rocks in the area and hope the odds are in your favor.\" NASA sent the commands for InSight to set down its seismometer to Mars on Tuesday, Dec. 18. In a few days, Sundgaard and her colleagues will be waiting to see the first images of their work being replicated on Mars. The latest addition to NASA's family of Martian explorers has been as busy as the crew managing it back on the ground has been. The 794 lbs lander was ordered to place the seismometer on Tuesday, Dec. 18, which it completed on the following day right in front of it. Given that the vehicle is stationary it can only move / place things within the length of its arm. With this instrument in place scientists back on Earth should be able to gain a better understanding the \"goings-on\" inside the Red Planet by listening to how the planet moves. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\"", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-centers/jet-propulsion-laboratory/insight-team-creates-martian-rock-garden-lander-begins-work/"}, {"title": "InSight lander deploys seismometer on Mars", "date": "2019-01-15", "content": "The Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure, SEIS, as seen on Jan. 6, 2019. NASA's InSight Mars lander has been busy getting its suite of instruments prepared for regular use to explore the interior of the Red Planet. The spacecraft, which landed in Elysium Planitia on Nov. 26, 2018, recently deployed and leveled its seismometer to study \"marsquakes.\" A second instrument, the heat flow probe, is waiting for its turn to make a similar trek from the deck of the lander to the surface in the coming weeks. Due to the ongoing partial U.S. government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, 2018, formal updates on the mission's progress have been scarce. However, spacecraft operations have continued as normal thanks in part to the operations budget being previously allocated before the shutdown. Despite few formal updates, the mission's website has remained online and been updated periodically. Additionally, the mission's official Twitter account has remained active. On Jan. 6, a GIF was posted on the mission's Twitter feed showing Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure (SEIS) leveling itself as it prepares to record its first measurements. A second GIF was posted on Jan. 7 from raw images acquired on Jan. 3. It showed the power and data tether leading out to SEIS releasing its slack to rest directly on the surface rather than being flexed above the surface as seen during the instrument's initial deployment. Soon, a large domed solar and wind cover, which is currently sitting on the deck of InSight, is planned to be placed on top of the main SEIS instrument to shield it from the elements. SEIS itself was deployed onto the surface on Dec. 19, 2018. The other main instrument awaiting deployment onto the surface is the heat flow probe (HP3), which aims to \"take the temperature of Mars\" by measuring the residual heat being emitted from the planet's interior. Scientists suspect that Mars has a differentiated interior similar to Earth and other terrestrial bodies in the solar system. By measuring the amount of heat radiated from the planet's core, scientists hope to learn if the core is still molten or partially molten and whether Earth and Mars share similar formation histories. It is hoped that the HP3 measurements will help scientists refine models that predict how terrestrial (or rocky) planetary bodies are expected to form while refining our understanding of Earth's interior as well. Unlike the Curiosity or Opportunity rovers that move across the surface, InSight is a stationary lander. Once its instruments are deployed, it will record measurements at the same location during its two-year prime mission. While more detailed updates from NASA are not expected until the end of the government shutdown, the deployment of SEIS and the probable deployment of HP3 in the coming weeks appear to generally be on schedule.

It will give researchers greater confidence in the accuracy of the readings of seismic signals. InSight expects to detect the vibrations from \"Marsquakes\" and meteorite impacts. The data will be used to build a picture of the rock layers inside the Red Planet - from its core to its crust. The instrument - known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) - is led from France, but includes a package of high-frequency sensors (SEIS-SP Short Period) from the UK.

With the seismometer system in position, Nasa controllers will now work on deploying InSight's heat flow probe. This German-led experiment, called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), will be making complementary measurements to the seismometer. HP3 incorporates a \"mole\" to drill down up to 5m below the surface. Its inbuilt sensors will help determine how heat moves through the ground. It is information that will give scientists an idea of how active Mars still is. HP3 is likely to be placed on the surface by InSight's robot arm next week. A third experiment on InSight uses the lander's radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. The Nasa mission landed on Mars on 26 November.

The deployment process, like that for the lander's seismometer, relies on the grapple-like claw at the end of InSight's robotic arm.

That should help scientists understand the properties of Martian regolith. The heat probe will follow its predecessor, the seismometer instrument that will track seismic waves through the interior Mars to try to map its structure. Scientists believe the planet is home to so-called marsquakes, which would create such waves, but the seismometer will also register echoes from meteorite impacts and from the heat probe itself during its drilling process. Scientists have images of the seismometer not only taken by the lander itself, but also as spotted by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the planet since March 2006.

Rob Grover, the entry, descent and landing lead for the mission, said that since the latest trajectory correction maneuver by the spacecraft Nov. 18, the spacecraft appears to be within about seven kilometers of the planned landing site. \"We're very close right now,\" he said. \"We may not need our last course correction maneuver.\" He said the project will decide by the end of the day Nov. 23 whether that maneuver, which would take place Nov. 25, is needed. Conditions at the landing site appear to be ideal for landing, he noted. The global dust storm that swept across the planet in June, shutting off contact with the Opportunity Mars rover, has long since faded, and there's been no signs of storms in the vicinity of the landing site. \"We're expecting a very plain day on Mars for the landing, and we're very happy about that,\" he said. The Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft will slow down from 5.5 kilometers per second at the beginning of the EDL phase, about 125 kilometers high, to zero in 6.5 minutes, using a combination of a heat shield, parachute and thrusters. The spacecraft will deploy its solar arrays starting 16 minutes after landing, a delay intended to allow dust kicked up by the landing to settle, with the deployment itself taking an additional 16 minutes. NASA hopes to get realtime telemetry of the landing from a pair of cubesats, called Mars Cube One, that launched as secondary payloads with InSight in May and will fly past Mars during the landing. The MarCO cubesats, intended primarily as technology demonstrations, will be able to relay the telemetry from InSight and broadcast it back to Earth. In addition, InSight itself will broadcast a \"beep\" about seven minutes after landing, a signal indicating that it is on the surface. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will be able to provide data with a brief delay, including a first image from the surface taken by the lander. Confirmation that the lander's solar panels are deployed, though, won't come until about five and a half hours after landing, after an overhead pass from the Mars Odyssey orbiter. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy its two major instruments, a French-built seismometer and a German-built heat probe that will burrow several meters into the surface. Project scientists said that process, including scouting the best locations on the ground by the lander to place the instruments, will take several months. \"InSight is kind of a laid-back, slow-motion mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for InSight at JPL. \"It's going to take us probably two to three months, at least, to get our instruments down.\" He estimated it would be \"early next spring\" before those principal instruments started returning data. One of those instruments, the seismometer, suffered development problems that forced the French space agency CNES to redesign it, pushing back InSight's launch from March 2016 to this May. \"At the beginning it was just impossible to build,\" said Philippe Lognonne, project manager for the instrument at CNES. \"But we did it with the help of our partners.\" With those instruments in place, scientists hope to learn more about the interior of Mars and compare it with other terrestrial planets, including the Earth. \"The number one question we want to answer is what's the structure and the energetics of the interior of Mars,\" Banerdt said. That includes the size and density of the planet's core, the thickness of the planet's crust and the structure of the mantle. \"I've personally have been waiting for this information for decades,\" said Sue Smrekar, deputy principal investigator for InSight at JPL, \"and I'm super excited to get this lander on the ground and start taking this data.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-prepares-for-insight-mars-landing/"}, {"title": "InSight to perform final maneuver before landing", "date": "2018-11-25", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft will perform a final maneuver less than 24 hours before its scheduled landing to slightly adjust the location of its landing site. During a briefing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here Nov. 25, project leaders said they decided to carry out a sixth and final trajectory correction maneuver that is part of the cruise phase of the mission. Managers had suggested at a briefing Nov. 21 that, based on the accuracy of the trajectory at that time, they might skip that final maneuver. Tom Hoffman, project manager for InSight, said at the briefing that after the fifth TCM Nov. 18, the center of the landing ellipse, representing the region on the planet the spacecraft would land in, was off its target by about 18 kilometers. That difference was enough for him and other mission officials, at a meeting a few hours before the briefing, to decide to carry out the final maneuver. \"We want to avoid the area up here,\" he said, referring to a region with rougher terrain near the edge of the current landing ellipse. \"That's not a great area to land.\" That maneuver, known as TCM-6 and taking place about 22 hours before the 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 landing, will change the spacecraft's velocity by just a few centimeters per second. \"Hopefully within a few hours after that we're going to know exactly where we're landing,\" he said. \"Things should be in good shape.\" The maneuver, he said, is intended to move the center of the landing ellipse back to the target, marked on images with a red X, and avoid the undesirable terrain, a decision that came after what Hoffman called a \"very exciting\" meeting earlier in the day. \"We listened to all the different inputs and the final decision was to go ahead and do the TCM and move ourselves back to that red X,\" he said, \"and be exactly where we really want to land from both a safety standpoint as well as making sure we have the right location for our science instruments.\" Officials said that, other than the decision to perform the final maneuver, there are no issues with the spacecraft, formally known as Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The mission, with a total cost including international contributions of nearly $1 billion, is designed to study the composition and structure of the interior of Mars using a seismometer and heat flow probe. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy those two instruments over the next few months, collecting data on a prime mission scheduled to last two years. \"It feels like a climax,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight at JPL, of the landing, \"but it's actually the beginning.\" He and others involved with the mission expressed a mix of confidence that the spacecraft, based on the Phoenix Mars Lander that successfully landed on Mars a decade ago, would make to the surface, as well as nervousness as the landing approaches. \"I'm actually really confident, personally, that we're going to land safely tomorrow,\" Banerdt said. \"It doesn't mean I'm not nervous.\" \"We recognize that we never take Mars for granted,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science. \"Mars is hard.\" Hoffman noted he spent the Thanksgiving holiday with family, including three young grandsons who, when excited, run around and yell. \"Inside of me right now I'm just about the same,\" he said. As soon as he receives word of a successful landing, he said, \"I'm going to unleash my inner four-year-old.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/insight-to-perform-final-maneuver-before-landing/"}, {"title": "NASA InSight Lander Arrives on Martian Surface", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "Mars has just received its newest robotic resident. NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet after an almost seven-month, 300-million-mile journey from Earth. InSight's two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed. InSight launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5. The lander touched down Monday, Nov. 26, near Mars' equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia, at 11:52:59 a.m. PST. \"Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"InSight will study the interior of Mars and will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars. This accomplishment represents the ingenuity of America and our international partners, and it serves as a testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team. The best of NASA is yet to come, and it is coming soon.\" The landing signal was relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, via NASA's two small experimental Mars Cube One CubeSats, which launched on the same rocket as InSight and followed the lander to Mars. They are the first CubeSats sent into deep space. After successfully carrying out a number of communications and in-flight navigation experiments, the twin MarCOs were set in position to receive transmissions during InSight's entry, descent and landing. \"We hit the Martian atmosphere at 12,300 mph, and the whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes,\" said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"During that short span of time, InSight had to autonomously perform dozens of operations and do them flawlessly - and by all indications that is exactly what our spacecraft did.\" Confirmation of a successful touchdown is not the end of the challenges of landing on the Red Planet. InSight's surface-operations phase began a minute after touchdown. One of its first tasks is to deploy its two decagonal solar arrays, which will provide power. That process begins 16 minutes after landing and takes another 16 minutes to complete. The InSight team expects a confirmation later Monday that the spacecraft's solar panels successfully deployed. Verification will come from NASA's Odyssey spacecraft, currently orbiting Mars. That signal is expected to reach InSight's mission control at JPL about five-and-a-half hours after landing. \"We are solar powered, so getting the arrays out and operating is a big deal,\" said Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"With the arrays providing the energy we need to start the cool science operations, we are well on our way to thoroughly investigate what's inside of Mars for the very first time.\" InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight's instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight's 5.9-foot-long robotic arm so that it can take images of the landscape. \"Landing was thrilling, but I'm looking forward to the drilling,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"When the first images come down, our engineering and science teams will hit the ground running, beginning to plan where to deploy our science instruments. Within two or three months, the arm will deploy the mission's main science instruments, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure and Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instruments.\" InSight will operate on the surface for one Martian year, plus 40 Martian days, or sols, until Nov. 24, 2020. The mission objectives of the two small MarCOs which relayed InSight's telemetry was completed after their Martian flyby. \"That's one giant leap for our intrepid, briefcase-sized robotic explorers,\" said Joel Krajewski, MarCO project manager at JPL. \"I think CubeSats have a big future beyond Earth's orbit, and the MarCO team is happy to trailblaze the way.\" With InSight's landing at Elysium Planitia, NASA has successfully soft-landed a vehicle on the Red Planet eight times. \"Every Mars landing is daunting, but now with InSight safely on the surface we get to do a unique kind of science on Mars,\" said JPL director Michael Watkins. \"The experimental MarCO CubeSats have also opened a new door to smaller planetary spacecraft. The success of these two unique missions is a tribute to the hundreds of talented engineers and scientists who put their genius and labor into making this a great day.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8392/nasa-insight-lander-arrives-on-martian-surface/?site=insight"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight lander touches down on Mars after daring maneuver", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft landed on Mars Monday afternoon, finishing one journey -- through space -- and now launching on another: to go deeper into Mars. The mechanical three-legged, one-armed mining spacecraft landed as planned just before 3 p.m. ET. InSight will be the first mission to drill into the deep interior of Mars as well as investigate if there are \"Marsquakes.\" \"It was tense, you could feel the emotion. It was celebratory with every new information we received,\" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said on a NASA livestream. He said he received a call on his cellphone from a number that was \"all zeroes\" seconds after the landing. It was Vice President Mike Pence. \"He watched the whole thing. He is absolutely ecstatic about our program,\" Bridenstine said. \"He wants me to say congratulations to everyone here at NASA and all of our international partners.\" Pence is chairman of the National Space Council and promotes President Trump's \"Space Force\" plan for a branch of the military in outer space. Dressed in maroon button-down shirts, scientists and engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, could be seen cheering, clapping and hugging after the daring landing. The trip that started seven months and more than 300 million miles ago ended in an anxiety-filled but ultimately smooth last six minutes of entry, descent and landing onto the Martian surface. Jars of peanuts, a good luck token at JPL, were seen throughout the room. \"Flawless. This is what we hoped and imagined in our minds' eye. It looked like it was a very successful and perfect landing,\" Rob Manning, JPL's chief engineer, said minutes after the probe landed. \"The vehicle is nominal. It's happy. The lander is not complaining. We had a way to tell us if it was unhappy, and it wasn't,\" Manning said. It's a normal mode.\" InSight will open its solar panels after it waits for dust to literally clear about four hours after the lander guided itself onto Martian soil. The last several minutes were fraught with anxiety, as technicians braced for any possible scenario. For example, before the parachute deployed, portions of the heat shield became as hot as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We've studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,\" Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a press release. \"Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbor as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.\" InSight marks the first attempt since 2012 for an American spacecraft to visit the red planet. NASA scientists took nothing for granted. On Sunday at 4:47 p.m. ET, engineers were still correcting course \"to steer the spacecraft within a few kilometers of its targeted entry point over Mars,\" NASA said. The monitoring and adjustments to InSight's path continued until the last minute. \"It's taken more than a decade to bring InSight from a concept to a spacecraft approaching Mars - and even longer since I was first inspired to try to undertake this kind of mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"But even after landing, we'll need to be patient for the science to begin.\" ", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/nasas-insight-lander-touch-mars/story?id=59417560"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight Mars lander has touched down. What happens now?", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "After a 205-day journey through space, NASA's InSight lander is safely on the surface of Mars. Tasked with peering beneath the Martian surface and mapping the planet's underworld, InSight touched down at 2:52 p.m. ET in a sunny patch of boring landscape inside the equatorial plains of Elysium Planitia. Anxious teams of scientists and engineers, clustered together at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, knew the spacecraft had survived its wild and tricky descent to the red planet's surface after receiving data suggesting the lander had touched down safely-followed by an image from InSight itself showing a dusty, alien horizon with a single robot foot. \"It's nice and dirty; I like that,\" says Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"This image is actually a really good argument for why you put a dust cover on a camera. Good choice, right?\" After successfully unfurling its solar panels a few hours later, the spacecraft officially became the newest member in an elite fleet of interplanetary robots currently exploring the red planet-including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which monitored InSight's descent. \"I'm very, very happy that it looks like we have an incredibly safe and boring-looking landing plain. That's exactly what we were going for-it's what the landing site selection people promised me,\" says JPL's Tom Hoffman, the InSight project manager. \"They promised me sandy with no rocks. But there's one rock, so I might have to talk with them about that.\" InSight's journey of more than 300 million miles began on May 5 with a foggy, early morning launch from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. Tucked inside its shell, the spacecraft rocketed through the solar system, navigating by starlight as an onboard star tracker helped it stay on course. On November 25 -and then once more, a few hours before touchdown-the spacecraft's entry, descent, and landing team nudged it onto a trajectory that would allow it to bulls-eye in Elysium Planitia. This flat, unremarkable plain was chosen specifically because of the relatively abundant sunlight at the equator and its geologic boringness at the surface, which offers the best chance of finding ideal places to set down its instruments. Once its plunge through the atmosphere was set, the team could only sit back and watch: Without guided entry, InSight had to fly itself to the Martian surface, meaning that a safe landing relied upon correct, preprogrammed commands and on all the necessary onboard instruments functioning properly. \"There are certainly points that will make me smile if they go well,\" Julie Wertz-Chen, an entry, descent, and landing team member, said the week before. As InSight made contact with the planet's thin air, a heat shield protected it from burning up while it whizzed along at 12,300 miles an hour. About a minute later, the spacecraft deployed a parachute that put on a hefty brake and eventually slowed it to 134 miles an hour. Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator on the InSight lander, stands near a replica of InSight used to simulate the landing weeks ahead of the actual touchdown. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Its heat shield then popped off, and an on-board radar began to search for and ultimately lock onto the ground. At 3,280 feet up, InSight ditched its parachute, performed a short free fall, and then fired a dozen descent engines to eventually slow it to a mere five miles an hour. From atmospheric contact to setting robot legs on the ground, the process took just 6 minutes and 45 seconds. \"It was an incredibly emotional experience,\" Hoffman recounts. \"To get to the point where you have seven more minutes to survive, literally survive, is incredibly hard to describe. My heart ... just stopped beating for seven minutes.\" InSight wasn't the only robot entering Martian airspace for the first time today. Two mini-spacecraft, each about the size of a briefcase, were tagging along as part of the first mission to send tiny spacecraft known as CubeSats into interplanetary space. Collectively known as Mars Cube One, but separately referred to as MarCO-A and MarCO-B, their mission was to collect information from InSight as it descended to the surface, and then relay that information to mission control at JPL. They succeeded not only in doing that, but also in sending back a stark, evocative image of Mars as they departed. \"This is a fantastic day for spacecraft, great and small,\" says JPL's Andrew Klesh. \"This team of really mostly part-timers has proven the technology that we were trying to demonstrate with this mission.\" Now that its solar panels are set up, it's time for InSight to get to work. Over the course of one Martian year, it will do something a bit different from most other Mars missions, which have focused on the planet's flashy rift valleys, mammoth volcanoes, or signs of ancient running water on the surface. Instead, this mission aims to get at the heart of Mars, to measure the size of the planet's core and other interior layers. To do this, it will rely on marsquakes -or tremors that are often produced by the same tectonic activity that crafts those beautiful mountains and valleys. One of InSight's primary goals is to figure out how seismically active Mars is, says Renee Weber of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. How NASA's next Mars mission will take the red planet's pulse \"That is something that we don't actually know,\" she says. \"That's basically how many quakes there are, how often they occur, where do they occur, how big they are.\" Weber suspects that Mars will lie somewhere between Earth and moon in terms of tectonic activity. Parked on the surface, InSight is just waiting to snare those signals. Over the next couple months, it will deploy its instruments, including an exquisitely sensitive seismometer that should detect a variety of marsquakes, both those produced by the planet's own spasms and those resulting from meteor impacts. \"To get all the instruments on the ground is expected to take approximately two to three months,\" says JPL's Elizabeth Barrett. \"I liken it to playing that claw game at a carnival, but you're doing it with a really, really valuable prize, and you're doing it blindfolded where you can only take occasional pictures, and then you're doing it via remote control on another planet.\" After the spacecraft determines the location of a marsquake, it will read the incoming seismic waves and use the information they carry to figure out what types of rock they moved through. As marsquakes rock the planet's innards, they send seismic waves bouncing through the interior, signals that travel just a tiny bit differently depending on what kind of material they're moving through.

But one \"unplanned treat\" is a recording of the wind rolling across the Martian plains - which you can listen to right here. Technically the lander isn't rigged to detect sound, at least in the way you'd do it if you were deliberately trying to record it. But the robotic platform's air pressure sensor and seismometer are both capable of detecting the minute variations as the wind rolls over it. The air pressure sensor, inside that silver dome you see above, produced the most normal-sounding signal, though it still had to be adjusted considerably to be like what you'd hear if you were there. \"The InSight lander acts like a giant ear,\" explained InSight science team member Tom Pike in a NASA news release. \"The solar panels on the lander's sides respond to pressure fluctuations of the wind. It's like InSight is cupping its ears and hearing the Mars wind beating on it.\" Sounds a lot like regular wind, right? Well, what were you expecting? Like so many aspects of space exploration, the prosaic nature of the thing itself - a rock, a landscape feature, a breath of wind - is offset by the fact that it's occurring millions of miles away on an alien world and relayed here by a high- tech robot. Wind on Mars might not sound much different than wind on Earth - but surely that's not the point! If you're curious, the air movement in the recording is a northwesterly one, \"consistent with the direction of dust devil streaks\" in the area. Good to know we can rely on InSight's \"ears\" for that purpose, though its science target is below the surface, not skimming above it. We'll have more recordings soon, I'm sure, so you can use it as noise to fall asleep to. But even better sounds are forthcoming: the Mars 2020 rover will have actual high-quality microphones on board, and will record the sounds of its landing as well as the Martian ambience.

This is the same imaging process used by NASA's Curiosity rover mission, in which many overlapping pictures are taken and later stitched together. Visible in the selfie are the lander's solar panel and its entire deck, including its science instruments. Mission team members have also received their first complete look at InSight's \"workspace\" - the approximately 14-by-7-foot crescent of terrain directly in front of the spacecraft. This image is also a mosaic composed of 52 individual photos. In the coming weeks, scientists and engineers will go through the painstaking process of deciding where in this workspace the spacecraft's instruments should be placed. They will then command InSight's robotic arm to carefully set the seismometer and heat-flow probe in the chosen locations. Both work best on level ground, and engineers want to avoid setting them on rocks larger than about a half-inch. \"The near-absence of rocks, hills and holes means it'll be extremely safe for our instruments,\" said InSight's Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren't on Mars, but we're glad to see that.\" InSight's landing team deliberately chose a landing region in Elysium Planitia that is relatively free of rocks. Even so, the landing spot turned out even better than they hoped. The spacecraft sits in what appears to be a nearly rock-free \"hollow\" - a depression created by a meteor impact that later filled with sand.

New images from the lander show the seismometer on the ground, its copper-colored covering faintly illuminated in the Martian dusk. It looks as if all is calm and all is bright for InSight, heading into the end of the year. \"InSight's timetable of activities on Mars has gone better than we hoped,\" said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman, who is based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Getting the seismometer safely on the ground is an awesome Christmas present.\" The InSight team has been working carefully toward deploying its two dedicated science instruments onto Martian soil since landing on Mars on Nov. 26. Meanwhile, the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, which does not have its own separate instrument, has already begun using InSight's radio connection with Earth to collect preliminary data on the planet's core. Not enough time has elapsed for scientists to deduce what they want to know - scientists estimate they might have some results starting in about a year. To deploy the seismometer and the heat probe, engineers first had to verify the robotic arm that picks up and places InSight's instruments onto the Martian surface was working properly. Engineers tested the commands for the lander, making sure a model in the test bed at JPL deployed the instruments exactly as intended. Scientists also had to analyze images of the Martian terrain around the lander to figure out the best places to deploy the instruments. On Tuesday, Dec. 18, InSight engineers sent up the commands to the spacecraft. On Wednesday, Dec. 19, the seismometer was gently placed onto the ground directly in front of the lander, about as far away as the arm can reach -- 5.367 feet, or 1.636 meters, away. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\" The seismometer allows scientists to peer into the Martian interior by studying ground motion - also known as marsquakes. Each marsquake acts as a kind of flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet's interior. By analyzing how seismic waves pass through the layers of the planet, scientists can deduce the depth and composition of these layers. \"Having the seismometer on the ground is like holding a phone up to your ear,\" said Philippe Lognonn\u00e9, principal investigator of SEIS from Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Paris Diderot University. \"We're thrilled that we're now in the best position to listen to all the seismic waves from below Mars' surface and from its deep interior.\" In the coming days, the InSight team will work on leveling the seismometer, which is sitting on ground that is tilted 2 to 3 degrees. The first seismometer science data should begin to flow back to Earth after the seismometer is in the right position. But engineers and scientists at JPL, the French national space agency Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales and other institutions affiliated with the SEIS team will need several additional weeks to make sure the returned data are as clear as possible. For one thing, they will check and possibly adjust the seismometer's long, wire-lined tether to minimize noise that could travel along it to the seismometer. Then, in early January, engineers expect to command the robotic arm to place the Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer to stabilize the environment around the sensors. Assuming that there are no unexpected issues, the InSight team plans to deploy the heat probe onto the Martian surface by late January. HP3 will be on the east side of the lander's work space, roughly the same distance away from the lander as the seismometer. For now, though, the team is focusing on getting those first bits of seismic data back from the Martian surface. \"We look forward to popping some Champagne when we start to get data from InSight's seismometer on the ground,\" Banerdt added. \"I have a bottle ready for the occasion.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8402/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars/?site=insight"}, {"title": "InSight team creates Martian rock garden, lander begins work", "date": "2018-12-22", "content": "Using tools ranging from rakes and shovels to augmented reality headsets, engineers with NASA's Mars InSight mission have built a Martian rock garden which recreates the lander's new home on Mars. This allows engineers to practice placing science instrument on the surface using InSight's Earth-bound twin - ForeSight. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory built the rock garden based on photos taken by InSight's cameras. The team used rakes and shovels to shape a bed of gravel-like material called garnet, which is used to simulate Martian sand. These Earth-based explorers were able to match the conditions at InSight's landing sight by wearing Microsoft Hololens-augmented reality headsets which projected digital terrain models of the landing site on to the test bed. The perimeter of the area where the two science instruments would be place was marked with wooden blocks and precision cameras in the lab were used to measure each feature they intended to replicate. Building the rock garden, which mimics every detail down to pebbles or rocks larger than one inch took about four hours. Fortunately, a mosaic image of the lander's workspace released last week shows that the area is smooth and mostly rock-free. \"It's great for the science we want to do,\" said JPL's Marleen Sundgaard, who is guiding the test-bed work. \"It's the flat parking lot the landing team promised us. You calculate the probability of rocks in the area and hope the odds are in your favor.\" NASA sent the commands for InSight to set down its seismometer to Mars on Tuesday, Dec. 18. In a few days, Sundgaard and her colleagues will be waiting to see the first images of their work being replicated on Mars. The latest addition to NASA's family of Martian explorers has been as busy as the crew managing it back on the ground has been. The 794 lbs lander was ordered to place the seismometer on Tuesday, Dec. 18, which it completed on the following day right in front of it. Given that the vehicle is stationary it can only move / place things within the length of its arm. With this instrument in place scientists back on Earth should be able to gain a better understanding the \"goings-on\" inside the Red Planet by listening to how the planet moves. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\"", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-centers/jet-propulsion-laboratory/insight-team-creates-martian-rock-garden-lander-begins-work/"}, {"title": "InSight lander deploys seismometer on Mars", "date": "2019-01-15", "content": "The Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure, SEIS, as seen on Jan. 6, 2019.

Due to the ongoing partial U.S. government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, 2018, formal updates on the mission's progress have been scarce.

Despite few formal updates, the mission's website has remained online and been updated periodically. Additionally, the mission's official Twitter account has remained active. On Jan. 6, a GIF was posted on the mission's Twitter feed showing Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure (SEIS) leveling itself as it prepares to record its first measurements. A second GIF was posted on Jan. 7 from raw images acquired on Jan. 3. It showed the power and data tether leading out to SEIS releasing its slack to rest directly on the surface rather than being flexed above the surface as seen during the instrument's initial deployment. Soon, a large domed solar and wind cover, which is currently sitting on the deck of InSight, is planned to be placed on top of the main SEIS instrument to shield it from the elements. SEIS itself was deployed onto the surface on Dec. 19, 2018. The other main instrument awaiting deployment onto the surface is the heat flow probe (HP3), which aims to \"take the temperature of Mars\" by measuring the residual heat being emitted from the planet's interior. Scientists suspect that Mars has a differentiated interior similar to Earth and other terrestrial bodies in the solar system. By measuring the amount of heat radiated from the planet's core, scientists hope to learn if the core is still molten or partially molten and whether Earth and Mars share similar formation histories. It is hoped that the HP3 measurements will help scientists refine models that predict how terrestrial (or rocky) planetary bodies are expected to form while refining our understanding of Earth's interior as well. Unlike the Curiosity or Opportunity rovers that move across the surface, InSight is a stationary lander. Once its instruments are deployed, it will record measurements at the same location during its two-year prime mission. While more detailed updates from NASA are not expected until the end of the government shutdown, the deployment of SEIS and the probable deployment of HP3 in the coming weeks appear to generally be on schedule.

The probe has spent the weeks since its landing in November positioning a seismometer instrument on the surface. Happy with the set-up, scientists have now instructed InSight to put a protective cover over the equipment. The dome will shield the instrument from wind disturbance and swings in temperature. It will give researchers greater confidence in the accuracy of the readings of seismic signals. InSight expects to detect the vibrations from \"Marsquakes\" and meteorite impacts. The data will be used to build a picture of the rock layers inside the Red Planet - from its core to its crust. The instrument - known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) - is led from France, but includes a package of high-frequency sensors (SEIS-SP Short Period) from the UK. This British contribution was developed at Imperial College London, Oxford University and RAL Space. With the seismometer system in position, Nasa controllers will now work on deploying InSight's heat flow probe. This German-led experiment, called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), will be making complementary measurements to the seismometer. HP3 incorporates a \"mole\" to drill down up to 5m below the surface. Its inbuilt sensors will help determine how heat moves through the ground. It is information that will give scientists an idea of how active Mars still is. HP3 is likely to be placed on the surface by InSight's robot arm next week. A third experiment on InSight uses the lander's radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. The Nasa mission landed on Mars on 26 November. Touchdown occurred on flat terrain close to the equator in a region referred to as Elysium Planitia. The mission's experiments will run initially for one Martian year (roughly two Earth years).

That instrument is the heat probe, which, if all goes well, will drill itself about 16 feet into Mars over the course of about two months. The deployment process, like that for the lander's seismometer, relies on the grapple-like claw at the end of InSight's robotic arm. As of yesterday, the claw is grasping the heat probe in preparation for deployment. As the probe burrows into the Martian soil, it will take measurements of how heat flows throughout the planet. That should help scientists understand the properties of Martian regolith. The heat probe will follow its predecessor, the seismometer instrument that will track seismic waves through the interior Mars to try to map its structure. Scientists believe the planet is home to so-called marsquakes, which would create such waves, but the seismometer will also register echoes from meteorite impacts and from the heat probe itself during its drilling process. Scientists have images of the seismometer not only taken by the lander itself, but also as spotted by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the planet since March 2006. One of the instruments on board is a camera called HiRISE, which is able to capture detailed images of the Red Planet's surface. Those images are so detailed that the polygonal solar panels of the lander itself, as well as the white spot of the seismometer's white protective cover, are visible.

InSight, which landed on the Red Planet in November, caught views of one eclipse with its Instrument Deployment Camera on March 5 and the other with its Instrument Context Camera on March 6. Its radiometer also showed a 1 degree Celsius drop in temperature for both short eclipses, as well as a third one. InSight's cameras are essential to setting up and operating its array of instruments that track Mars weather, seismic activity and below-surface heat. While cameras from the Mars spacecraft have captured a Phobos eclipse before - including Curiosity tracking the moon's progress across the sun - this is the first time this type of observation was made with a radiometer. \"The cooling is by about 1 degree C and is thus somewhat larger than expected and certainly better than with the most pessimistic estimates!\" Tilman Spohn, an instrument lead for InSight, said in a blog post from the German space agency DLR. \"So the team is happy and rejoicing about the first eclipse on Mars ever observed with a radiometer.\" Just like meteor impacts with Mars and Marsquakes can help InSight's seismometer learn about the planet's composition, this natural eclipse helped the radiometer learn about the makeup of the material near the planet's surface based on how it conducted the change in heat. \"There is a quantity that scientists call the thermal inertia,\" Spohn said. \"The quantity depends on the thermal conductivity of the near surface material, its density and its heat capacity.\" A small value would lead to a bigger observed effect from the brief eclipse, and would suggest low thermal conductivity or a more porous material. \"The team will now have to analyze the data and come up with a model of the uppermost millimeters or so of the surface material,\" he added. \"So it is part of our efforts to measure the geophysical parameters of Mars.\" InSight deployed its instruments one by one after its landing last year, and it placed its final instrument, a heat probe \"mole,\" on Feb. 12. The mole has since hit a rocky obstacle as it drills itself into the Martian surface, and Spohn said in the blog post that the team has been meeting to figure out next steps for the instrument. The thermal conductivity measurement, as well as measurements from the seismometer as the mole tries to propel itself downward, should help the researchers figure out its exact predicament.

Scientists and project managers, speaking at a pair of briefings Nov. 21 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said there are no issues with the spacecraft, which is on course for a landing at approximately 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars just north of the planet's equator. Rob Grover, the entry, descent and landing lead for the mission, said that since the latest trajectory correction maneuver by the spacecraft Nov. 18, the spacecraft appears to be within about seven kilometers of the planned landing site. \"We're very close right now,\" he said. \"We may not need our last course correction maneuver.\" He said the project will decide by the end of the day Nov. 23 whether that maneuver, which would take place Nov. 25, is needed. Conditions at the landing site appear to be ideal for landing, he noted. The global dust storm that swept across the planet in June, shutting off contact with the Opportunity Mars rover, has long since faded, and there's been no signs of storms in the vicinity of the landing site. \"We're expecting a very plain day on Mars for the landing, and we're very happy about that,\" he said. The Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft will slow down from 5.5 kilometers per second at the beginning of the EDL phase, about 125 kilometers high, to zero in 6.5 minutes, using a combination of a heat shield, parachute and thrusters. The spacecraft will deploy its solar arrays starting 16 minutes after landing, a delay intended to allow dust kicked up by the landing to settle, with the deployment itself taking an additional 16 minutes. NASA hopes to get realtime telemetry of the landing from a pair of cubesats, called Mars Cube One, that launched as secondary payloads with InSight in May and will fly past Mars during the landing. The MarCO cubesats, intended primarily as technology demonstrations, will be able to relay the telemetry from InSight and broadcast it back to Earth. In addition, InSight itself will broadcast a \"beep\" about seven minutes after landing, a signal indicating that it is on the surface. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will be able to provide data with a brief delay, including a first image from the surface taken by the lander. Confirmation that the lander's solar panels are deployed, though, won't come until about five and a half hours after landing, after an overhead pass from the Mars Odyssey orbiter. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy its two major instruments, a French-built seismometer and a German-built heat probe that will burrow several meters into the surface. Project scientists said that process, including scouting the best locations on the ground by the lander to place the instruments, will take several months. \"InSight is kind of a laid-back, slow-motion mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for InSight at JPL. \"It's going to take us probably two to three months, at least, to get our instruments down.\" He estimated it would be \"early next spring\" before those principal instruments started returning data. One of those instruments, the seismometer, suffered development problems that forced the French space agency CNES to redesign it, pushing back InSight's launch from March 2016 to this May. \"At the beginning it was just impossible to build,\" said Philippe Lognonne, project manager for the instrument at CNES. \"But we did it with the help of our partners.\" With those instruments in place, scientists hope to learn more about the interior of Mars and compare it with other terrestrial planets, including the Earth. \"The number one question we want to answer is what's the structure and the energetics of the interior of Mars,\" Banerdt said. That includes the size and density of the planet's core, the thickness of the planet's crust and the structure of the mantle. \"I've personally have been waiting for this information for decades,\" said Sue Smrekar, deputy principal investigator for InSight at JPL, \"and I'm super excited to get this lander on the ground and start taking this data.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-prepares-for-insight-mars-landing/"}, {"title": "InSight to perform final maneuver before landing", "date": "2018-11-25", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft will perform a final maneuver less than 24 hours before its scheduled landing to slightly adjust the location of its landing site. During a briefing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here Nov. 25, project leaders said they decided to carry out a sixth and final trajectory correction maneuver that is part of the cruise phase of the mission. Managers had suggested at a briefing Nov. 21 that, based on the accuracy of the trajectory at that time, they might skip that final maneuver. Tom Hoffman, project manager for InSight, said at the briefing that after the fifth TCM Nov. 18, the center of the landing ellipse, representing the region on the planet the spacecraft would land in, was off its target by about 18 kilometers. That difference was enough for him and other mission officials, at a meeting a few hours before the briefing, to decide to carry out the final maneuver. \"We want to avoid the area up here,\" he said, referring to a region with rougher terrain near the edge of the current landing ellipse. \"That's not a great area to land.\" That maneuver, known as TCM-6 and taking place about 22 hours before the 2:54 p.m. Eastern Nov. 26 landing, will change the spacecraft's velocity by just a few centimeters per second. \"Hopefully within a few hours after that we're going to know exactly where we're landing,\" he said. \"Things should be in good shape.\" The maneuver, he said, is intended to move the center of the landing ellipse back to the target, marked on images with a red X, and avoid the undesirable terrain, a decision that came after what Hoffman called a \"very exciting\" meeting earlier in the day. \"We listened to all the different inputs and the final decision was to go ahead and do the TCM and move ourselves back to that red X,\" he said, \"and be exactly where we really want to land from both a safety standpoint as well as making sure we have the right location for our science instruments.\" Officials said that, other than the decision to perform the final maneuver, there are no issues with the spacecraft, formally known as Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The mission, with a total cost including international contributions of nearly $1 billion, is designed to study the composition and structure of the interior of Mars using a seismometer and heat flow probe. Once on the surface, InSight will deploy those two instruments over the next few months, collecting data on a prime mission scheduled to last two years. \"It feels like a climax,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight at JPL, of the landing, \"but it's actually the beginning.\" He and others involved with the mission expressed a mix of confidence that the spacecraft, based on the Phoenix Mars Lander that successfully landed on Mars a decade ago, would make to the surface, as well as nervousness as the landing approaches. \"I'm actually really confident, personally, that we're going to land safely tomorrow,\" Banerdt said. \"It doesn't mean I'm not nervous.\" \"We recognize that we never take Mars for granted,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science. \"Mars is hard.\" Hoffman noted he spent the Thanksgiving holiday with family, including three young grandsons who, when excited, run around and yell. \"Inside of me right now I'm just about the same,\" he said. As soon as he receives word of a successful landing, he said, \"I'm going to unleash my inner four-year-old.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/insight-to-perform-final-maneuver-before-landing/"}, {"title": "NASA InSight Lander Arrives on Martian Surface", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "Mars has just received its newest robotic resident. NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet after an almost seven-month, 300-million-mile journey from Earth. InSight's two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed. InSight launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5. The lander touched down Monday, Nov. 26, near Mars' equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia, at 11:52:59 a.m. PST. \"Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"InSight will study the interior of Mars and will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars. This accomplishment represents the ingenuity of America and our international partners, and it serves as a testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team. The best of NASA is yet to come, and it is coming soon.\" The landing signal was relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, via NASA's two small experimental Mars Cube One CubeSats, which launched on the same rocket as InSight and followed the lander to Mars. They are the first CubeSats sent into deep space. After successfully carrying out a number of communications and in-flight navigation experiments, the twin MarCOs were set in position to receive transmissions during InSight's entry, descent and landing. \"We hit the Martian atmosphere at 12,300 mph, and the whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes,\" said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"During that short span of time, InSight had to autonomously perform dozens of operations and do them flawlessly - and by all indications that is exactly what our spacecraft did.\" Confirmation of a successful touchdown is not the end of the challenges of landing on the Red Planet. InSight's surface-operations phase began a minute after touchdown. One of its first tasks is to deploy its two decagonal solar arrays, which will provide power. That process begins 16 minutes after landing and takes another 16 minutes to complete. The InSight team expects a confirmation later Monday that the spacecraft's solar panels successfully deployed. Verification will come from NASA's Odyssey spacecraft, currently orbiting Mars. That signal is expected to reach InSight's mission control at JPL about five-and-a-half hours after landing. \"We are solar powered, so getting the arrays out and operating is a big deal,\" said Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"With the arrays providing the energy we need to start the cool science operations, we are well on our way to thoroughly investigate what's inside of Mars for the very first time.\" InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight's instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight's 5.9-foot-long robotic arm so that it can take images of the landscape. \"Landing was thrilling, but I'm looking forward to the drilling,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"When the first images come down, our engineering and science teams will hit the ground running, beginning to plan where to deploy our science instruments. Within two or three months, the arm will deploy the mission's main science instruments, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure and Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instruments.\" InSight will operate on the surface for one Martian year, plus 40 Martian days, or sols, until Nov. 24, 2020. The mission objectives of the two small MarCOs which relayed InSight's telemetry was completed after their Martian flyby. \"That's one giant leap for our intrepid, briefcase-sized robotic explorers,\" said Joel Krajewski, MarCO project manager at JPL. \"I think CubeSats have a big future beyond Earth's orbit, and the MarCO team is happy to trailblaze the way.\" With InSight's landing at Elysium Planitia, NASA has successfully soft-landed a vehicle on the Red Planet eight times. \"Every Mars landing is daunting, but now with InSight safely on the surface we get to do a unique kind of science on Mars,\" said JPL director Michael Watkins. \"The experimental MarCO CubeSats have also opened a new door to smaller planetary spacecraft. The success of these two unique missions is a tribute to the hundreds of talented engineers and scientists who put their genius and labor into making this a great day.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8392/nasa-insight-lander-arrives-on-martian-surface/?site=insight"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight lander touches down on Mars after daring maneuver", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "NASA's InSight spacecraft landed on Mars Monday afternoon, finishing one journey -- through space -- and now launching on another: to go deeper into Mars. The mechanical three-legged, one-armed mining spacecraft landed as planned just before 3 p.m. ET. InSight will be the first mission to drill into the deep interior of Mars as well as investigate if there are \"Marsquakes.\" \"It was tense, you could feel the emotion. It was celebratory with every new information we received,\" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said on a NASA livestream. He said he received a call on his cellphone from a number that was \"all zeroes\" seconds after the landing. It was Vice President Mike Pence. \"He watched the whole thing. He is absolutely ecstatic about our program,\" Bridenstine said. \"He wants me to say congratulations to everyone here at NASA and all of our international partners.\" Pence is chairman of the National Space Council and promotes President Trump's \"Space Force\" plan for a branch of the military in outer space. Dressed in maroon button-down shirts, scientists and engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, could be seen cheering, clapping and hugging after the daring landing. The trip that started seven months and more than 300 million miles ago ended in an anxiety-filled but ultimately smooth last six minutes of entry, descent and landing onto the Martian surface. Jars of peanuts, a good luck token at JPL, were seen throughout the room. \"Flawless. This is what we hoped and imagined in our minds' eye. It looked like it was a very successful and perfect landing,\" Rob Manning, JPL's chief engineer, said minutes after the probe landed. \"The vehicle is nominal. It's happy. The lander is not complaining. We had a way to tell us if it was unhappy, and it wasn't,\" Manning said. It's a normal mode.\" InSight will open its solar panels after it waits for dust to literally clear about four hours after the lander guided itself onto Martian soil. The last several minutes were fraught with anxiety, as technicians braced for any possible scenario. For example, before the parachute deployed, portions of the heat shield became as hot as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We've studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,\" Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a press release. \"Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbor as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.\" InSight marks the first attempt since 2012 for an American spacecraft to visit the red planet. NASA scientists took nothing for granted. On Sunday at 4:47 p.m. ET, engineers were still correcting course \"to steer the spacecraft within a few kilometers of its targeted entry point over Mars,\" NASA said. The monitoring and adjustments to InSight's path continued until the last minute. \"It's taken more than a decade to bring InSight from a concept to a spacecraft approaching Mars - and even longer since I was first inspired to try to undertake this kind of mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"But even after landing, we'll need to be patient for the science to begin.\" ", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/nasas-insight-lander-touch-mars/story?id=59417560"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight Mars lander has touched down. What happens now?", "date": "2018-11-26", "content": "After a 205-day journey through space, NASA's InSight lander is safely on the surface of Mars. Tasked with peering beneath the Martian surface and mapping the planet's underworld, InSight touched down at 2:52 p.m. ET in a sunny patch of boring landscape inside the equatorial plains of Elysium Planitia. Anxious teams of scientists and engineers, clustered together at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, knew the spacecraft had survived its wild and tricky descent to the red planet's surface after receiving data suggesting the lander had touched down safely-followed by an image from InSight itself showing a dusty, alien horizon with a single robot foot. \"It's nice and dirty; I like that,\" says Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. \"This image is actually a really good argument for why you put a dust cover on a camera. Good choice, right?\" After successfully unfurling its solar panels a few hours later, the spacecraft officially became the newest member in an elite fleet of interplanetary robots currently exploring the red planet-including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which monitored InSight's descent. \"I'm very, very happy that it looks like we have an incredibly safe and boring-looking landing plain. That's exactly what we were going for-it's what the landing site selection people promised me,\" says JPL's Tom Hoffman, the InSight project manager. \"They promised me sandy with no rocks. But there's one rock, so I might have to talk with them about that.\" InSight's journey of more than 300 million miles began on May 5 with a foggy, early morning launch from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. Tucked inside its shell, the spacecraft rocketed through the solar system, navigating by starlight as an onboard star tracker helped it stay on course. On November 25 -and then once more, a few hours before touchdown-the spacecraft's entry, descent, and landing team nudged it onto a trajectory that would allow it to bulls-eye in Elysium Planitia. This flat, unremarkable plain was chosen specifically because of the relatively abundant sunlight at the equator and its geologic boringness at the surface, which offers the best chance of finding ideal places to set down its instruments. Once its plunge through the atmosphere was set, the team could only sit back and watch: Without guided entry, InSight had to fly itself to the Martian surface, meaning that a safe landing relied upon correct, preprogrammed commands and on all the necessary onboard instruments functioning properly. \"There are certainly points that will make me smile if they go well,\" Julie Wertz-Chen, an entry, descent, and landing team member, said the week before. As InSight made contact with the planet's thin air, a heat shield protected it from burning up while it whizzed along at 12,300 miles an hour. About a minute later, the spacecraft deployed a parachute that put on a hefty brake and eventually slowed it to 134 miles an hour. Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator on the InSight lander, stands near a replica of InSight used to simulate the landing weeks ahead of the actual touchdown. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Its heat shield then popped off, and an on-board radar began to search for and ultimately lock onto the ground. At 3,280 feet up, InSight ditched its parachute, performed a short free fall, and then fired a dozen descent engines to eventually slow it to a mere five miles an hour. From atmospheric contact to setting robot legs on the ground, the process took just 6 minutes and 45 seconds. \"It was an incredibly emotional experience,\" Hoffman recounts. \"To get to the point where you have seven more minutes to survive, literally survive, is incredibly hard to describe. My heart ... just stopped beating for seven minutes.\" InSight wasn't the only robot entering Martian airspace for the first time today. Two mini-spacecraft, each about the size of a briefcase, were tagging along as part of the first mission to send tiny spacecraft known as CubeSats into interplanetary space. Collectively known as Mars Cube One, but separately referred to as MarCO-A and MarCO-B, their mission was to collect information from InSight as it descended to the surface, and then relay that information to mission control at JPL. They succeeded not only in doing that, but also in sending back a stark, evocative image of Mars as they departed. \"This is a fantastic day for spacecraft, great and small,\" says JPL's Andrew Klesh. \"This team of really mostly part-timers has proven the technology that we were trying to demonstrate with this mission.\" Now that its solar panels are set up, it's time for InSight to get to work. Over the course of one Martian year, it will do something a bit different from most other Mars missions, which have focused on the planet's flashy rift valleys, mammoth volcanoes, or signs of ancient running water on the surface. Instead, this mission aims to get at the heart of Mars, to measure the size of the planet's core and other interior layers. To do this, it will rely on marsquakes -or tremors that are often produced by the same tectonic activity that crafts those beautiful mountains and valleys. One of InSight's primary goals is to figure out how seismically active Mars is, says Renee Weber of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. How NASA's next Mars mission will take the red planet's pulse \"That is something that we don't actually know,\" she says. \"That's basically how many quakes there are, how often they occur, where do they occur, how big they are.\" Weber suspects that Mars will lie somewhere between Earth and moon in terms of tectonic activity. Parked on the surface, InSight is just waiting to snare those signals. Over the next couple months, it will deploy its instruments, including an exquisitely sensitive seismometer that should detect a variety of marsquakes, both those produced by the planet's own spasms and those resulting from meteor impacts. \"To get all the instruments on the ground is expected to take approximately two to three months,\" says JPL's Elizabeth Barrett. \"I liken it to playing that claw game at a carnival, but you're doing it with a really, really valuable prize, and you're doing it blindfolded where you can only take occasional pictures, and then you're doing it via remote control on another planet.\" After the spacecraft determines the location of a marsquake, it will read the incoming seismic waves and use the information they carry to figure out what types of rock they moved through. As marsquakes rock the planet's innards, they send seismic waves bouncing through the interior, signals that travel just a tiny bit differently depending on what kind of material they're moving through.

But one \"unplanned treat\" is a recording of the wind rolling across the Martian plains - which you can listen to right here. Technically the lander isn't rigged to detect sound, at least in the way you'd do it if you were deliberately trying to record it. But the robotic platform's air pressure sensor and seismometer are both capable of detecting the minute variations as the wind rolls over it. The air pressure sensor, inside that silver dome you see above, produced the most normal-sounding signal, though it still had to be adjusted considerably to be like what you'd hear if you were there. \"The InSight lander acts like a giant ear,\" explained InSight science team member Tom Pike in a NASA news release. \"The solar panels on the lander's sides respond to pressure fluctuations of the wind. It's like InSight is cupping its ears and hearing the Mars wind beating on it.\" Sounds a lot like regular wind, right? Well, what were you expecting? Like so many aspects of space exploration, the prosaic nature of the thing itself - a rock, a landscape feature, a breath of wind - is offset by the fact that it's occurring millions of miles away on an alien world and relayed here by a high- tech robot. Wind on Mars might not sound much different than wind on Earth - but surely that's not the point!

We'll have more recordings soon, I'm sure, so you can use it as noise to fall asleep to.

Meanwhile, the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, which does not have its own separate instrument, has already begun using InSight's radio connection with Earth to collect preliminary data on the planet's core. Not enough time has elapsed for scientists to deduce what they want to know - scientists estimate they might have some results starting in about a year. To deploy the seismometer and the heat probe, engineers first had to verify the robotic arm that picks up and places InSight's instruments onto the Martian surface was working properly. Engineers tested the commands for the lander, making sure a model in the test bed at JPL deployed the instruments exactly as intended. Scientists also had to analyze images of the Martian terrain around the lander to figure out the best places to deploy the instruments. On Tuesday, Dec. 18, InSight engineers sent up the commands to the spacecraft. On Wednesday, Dec. 19, the seismometer was gently placed onto the ground directly in front of the lander, about as far away as the arm can reach -- 5.367 feet, or 1.636 meters, away. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\" The seismometer allows scientists to peer into the Martian interior by studying ground motion - also known as marsquakes. Each marsquake acts as a kind of flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet's interior. By analyzing how seismic waves pass through the layers of the planet, scientists can deduce the depth and composition of these layers. \"Having the seismometer on the ground is like holding a phone up to your ear,\" said Philippe Lognonn\u00e9, principal investigator of SEIS from Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Paris Diderot University. \"We're thrilled that we're now in the best position to listen to all the seismic waves from below Mars' surface and from its deep interior.\" In the coming days, the InSight team will work on leveling the seismometer, which is sitting on ground that is tilted 2 to 3 degrees. The first seismometer science data should begin to flow back to Earth after the seismometer is in the right position. But engineers and scientists at JPL, the French national space agency Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales and other institutions affiliated with the SEIS team will need several additional weeks to make sure the returned data are as clear as possible. For one thing, they will check and possibly adjust the seismometer's long, wire-lined tether to minimize noise that could travel along it to the seismometer. Then, in early January, engineers expect to command the robotic arm to place the Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer to stabilize the environment around the sensors. Assuming that there are no unexpected issues, the InSight team plans to deploy the heat probe onto the Martian surface by late January. HP3 will be on the east side of the lander's work space, roughly the same distance away from the lander as the seismometer. For now, though, the team is focusing on getting those first bits of seismic data back from the Martian surface. \"We look forward to popping some Champagne when we start to get data from InSight's seismometer on the ground,\" Banerdt added. \"I have a bottle ready for the occasion.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8402/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars/?site=insight"}, {"title": "InSight team creates Martian rock garden, lander begins work", "date": "2018-12-22", "content": "Using tools ranging from rakes and shovels to augmented reality headsets, engineers with NASA's Mars InSight mission have built a Martian rock garden which recreates the lander's new home on Mars. This allows engineers to practice placing science instrument on the surface using InSight's Earth-bound twin - ForeSight. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory built the rock garden based on photos taken by InSight's cameras. The team used rakes and shovels to shape a bed of gravel-like material called garnet, which is used to simulate Martian sand. These Earth-based explorers were able to match the conditions at InSight's landing sight by wearing Microsoft Hololens-augmented reality headsets which projected digital terrain models of the landing site on to the test bed. The perimeter of the area where the two science instruments would be place was marked with wooden blocks and precision cameras in the lab were used to measure each feature they intended to replicate. Building the rock garden, which mimics every detail down to pebbles or rocks larger than one inch took about four hours. Fortunately, a mosaic image of the lander's workspace released last week shows that the area is smooth and mostly rock-free. \"It's great for the science we want to do,\" said JPL's Marleen Sundgaard, who is guiding the test-bed work. \"It's the flat parking lot the landing team promised us. You calculate the probability of rocks in the area and hope the odds are in your favor.\" NASA sent the commands for InSight to set down its seismometer to Mars on Tuesday, Dec. 18. In a few days, Sundgaard and her colleagues will be waiting to see the first images of their work being replicated on Mars. The latest addition to NASA's family of Martian explorers has been as busy as the crew managing it back on the ground has been. The 794 lbs lander was ordered to place the seismometer on Tuesday, Dec. 18, which it completed on the following day right in front of it. Given that the vehicle is stationary it can only move / place things within the length of its arm. With this instrument in place scientists back on Earth should be able to gain a better understanding the \"goings-on\" inside the Red Planet by listening to how the planet moves. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\"", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-centers/jet-propulsion-laboratory/insight-team-creates-martian-rock-garden-lander-begins-work/"}, {"title": "InSight lander deploys seismometer on Mars", "date": "2019-01-15", "content": "The Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure, SEIS, as seen on Jan. 6, 2019. NASA's InSight Mars lander has been busy getting its suite of instruments prepared for regular use to explore the interior of the Red Planet. The spacecraft, which landed in Elysium Planitia on Nov. 26, 2018, recently deployed and leveled its seismometer to study \"marsquakes.\" A second instrument, the heat flow probe, is waiting for its turn to make a similar trek from the deck of the lander to the surface in the coming weeks. Due to the ongoing partial U.S. government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, 2018, formal updates on the mission's progress have been scarce. However, spacecraft operations have continued as normal thanks in part to the operations budget being previously allocated before the shutdown. Despite few formal updates, the mission's website has remained online and been updated periodically. Additionally, the mission's official Twitter account has remained active. On Jan. 6, a GIF was posted on the mission's Twitter feed showing Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure (SEIS) leveling itself as it prepares to record its first measurements. A second GIF was posted on Jan. 7 from raw images acquired on Jan. 3. It showed the power and data tether leading out to SEIS releasing its slack to rest directly on the surface rather than being flexed above the surface as seen during the instrument's initial deployment. Soon, a large domed solar and wind cover, which is currently sitting on the deck of InSight, is planned to be placed on top of the main SEIS instrument to shield it from the elements. SEIS itself was deployed onto the surface on Dec. 19, 2018. The other main instrument awaiting deployment onto the surface is the heat flow probe (HP3), which aims to \"take the temperature of Mars\" by measuring the residual heat being emitted from the planet's interior. Scientists suspect that Mars has a differentiated interior similar to Earth and other terrestrial bodies in the solar system. By measuring the amount of heat radiated from the planet's core, scientists hope to learn if the core is still molten or partially molten and whether Earth and Mars share similar formation histories. It is hoped that the HP3 measurements will help scientists refine models that predict how terrestrial (or rocky) planetary bodies are expected to form while refining our understanding of Earth's interior as well. Unlike the Curiosity or Opportunity rovers that move across the surface, InSight is a stationary lander. Once its instruments are deployed, it will record measurements at the same location during its two-year prime mission. While more detailed updates from NASA are not expected until the end of the government shutdown, the deployment of SEIS and the probable deployment of HP3 in the coming weeks appear to generally be on schedule.

The probe has spent the weeks since its landing in November positioning a seismometer instrument on the surface. Happy with the set-up, scientists have now instructed InSight to put a protective cover over the equipment. The dome will shield the instrument from wind disturbance and swings in temperature. It will give researchers greater confidence in the accuracy of the readings of seismic signals. InSight expects to detect the vibrations from \"Marsquakes\" and meteorite impacts. The data will be used to build a picture of the rock layers inside the Red Planet - from its core to its crust. The instrument - known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) - is led from France, but includes a package of high-frequency sensors (SEIS-SP Short Period) from the UK. This British contribution was developed at Imperial College London, Oxford University and RAL Space. With the seismometer system in position, Nasa controllers will now work on deploying InSight's heat flow probe. This German-led experiment, called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), will be making complementary measurements to the seismometer. HP3 incorporates a \"mole\" to drill down up to 5m below the surface. Its inbuilt sensors will help determine how heat moves through the ground. It is information that will give scientists an idea of how active Mars still is. HP3 is likely to be placed on the surface by InSight's robot arm next week. A third experiment on InSight uses the lander's radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. The Nasa mission landed on Mars on 26 November.

That instrument is the heat probe, which, if all goes well, will drill itself about 16 feet into Mars over the course of about two months. The deployment process, like that for the lander's seismometer, relies on the grapple-like claw at the end of InSight's robotic arm. As of yesterday, the claw is grasping the heat probe in preparation for deployment. As the probe burrows into the Martian soil, it will take measurements of how heat flows throughout the planet. That should help scientists understand the properties of Martian regolith. The heat probe will follow its predecessor, the seismometer instrument that will track seismic waves through the interior Mars to try to map its structure. Scientists believe the planet is home to so-called marsquakes, which would create such waves, but the seismometer will also register echoes from meteorite impacts and from the heat probe itself during its drilling process. Scientists have images of the seismometer not only taken by the lander itself, but also as spotted by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the planet since March 2006. One of the instruments on board is a camera called HiRISE, which is able to capture detailed images of the Red Planet's surface.

InSight, which landed on the Red Planet in November, caught views of one eclipse with its Instrument Deployment Camera on March 5 and the other with its Instrument Context Camera on March 6. Its radiometer also showed a 1 degree Celsius drop in temperature for both short eclipses, as well as a third one. InSight's cameras are essential to setting up and operating its array of instruments that track Mars weather, seismic activity and below-surface heat. While cameras from the Mars spacecraft have captured a Phobos eclipse before - including Curiosity tracking the moon's progress across the sun - this is the first time this type of observation was made with a radiometer. \"The cooling is by about 1 degree C and is thus somewhat larger than expected and certainly better than with the most pessimistic estimates!\" Tilman Spohn, an instrument lead for InSight, said in a blog post from the German space agency DLR. \"So the team is happy and rejoicing about the first eclipse on Mars ever observed with a radiometer.\" Just like meteor impacts with Mars and Marsquakes can help InSight's seismometer learn about the planet's composition, this natural eclipse helped the radiometer learn about the makeup of the material near the planet's surface based on how it conducted the change in heat. \"There is a quantity that scientists call the thermal inertia,\" Spohn said. \"The quantity depends on the thermal conductivity of the near surface material, its density and its heat capacity.\" A small value would lead to a bigger observed effect from the brief eclipse, and would suggest low thermal conductivity or a more porous material. \"The team will now have to analyze the data and come up with a model of the uppermost millimeters or so of the surface material,\" he added. \"So it is part of our efforts to measure the geophysical parameters of Mars.\" InSight deployed its instruments one by one after its landing last year, and it placed its final instrument, a heat probe \"mole,\" on Feb. 12. The mole has since hit a rocky obstacle as it drills itself into the Martian surface, and Spohn said in the blog post that the team has been meeting to figure out next steps for the instrument. The thermal conductivity measurement, as well as measurements from the seismometer as the mole tries to propel itself downward, should help the researchers figure out its exact predicament.

NASA's InSight lander has detected its first marsquake, a rumbling from the planet's interior, and it may have felt three more. These quakes could help us learn how much water is hiding deep within the planet. InSight landed on Mars in November 2018, and in December it placed a seismometer on the surface to monitor for quakes. On 6 April, it felt the ground shake for the first time. Marsquakes could eventually teach us about the Red Planet's deep interior, including what its mantle, crust, and core are made of and the thickness of each layer. The seismometer is as sensitive as the best instruments we use on Earth and can detect shifts in the ground of less than the thickness of an atom. The 6 April quake was very small, so it didn't provide much insight into the Martian interior. \"In the best station on the Earth, a station which is in a seismic vault deep down, you might be able to detect this quake,\" says Philippe Lognonn\u00e9 at Paris Diderot University, a member of the InSight team. The measurement gave us some basic information about how marsquakes compare to earthquakes. \"The first surprise we got with the marsquake is that it had more similarity to a moonquake than to an earthquake,\" says Lognonn\u00e9. \"On Earth the duration of the signal is a few minutes, on the moon it's closer to an hour, and on Mars it's around ten minutes.\" That's because the rocks on Earth are full of water, which absorbs the shock of seismic activity better than dry ground, shortening the signal. The first marsquake we've detected indicates that the shallow subsurface of Mars does not have much water - far less than Earth - but is not quite as dry as the moon. InSight also detected three even smaller seismic signals in March and April, so weak that even the best detector on Earth would never have been able to spot them. One of these signals may be from wind jostling the seismometer above ground, but the other two seem to be either from marsquakes or from the ground shaking slightly as meteorites hit the surface, Lognonn\u00e9 says.

Mission scientists are still working to confirm the source of the faint trembling, though it appears to have come not from the wind or movement of the lander's robotic arm but from below the Martian surface. If confirmed, it would be the first seismic activity ever detected on Mars. \"We've been collecting background noise up until now, but this first event officially kicks off a new field: Martian seismology!\" Bruce Banerdt, a geologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the principal investigator of the InSight mission, said in a statement. The 800-pound lander is parked on the Elysium Planitia, a broad, mostly rock-free plain just north of the Martian equator. The lander is designed to operate on the surface of Mars for two years, learning about the Martian interior as a way to boost our understanding of the formation of Mars and other rocky worlds, including Mercury, Venus, Earth and the moon. The detection of the marsquake shows that the lander's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure seismometer is working, though the tremor was too small to reveal anything about the Martian interior.

By analyzing how seismic waves pass through the layers of the planet, scientists can deduce the depth and composition of these layers. \"Having the seismometer on the ground is like holding a phone up to your ear,\" said Philippe Lognonn\u00e9, principal investigator of SEIS from Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Paris Diderot University. \"We're thrilled that we're now in the best position to listen to all the seismic waves from below Mars' surface and from its deep interior.\" In the coming days, the InSight team will work on leveling the seismometer, which is sitting on ground that is tilted 2 to 3 degrees. The first seismometer science data should begin to flow back to Earth after the seismometer is in the right position. But engineers and scientists at JPL, the French national space agency Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales and other institutions affiliated with the SEIS team will need several additional weeks to make sure the returned data are as clear as possible. For one thing, they will check and possibly adjust the seismometer's long, wire-lined tether to minimize noise that could travel along it to the seismometer. Then, in early January, engineers expect to command the robotic arm to place the Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer to stabilize the environment around the sensors. Assuming that there are no unexpected issues, the InSight team plans to deploy the heat probe onto the Martian surface by late January. HP3 will be on the east side of the lander's work space, roughly the same distance away from the lander as the seismometer. For now, though, the team is focusing on getting those first bits of seismic data back from the Martian surface. \"We look forward to popping some Champagne when we start to get data from InSight's seismometer on the ground,\" Banerdt added. \"I have a bottle ready for the occasion.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8402/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars/?site=insight"}, {"title": "InSight team creates Martian rock garden, lander begins work", "date": "2018-12-22", "content": "Using tools ranging from rakes and shovels to augmented reality headsets, engineers with NASA's Mars InSight mission have built a Martian rock garden which recreates the lander's new home on Mars. This allows engineers to practice placing science instrument on the surface using InSight's Earth-bound twin - ForeSight. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory built the rock garden based on photos taken by InSight's cameras. The team used rakes and shovels to shape a bed of gravel-like material called garnet, which is used to simulate Martian sand. These Earth-based explorers were able to match the conditions at InSight's landing sight by wearing Microsoft Hololens-augmented reality headsets which projected digital terrain models of the landing site on to the test bed. The perimeter of the area where the two science instruments would be place was marked with wooden blocks and precision cameras in the lab were used to measure each feature they intended to replicate. Building the rock garden, which mimics every detail down to pebbles or rocks larger than one inch took about four hours. Fortunately, a mosaic image of the lander's workspace released last week shows that the area is smooth and mostly rock-free. \"It's great for the science we want to do,\" said JPL's Marleen Sundgaard, who is guiding the test-bed work. \"It's the flat parking lot the landing team promised us. You calculate the probability of rocks in the area and hope the odds are in your favor.\" NASA sent the commands for InSight to set down its seismometer to Mars on Tuesday, Dec. 18. In a few days, Sundgaard and her colleagues will be waiting to see the first images of their work being replicated on Mars. The latest addition to NASA's family of Martian explorers has been as busy as the crew managing it back on the ground has been. The 794 lbs lander was ordered to place the seismometer on Tuesday, Dec. 18, which it completed on the following day right in front of it. Given that the vehicle is stationary it can only move / place things within the length of its arm. With this instrument in place scientists back on Earth should be able to gain a better understanding the \"goings-on\" inside the Red Planet by listening to how the planet moves. \"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\"", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-centers/jet-propulsion-laboratory/insight-team-creates-martian-rock-garden-lander-begins-work/"}, {"title": "InSight lander deploys seismometer on Mars", "date": "2019-01-15", "content": "The Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure, SEIS, as seen on Jan. 6, 2019.

Due to the ongoing partial U.S. government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, 2018, formal updates on the mission's progress have been scarce. However, spacecraft operations have continued as normal thanks in part to the operations budget being previously allocated before the shutdown. Despite few formal updates, the mission's website has remained online and been updated periodically. Additionally, the mission's official Twitter account has remained active. On Jan. 6, a GIF was posted on the mission's Twitter feed showing Seismic Explorations for Interior Structure (SEIS) leveling itself as it prepares to record its first measurements. A second GIF was posted on Jan. 7 from raw images acquired on Jan. 3. It showed the power and data tether leading out to SEIS releasing its slack to rest directly on the surface rather than being flexed above the surface as seen during the instrument's initial deployment. Soon, a large domed solar and wind cover, which is currently sitting on the deck of InSight, is planned to be placed on top of the main SEIS instrument to shield it from the elements. SEIS itself was deployed onto the surface on Dec. 19, 2018. The other main instrument awaiting deployment onto the surface is the heat flow probe (HP3), which aims to \"take the temperature of Mars\" by measuring the residual heat being emitted from the planet's interior. Scientists suspect that Mars has a differentiated interior similar to Earth and other terrestrial bodies in the solar system. By measuring the amount of heat radiated from the planet's core, scientists hope to learn if the core is still molten or partially molten and whether Earth and Mars share similar formation histories. It is hoped that the HP3 measurements will help scientists refine models that predict how terrestrial (or rocky) planetary bodies are expected to form while refining our understanding of Earth's interior as well. Unlike the Curiosity or Opportunity rovers that move across the surface, InSight is a stationary lander. Once its instruments are deployed, it will record measurements at the same location during its two-year prime mission. While more detailed updates from NASA are not expected until the end of the government shutdown, the deployment of SEIS and the probable deployment of HP3 in the coming weeks appear to generally be on schedule.

Its radiometer also showed a 1 degree Celsius drop in temperature for both short eclipses, as well as a third one. InSight's cameras are essential to setting up and operating its array of instruments that track Mars weather, seismic activity and below-surface heat.

NASA's InSight lander has detected its first marsquake, a rumbling from the planet's interior, and it may have felt three more. These quakes could help us learn how much water is hiding deep within the planet. InSight landed on Mars in November 2018, and in December it placed a seismometer on the surface to monitor for quakes. On 6 April, it felt the ground shake for the first time. Marsquakes could eventually teach us about the Red Planet's deep interior, including what its mantle, crust, and core are made of and the thickness of each layer. The seismometer is as sensitive as the best instruments we use on Earth and can detect shifts in the ground of less than the thickness of an atom. The 6 April quake was very small, so it didn't provide much insight into the Martian interior. \"In the best station on the Earth, a station which is in a seismic vault deep down, you might be able to detect this quake,\" says Philippe Lognonn\u00e9 at Paris Diderot University, a member of the InSight team. The measurement gave us some basic information about how marsquakes compare to earthquakes. \"The first surprise we got with the marsquake is that it had more similarity to a moonquake than to an earthquake,\" says Lognonn\u00e9. \"On Earth the duration of the signal is a few minutes, on the moon it's closer to an hour, and on Mars it's around ten minutes.\" That's because the rocks on Earth are full of water, which absorbs the shock of seismic activity better than dry ground, shortening the signal. The first marsquake we've detected indicates that the shallow subsurface of Mars does not have much water - far less than Earth - but is not quite as dry as the moon. InSight also detected three even smaller seismic signals in March and April, so weak that even the best detector on Earth would never have been able to spot them. One of these signals may be from wind jostling the seismometer above ground, but the other two seem to be either from marsquakes or from the ground shaking slightly as meteorites hit the surface, Lognonn\u00e9 says.

NASA's InSight lander, which touched down on Mars in November after a seven-month journey, sensed the seismic signal on April 6, the space agency said Tuesday. Mission scientists are still working to confirm the source of the faint trembling, though it appears to have come not from the wind or movement of the lander's robotic arm but from below the Martian surface. If confirmed, it would be the first seismic activity ever detected on Mars. \"We've been collecting background noise up until now, but this first event officially kicks off a new field: Martian seismology!\" Bruce Banerdt, a geologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the principal investigator of the InSight mission, said in a statement. The 800-pound lander is parked on the Elysium Planitia, a broad, mostly rock-free plain just north of the Martian equator. The lander is designed to operate on the surface of Mars for two years, learning about the Martian interior as a way to boost our understanding of the formation of Mars and other rocky worlds, including Mercury, Venus, Earth and the moon. The detection of the marsquake shows that the lander's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure seismometer is working, though the tremor was too small to reveal anything about the Martian interior. But mission scientists expect the lander to detect more - and bigger - quakes. \"We expect to get one quake larger by a factor 10 approximately every 5-10 quakes,\" Philippe Lognonn\u00e9, a professor of geophysics and planetary science at the University of Paris Diderot and the leader of the seismometer team, said in an email. \"These larger quakes will be those enabling us to make the full science we want to make on the internal structure, and which will tell us the crust thickness and core size.

The thermal conductivity measurement, as well as measurements from the seismometer as the mole tries to propel itself downward, should help the researchers figure out its exact predicament.

The deployment process, like that for the lander's seismometer, relies on the grapple-like claw at the end of InSight's robotic arm. As of yesterday, the claw is grasping the heat probe in preparation for deployment. As the probe burrows into the Martian soil, it will take measurements of how heat flows throughout the planet. That should help scientists understand the properties of Martian regolith. The heat probe will follow its predecessor, the seismometer instrument that will track seismic waves through the interior Mars to try to map its structure. Scientists believe the planet is home to so-called marsquakes, which would create such waves, but the seismometer will also register echoes from meteorite impacts and from the heat probe itself during its drilling process. Scientists have images of the seismometer not only taken by the lander itself, but also as spotted by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the planet since March 2006. One of the instruments on board is a camera called HiRISE, which is able to capture detailed images of the Red Planet's surface.

Here's What We Know", "date": "2019-07-25", "content": "There are at least two different types of marsquakes, new research suggests. Seismologists at ETH Zurich recently re-created Red Planet temblors in the Swiss university's quake simulator, using measurements of two real marsquakes made by the supersensitive seismometers aboard NASA's Mars InSight lander. The actual marsquakes InSight observed were faint and distant, so the scientists amplified the signals by a factor of 10 million to observe the effects in the lab. And the researchers were able to figure some things out even from this small dataset. \"We are currently observing two families of quakes on Mars,\" Simon St\u00e4hler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich's Marsquake Service, said in a statement. \"The first quake was a high-frequency event more similar to a moonquake than we expected,\" he added. \"The second quake was a much lower frequency, and we think this may be due to the distance. The lower-frequency quake likely occurred further away from the seismometer. Compared to the duration of earthquakes, both types of the marsquakes last longer.\" Scientists have been able to characterize moonquakes thanks to seismometers placed on the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts. Moonquakes can last for an hour or more, far longer than temblors on Earth, which typically last just a few minutes at most. This duration disparity is caused primarily by the much higher water content in Earth rocks, according to lunar scientist Clive Neal of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. \"Water weakens stone, expanding the structure of different minerals. When energy propagates across such a compressible structure, it acts like a foam sponge - it deadens the vibrations,\" Neal said back in 2006. When a quake shakes dry moon rocks, by contrast, \"it just keeps going and going,\" he added. There are other key quake differences between the two worlds as well. For example, Earth's crust is much more homogeneous than that of the moon, because our planet's active geology tends to meld everything together. On the geologically dead moon, by contrast, fractures caused by meteorite impacts persist for eons. That can make it tough to trace a moonquake to its source. \"The heterogeneous lunar crust scatters seismic waves, similar to the reverberating echoes one might experience when calling out in rugged mountain terrain,\" John Clinton, who leads operations at ETH Zurich's Marsquake Service, said in the same statement. Scientists don't yet have a great read on marsquakes; InSight has detected only a couple to date, after all. But the early analyses suggest that Red Planet temblors may be fall between those of the moon and Earth on the quake spectrum, ETH Zurich researchers said. For example, marsquakes appear to last from 10 minutes to 20 minutes. The $800 million InSight mission landed near the Martian equator in November 2018 to map the Red Planet's interior in unprecedented detail. The seismometer suite, known as SEIS, was provided by the French space agency, CNES. ETH Zurich was a contributor to the SEIS. InSight's other major instrument, a burrowing heat probe dubbed \"the mole,\" has encountered some difficulty. The mole was supposed to bury itself at least 10 feet underground, but it got stuck about 12 inches down. Mission team members are trying to figure out what happened and how to get the mole on its way again.

Here's What We Know", "date": "2019-07-25", "content": "There are at least two different types of marsquakes, new research suggests. Seismologists at ETH Zurich recently re-created Red Planet temblors in the Swiss university's quake simulator, using measurements of two real marsquakes made by the supersensitive seismometers aboard NASA's Mars InSight lander. The actual marsquakes InSight observed were faint and distant, so the scientists amplified the signals by a factor of 10 million to observe the effects in the lab. And the researchers were able to figure some things out even from this small dataset. \"We are currently observing two families of quakes on Mars,\" Simon St\u00e4hler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich's Marsquake Service, said in a statement. \"The first quake was a high-frequency event more similar to a moonquake than we expected,\" he added. \"The second quake was a much lower frequency, and we think this may be due to the distance. The lower-frequency quake likely occurred further away from the seismometer. Compared to the duration of earthquakes, both types of the marsquakes last longer.\" Scientists have been able to characterize moonquakes thanks to seismometers placed on the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts. Moonquakes can last for an hour or more, far longer than temblors on Earth, which typically last just a few minutes at most. This duration disparity is caused primarily by the much higher water content in Earth rocks, according to lunar scientist Clive Neal of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. \"Water weakens stone, expanding the structure of different minerals. When energy propagates across such a compressible structure, it acts like a foam sponge - it deadens the vibrations,\" Neal said back in 2006. When a quake shakes dry moon rocks, by contrast, \"it just keeps going and going,\" he added. There are other key quake differences between the two worlds as well. For example, Earth's crust is much more homogeneous than that of the moon, because our planet's active geology tends to meld everything together. On the geologically dead moon, by contrast, fractures caused by meteorite impacts persist for eons. That can make it tough to trace a moonquake to its source. \"The heterogeneous lunar crust scatters seismic waves, similar to the reverberating echoes one might experience when calling out in rugged mountain terrain,\" John Clinton, who leads operations at ETH Zurich's Marsquake Service, said in the same statement. Scientists don't yet have a great read on marsquakes; InSight has detected only a couple to date, after all. But the early analyses suggest that Red Planet temblors may be fall between those of the moon and Earth on the quake spectrum, ETH Zurich researchers said. For example, marsquakes appear to last from 10 minutes to 20 minutes. The $800 million InSight mission landed near the Martian equator in November 2018 to map the Red Planet's interior in unprecedented detail. The seismometer suite, known as SEIS, was provided by the French space agency, CNES. ETH Zurich was a contributor to the SEIS. InSight's other major instrument, a burrowing heat probe dubbed \"the mole,\" has encountered some difficulty. The mole was supposed to bury itself at least 10 feet underground, but it got stuck about 12 inches down. Mission team members are trying to figure out what happened and how to get the mole on its way again.

Scientists and engineers involved with InSight's Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument have been working for the last several months to get the instrument's probe, or \"mole,\" to start moving into the surface again. The mole, intended to hammer to a depth of five meters below the surface, stopped in early March only about 30 centimeters below the surface. In June, the mission decided to use the lander's robotic arm to remove the support structure for the instrument. That would allow the instrument team to get a better view of the condition of the mole and also take new steps to get the mole moving again. Scientists believed that a lack of friction with the surrounding regolith was preventing the mole from gaining traction as it attempted to hammer deeper into the surface. Removal of the support structure confirmed that hypothesis. Images showed the top of the mole peeking out above the surface in a hole about twice the diameter of the mole. A twist in the tether linking the mole to the rest of the instrument suggested it had started to spin around, widening the hole, as it tried to hammer deeper into the surface. The instrument team then used InSight's robotic arm again, pressing the scoop at the end of arm against the surface around the hole to try and collapse it. In an Aug. 27 blog post, Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the instrument at the German space agency DLR, said that images taken after those attempts showed that the pit was only, at best, partially collapsed on one side. Spohn said it appears there is a layer of \"duricrust,\" or regolith that is mechanically strong, on the surface, covered by about a centimeter of loose dust. Below that duricrust, which he estimated to be five to ten centimeters thick, could be \"cohesionless sand\" that prevents the mole from penetrating. InSight is currently on hiatus while it and other spacecraft at Mars are in solar conjunction, with the sun between Mars and the Earth blocking communications. Spohn said that while the break is a time for some to take a vacation, he and others are thinking about new ways to get the mole moving again. One possibility would be to use the scoop on the robotic arm in a different way. \"I am thinking towards pinning the mole with the scoop such that the pinning and the pressing of the mole against the wall of the pit would increase friction,\" he wrote. \"This will be more risky than the previous strategy, but with the unexpectedly stiff duricrust, it may be worth a try.\" Spohn didn't state when the mission would try a new approach to get the mole moving again. Andrew Good, a spokesman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said Aug. 29 that there will be no action immediately after the solar conjunction period ends Sept. 7. It will take about a week after that to get all the data back from InSight and other spacecraft at Mars. \"Even after that, the team is continuing to conduct testing and discuss the next move,\" he said, and thus there is no firm date for deciding what to do next with the mole.

NASA's InSight lander has detected its first marsquake, a rumbling from the planet's interior, and it may have felt three more. These quakes could help us learn how much water is hiding deep within the planet. InSight landed on Mars in November 2018, and in December it placed a seismometer on the surface to monitor for quakes. On 6 April, it felt the ground shake for the first time. Marsquakes could eventually teach us about the Red Planet's deep interior, including what its mantle, crust, and core are made of and the thickness of each layer. The seismometer is as sensitive as the best instruments we use on Earth and can detect shifts in the ground of less than the thickness of an atom. The 6 April quake was very small, so it didn't provide much insight into the Martian interior. \"In the best station on the Earth, a station which is in a seismic vault deep down, you might be able to detect this quake,\" says Philippe Lognonn\u00e9 at Paris Diderot University, a member of the InSight team. The measurement gave us some basic information about how marsquakes compare to earthquakes. \"The first surprise we got with the marsquake is that it had more similarity to a moonquake than to an earthquake,\" says Lognonn\u00e9. \"On Earth the duration of the signal is a few minutes, on the moon it's closer to an hour, and on Mars it's around ten minutes.\" That's because the rocks on Earth are full of water, which absorbs the shock of seismic activity better than dry ground, shortening the signal. The first marsquake we've detected indicates that the shallow subsurface of Mars does not have much water - far less than Earth - but is not quite as dry as the moon. InSight also detected three even smaller seismic signals in March and April, so weak that even the best detector on Earth would never have been able to spot them. One of these signals may be from wind jostling the seismometer above ground, but the other two seem to be either from marsquakes or from the ground shaking slightly as meteorites hit the surface, Lognonn\u00e9 says.

But, the reason behind this is currently not known. This is among the preliminary findings of NASA's InSight lander, the National Geographic reported. According to The Indian Express, ever since it landed on the red planet last year in November, the InSight lander has been collecting various information that will help space scientists understand our neighbouring planet better. According to the revelations during a meeting of European Planetary Science Congress and the American Astronomical Society, the magnetic fields of Mars are \"quite strange and odd.\" In addition to the strange magnetic pulse, the data from the lander also revealed that Mar's crust is way more magnetic than what space scientists had expected. The InSight mission has also picked up a peculiar electrically conductive layer, that is around 2.5 miles thick and deep beneath the surface of the red planet. There might be a chance that this particular layer might represent a reservoir of liquid water, however, it is too early to be certain about it, the report said. InSight seems to have found an electrically conductive layer almost 62 miles below the surface of Mars, looking quite similar to how water that is deep under the Earth's crust appears when we use terrestrial magnetometers, The Indian Express reported. In our own planet, the groundwater is locked under the soil and rocks. In case a similar groundwater resource is found on the neighbouring planet then it should not be surprising, the report said quoting Jani Radebaugh, a planetary scientist at Brigham Young University. If indeed there is water in such a large region then it implies that there is potential for life, past or present. At the moment, none of the data have gone through peer review and the details of the initial findings and interpretations will get tweaked over the period of time, the report said.

InSight landed on Mars in November 2018 and placed the seismometer on the Martian surface in February. But the Red Planet didn't produce any sounds until April. And even then, something strange happened. It's a seismic signal that was recorded April 6, and by all indications, the InSight team believes this sound is a quake from within the planet rather than something on the surface. But the signal was at a high frequency and nothing like it has been produced since. InSight has detected more than 100 events since April and the researchers estimate 21 of them could be quakes. NASA shared some recordings of rumblings captured in May and July. Both occurred below the human range of hearing, but were processed so we could hear them. The May quake had a magnitude of 3.7 and the July quake reached 3.3 Mars doesn't have tectonic plates, which are the cause of quakes on Earth. Martian quakes are caused by cooling and contraction, which create stress fractures on the crust. NASA just heard the first sounds of wind on Mars.

Wind picks up during the day, so it's easier for the researchers to listen out for quakes at night. But nightfall comes with its own unique sounds. The InSight researchers call them \" dinks and donks \" - the expansion and contraction of parts inside the seismometer, possibly due to heat loss. In one of the sound samples, a strange whistling can also be heard. The researchers think there is interference with the electronics in the seismometer.

Known as \"the mole,\" the probe has been unable to dig more than about 14 inches since it began burying itself into the ground on February 28, 2019. The maneuver is in preparation for a tactic, to be tried over several weeks, called \"pinning.\" \"We're going to try pressing the side of the scoop against the mole, pinning it to the wall of its hole,\" said InSight Deputy Principal Investigator Sue Smrekar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might increase friction enough to keep it moving forward when mole hammering resumes.\" Whether the extra pressure on the mole will compensate for the unique soil remains an unknown. Designed to burrow as much as 16 feet underground to record the amount of heat escaping from the planet's interior, the mole needs friction from surrounding soil in order to dig: Without it, recoil from the self- hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place, which is what the mission team suspects is happening now. While JPL manages the InSight mission for NASA, the German Aerospace Center provided the heat probe, which is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package. Back in June, the team devised a plan to help the heat probe. The mole wasn't designed to be picked up and relocated once it begins digging. Instead, the robotic arm removed a support structure intended to hold the mole steady as it digs into the Martian surface. NASA InSight's robotic arm will use its scoop to pin the spacecraft's heat probe, or \"mole,\" against the wall of its hole. The mole is part of an instrument formally called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, provided by the German Aerospace Center. Removing the structure allowed the InSight team to get a better look at the hole that formed around the mole as it hammered. It's possible that the mole has hit a rock, but testing by DLR suggested the issue was soil that clumps together rather than falling around the mole as it hammers. Sure enough, the arm's camera discovered that below the surface appears to be 2 to 4 inches of duricrust, a kind of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions and different from the soil the mole was designed for. \"All we know about the soil is what we can see in images InSight sends us,\" said Tilman Spohn, HP3's principal investigator at DLR. \"Since we can't bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.\" Using a scoop on the robotic arm, the team poked and pushed the soil seven times over the summer in an effort to collapse the hole. No such luck. It shouldn't take much force to collapse the hole, but the arm isn't pushing at full strength. The team placed HP3 as far from the lander as possible so that the spacecraft's shadow wouldn't influence the heat probe's temperature readings. As a result, the arm, which wasn't intended to be used this way, has to stretch out and press at an angle, exerting much less force than if the mole were closer. \"We're asking the arm to punch above its weight,\" said Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, the lead arm engineer at JPL. \"The arm can't push the soil the way a person can. This would be easier if it could, but that's just not the arm we have.\" Interplanetary rescue operations aren't new to NASA. The Mars Exploration Rover team helped save Spirit and Opportunity on more than one occasion. Coming up with workable solutions requires an extraordinary amount of patience and planning. JPL has a working replica of InSight to practice arm movements, and it has a working model of the heat probe as well. Besides pinning, the team is also testing a technique to use the scoop in the way it was originally intended to work: scraping soil into the hole rather than trying to compress it. Both techniques might be visible to the public in raw images that come down from InSight in the near future.

It was designed to reach at least 16 feet beneath the surface to record how heat escapes from the interior, according to NASA. The mole seems to be missing a key factor in digging: friction in the surrounding soil. Instead, the team believes that the probe is simply bouncing in place. Applying extra pressure may be a solution. \"We're going to try pressing the side of the scoop against the mole, pinning it to the wall of its hole,\" said Sue Smrekar, InSight deputy principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might increase friction enough to keep it moving forward when mole hammering resumes.\" Relocating the mole isn't the solution because it wasn't designed to be moved once it began digging. The mole, known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, was provided by the German Aerospace Center. In June, the experiment's team used the spacecraft's robotic arm to remove a structure keeping the mole steady so they could get a more direct view of what happened when the mole tried to dig. A camera on the arm revealed between two to four inches of duricrust beneath the surface. Duricrust is a hard crust at or near the surface of the ground typically formed by the accumulation of upward migration and evaporation of ground water. This soil that seems cemented together is thicker than what the mole was designed for. And it's nothing like the soil that previous Mars missions have run into before. \"All we know about the soil is what we can see in images InSight sends us,\" said Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the experiment. \"Since we can't bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.\" Over the last few months, the team used a scoop on the robotic arm to push and poke at the soil, hoping it would collapse the soil. But the arm can't use its full strength to push. This is because the mole is as far away as it can be from the spacecraft so it wouldn't lead to false temperature readings. \"We're asking the arm to punch above its weight,\" said Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, the lead arm engineer at JPL. \"The arm can't push the soil the way a person can.

The burrowing heat probe aboard NASA's InSight Mars lander was originally supposed to dig 10 to 16 feet beneath the planet's red dirt, using a self-hammering tool called \"the mole.\" Shortly after deploying onto the Martian surface in February, however, the instrument became stuck about 1 foot down. Earlier this month, InSight team members announced that they'd managed to get the mole moving again by pinning it down with the lander's robotic arm. The breakthrough suggested that the digger had previously lost friction with the dirt, perhaps as a consequence of Mars soil's weird properties, rather than having run up against a big buried rock. This sequence of images shows the burrowing heat probe on NASA's InSight Mars lander popping back out of the hole it had dug on the Red Planet. But that downward progress was short-lived. The mole has backed about halfway out of its burrow, mission team members announced yesterday. \"Preliminary assessments point to unusual soil conditions on the Red Planet. The international mission team is developing the next steps to get it buried again,\" NASA officials wrote in an update yesterday. \"The next step is determining how safe it is to move InSight's robotic arm away from the mole to better assess the situation,\" they added. \"The team continues to look at the data and will formulate a plan in the next few days.\" The heat probe, officially called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, was provided by the German Aerospace Center.

Seismologists at ETH Zurich recently re-created Red Planet temblors in the Swiss university's quake simulator, using measurements of two real marsquakes made by the supersensitive seismometers aboard NASA's Mars InSight lander. The actual marsquakes InSight observed were faint and distant, so the scientists amplified the signals by a factor of 10 million to observe the effects in the lab. And the researchers were able to figure some things out even from this small dataset. \"We are currently observing two families of quakes on Mars,\" Simon St\u00e4hler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich's Marsquake Service, said in a statement. \"The first quake was a high-frequency event more similar to a moonquake than we expected,\" he added. \"The second quake was a much lower frequency, and we think this may be due to the distance. The lower-frequency quake likely occurred further away from the seismometer. Compared to the duration of earthquakes, both types of the marsquakes last longer.\" Scientists have been able to characterize moonquakes thanks to seismometers placed on the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts. Moonquakes can last for an hour or more, far longer than temblors on Earth, which typically last just a few minutes at most. This duration disparity is caused primarily by the much higher water content in Earth rocks, according to lunar scientist Clive Neal of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. \"Water weakens stone, expanding the structure of different minerals. When energy propagates across such a compressible structure, it acts like a foam sponge - it deadens the vibrations,\" Neal said back in 2006.

The burrowing heat probe aboard NASA's InSight Mars lander was originally supposed to dig 10 to 16 feet beneath the planet's red dirt, using a self-hammering tool called \"the mole.\" Shortly after deploying onto the Martian surface in February, however, the instrument became stuck about 1 foot down. Earlier this month, InSight team members announced that they'd managed to get the mole moving again by pinning it down with the lander's robotic arm. The breakthrough suggested that the digger had previously lost friction with the dirt, perhaps as a consequence of Mars soil's weird properties, rather than having run up against a big buried rock. This sequence of images shows the burrowing heat probe on NASA's InSight Mars lander popping back out of the hole it had dug on the Red Planet. But that downward progress was short-lived. The mole has backed about halfway out of its burrow, mission team members announced yesterday. \"Preliminary assessments point to unusual soil conditions on the Red Planet. The international mission team is developing the next steps to get it buried again,\" NASA officials wrote in an update yesterday. \"The next step is determining how safe it is to move InSight's robotic arm away from the mole to better assess the situation,\" they added. \"The team continues to look at the data and will formulate a plan in the next few days.\" The heat probe, officially called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, was provided by the German Aerospace Center. HP3 is one of InSight's two main science instruments. The other is a suite of supersensitive seismometers that were provided by the French space agency CNES and its partners, which are measuring and characterizing marsquakes. The data gathered by InSight, which touched down near the Martian equator in November 2018, will help scientists to construct a detailed 3D map of the Red Planet's interior. This information, in turn, should reveal a great deal about the formation and evolution of rocky planets in general, NASA officials have said. The seismometers have detected 150 events to date, 23 of which have already been confirmed as marsquakes, InSight project manager Tom Hoffman, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said earlier this month during a presentation at the 22nd Annual International Mars Society Convention in Los Angeles. \"The Insight mission overall is functioning very well,\" Zurbuchen said via Twitter yesterday. \"Remember that, even though the international team will continue to do their best to get this mole into the ground, the mole working is not a so-called Level 1 for mission success,\" he added in another tweet.

Here's What We Know", "date": "2019-07-25", "content": "There are at least two different types of marsquakes, new research suggests. Seismologists at ETH Zurich recently re-created Red Planet temblors in the Swiss university's quake simulator, using measurements of two real marsquakes made by the supersensitive seismometers aboard NASA's Mars InSight lander. The actual marsquakes InSight observed were faint and distant, so the scientists amplified the signals by a factor of 10 million to observe the effects in the lab. And the researchers were able to figure some things out even from this small dataset. \"We are currently observing two families of quakes on Mars,\" Simon St\u00e4hler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich's Marsquake Service, said in a statement. \"The first quake was a high-frequency event more similar to a moonquake than we expected,\" he added. \"The second quake was a much lower frequency, and we think this may be due to the distance. The lower-frequency quake likely occurred further away from the seismometer. Compared to the duration of earthquakes, both types of the marsquakes last longer.\" Scientists have been able to characterize moonquakes thanks to seismometers placed on the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts. Moonquakes can last for an hour or more, far longer than temblors on Earth, which typically last just a few minutes at most. This duration disparity is caused primarily by the much higher water content in Earth rocks, according to lunar scientist Clive Neal of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. \"Water weakens stone, expanding the structure of different minerals. When energy propagates across such a compressible structure, it acts like a foam sponge - it deadens the vibrations,\" Neal said back in 2006. When a quake shakes dry moon rocks, by contrast, \"it just keeps going and going,\" he added. There are other key quake differences between the two worlds as well. For example, Earth's crust is much more homogeneous than that of the moon, because our planet's active geology tends to meld everything together. On the geologically dead moon, by contrast, fractures caused by meteorite impacts persist for eons. That can make it tough to trace a moonquake to its source. \"The heterogeneous lunar crust scatters seismic waves, similar to the reverberating echoes one might experience when calling out in rugged mountain terrain,\" John Clinton, who leads operations at ETH Zurich's Marsquake Service, said in the same statement. Scientists don't yet have a great read on marsquakes; InSight has detected only a couple to date, after all. But the early analyses suggest that Red Planet temblors may be fall between those of the moon and Earth on the quake spectrum, ETH Zurich researchers said. For example, marsquakes appear to last from 10 minutes to 20 minutes. The $800 million InSight mission landed near the Martian equator in November 2018 to map the Red Planet's interior in unprecedented detail. The seismometer suite, known as SEIS, was provided by the French space agency, CNES. ETH Zurich was a contributor to the SEIS. InSight's other major instrument, a burrowing heat probe dubbed \"the mole,\" has encountered some difficulty. The mole was supposed to bury itself at least 10 feet underground, but it got stuck about 12 inches down. Mission team members are trying to figure out what happened and how to get the mole on its way again.

Scientists and engineers involved with InSight's Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument have been working for the last several months to get the instrument's probe, or \"mole,\" to start moving into the surface again. The mole, intended to hammer to a depth of five meters below the surface, stopped in early March only about 30 centimeters below the surface. In June, the mission decided to use the lander's robotic arm to remove the support structure for the instrument. That would allow the instrument team to get a better view of the condition of the mole and also take new steps to get the mole moving again. Scientists believed that a lack of friction with the surrounding regolith was preventing the mole from gaining traction as it attempted to hammer deeper into the surface. Removal of the support structure confirmed that hypothesis. Images showed the top of the mole peeking out above the surface in a hole about twice the diameter of the mole. A twist in the tether linking the mole to the rest of the instrument suggested it had started to spin around, widening the hole, as it tried to hammer deeper into the surface. The instrument team then used InSight's robotic arm again, pressing the scoop at the end of arm against the surface around the hole to try and collapse it. In an Aug. 27 blog post, Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the instrument at the German space agency DLR, said that images taken after those attempts showed that the pit was only, at best, partially collapsed on one side. Spohn said it appears there is a layer of \"duricrust,\" or regolith that is mechanically strong, on the surface, covered by about a centimeter of loose dust. Below that duricrust, which he estimated to be five to ten centimeters thick, could be \"cohesionless sand\" that prevents the mole from penetrating. InSight is currently on hiatus while it and other spacecraft at Mars are in solar conjunction, with the sun between Mars and the Earth blocking communications. Spohn said that while the break is a time for some to take a vacation, he and others are thinking about new ways to get the mole moving again. One possibility would be to use the scoop on the robotic arm in a different way. \"I am thinking towards pinning the mole with the scoop such that the pinning and the pressing of the mole against the wall of the pit would increase friction,\" he wrote. \"This will be more risky than the previous strategy, but with the unexpectedly stiff duricrust, it may be worth a try.\" Spohn didn't state when the mission would try a new approach to get the mole moving again. Andrew Good, a spokesman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said Aug. 29 that there will be no action immediately after the solar conjunction period ends Sept. 7. It will take about a week after that to get all the data back from InSight and other spacecraft at Mars. \"Even after that, the team is continuing to conduct testing and discuss the next move,\" he said, and thus there is no firm date for deciding what to do next with the mole.

But, the reason behind this is currently not known. This is among the preliminary findings of NASA's InSight lander, the National Geographic reported. According to The Indian Express, ever since it landed on the red planet last year in November, the InSight lander has been collecting various information that will help space scientists understand our neighbouring planet better. According to the revelations during a meeting of European Planetary Science Congress and the American Astronomical Society, the magnetic fields of Mars are \"quite strange and odd.\" In addition to the strange magnetic pulse, the data from the lander also revealed that Mar's crust is way more magnetic than what space scientists had expected. The InSight mission has also picked up a peculiar electrically conductive layer, that is around 2.5 miles thick and deep beneath the surface of the red planet. There might be a chance that this particular layer might represent a reservoir of liquid water, however, it is too early to be certain about it, the report said. InSight seems to have found an electrically conductive layer almost 62 miles below the surface of Mars, looking quite similar to how water that is deep under the Earth's crust appears when we use terrestrial magnetometers, The Indian Express reported. In our own planet, the groundwater is locked under the soil and rocks. In case a similar groundwater resource is found on the neighbouring planet then it should not be surprising, the report said quoting Jani Radebaugh, a planetary scientist at Brigham Young University. If indeed there is water in such a large region then it implies that there is potential for life, past or present. At the moment, none of the data have gone through peer review and the details of the initial findings and interpretations will get tweaked over the period of time, the report said.

He reported the findings on 12 December at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California. Since arriving on Mars just over a year ago, InSight has detected 322 marsquakes. They are the first quakes ever detected on Mars, and the first on any body other than Earth or the Moon. Scientists aim to use them to probe the Martian interior, including deciphering the planet's guts into layers of crust, mantle, and core. Most of the marsquakes are tiny, much smaller than anything that would be felt on Earth. But a couple have been big enough - up to nearly magnitude 4 - for scientists to be able to trace them back to their source. Two of the biggest marsquakes came from a geologically active area known as Cerberus Fossae, which lies about 1,600 kilometres east of InSight. The quakes there might have been caused by the build-up of stress along geological faults in the Martian crust, and then released in a marsquake.

The probe, dubbed 'the mole', has encountered more friction in the soil than scientists had expected. In October, it even unexpectedly backed out of its hole. The biggest discoveries so far have come from the ever-expanding catalogue of marsquakes. InSight's highly sensitive seismometer hunts for quakes at night, after the winds that shake the ground during the day die down. The marsquakes come in two types. The most common shakes the ground at high frequencies. Less common is a type that is detectable at lower frequencies. The high-frequency signals might be coming from quakes that rupture the shallow Martian crust, whereas the low-frequency ones might be travelling from deeper within the planet, in its mantle, said Domenico Giardini, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Two of the biggest marsquakes hit in May and July. Both were the low-frequency type. Team members were able to trace the seismic energy back to Cerberus Fossae. This area is home to recent geological activity, including faults that seem to have moved in the past ten million years. Before InSight launched, researchers had predicted it might be able to detect quakes coming from Cerberus Fossae. The faults there could build up stress at their ends, said Alice Jacob, a planetary scientist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics. An analysis she led suggests that this could be the source of the marsquakes picked up by InSight. The rate of quakes has been increasing, Banerdt said - from a few sporadic tremors reported after InSight landed to the current pace of two a day. Mission scientists aren't sure why. Equally mysterious are the magnetic pulses that show up every night. InSight measured them with its magnetometer, and they are thought to be related to something happening in the space environment around Mars. One idea is that they are created when charged particles from the solar wind slam into Mars. InSight's greatest drama so far has come with its mole. It initially began burrowing into the ground as planned, but hit disaster in October, when it suddenly squirted out of its hole. Mission engineers designed the mole to work in a type of soil different from what it actually encountered. It was designed for cohesionless soil, in which particles flow with little to no friction between them - as in a vat of sugar. But InSight's landing place turned out to have cohesive soil, in which the particles stick together more like those in a vat of flour, says Tilman Spohn, a space scientist at the German Aerospace Center in Cologne, Germany. When the mole began burrowing, the soil around it became compacted into a pit. The mole could not build up enough friction against the pit's walls to keep moving into the ground. Spohn says that he and his colleagues had seen this happen in laboratory experiments involving cohesive soils, but that they expected InSight's landing place to have cohesionless soils because that's what other Martian landing sites have been like. InSight seems to have been unlucky enough to land in a place where the soil is compacted into a harder material called a duricrust, says Matthew Golombek, a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The duricrust is harder and possibly thicker than expected. Mission engineers have been trying to get past the problem by pinning the mole to the side of the pit with the lander's arm, to give it more friction to keep going. And it is starting to bury itself into the ground again, slowly and carefully. \"By Christmastime, maybe our present will be that we're back to square one,\" says Spohn. \"Which at this point in time would be a very, very welcome situation.\" ", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03796-7"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "InSight mission seeking new ways to fix heat flow probe", "date": "2019-08-30", "content": " Members of the InSight mission team are using a break in spacecraft operations to study new ways to get one of the spacecraft's key instruments to resume burrowing into the Martian surface. Scientists and engineers involved with InSight's Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument have been working for the last several months to get the instrument's probe, or \"mole,\" to start moving into the surface again. The mole, intended to hammer to a depth of five meters below the surface, stopped in early March only about 30 centimeters below the surface. In June, the mission decided to use the lander's robotic arm to remove the support structure for the instrument. That would allow the instrument team to get a better view of the condition of the mole and also take new steps to get the mole moving again. Scientists believed that a lack of friction with the surrounding regolith was preventing the mole from gaining traction as it attempted to hammer deeper into the surface. Removal of the support structure confirmed that hypothesis. Images showed the top of the mole peeking out above the surface in a hole about twice the diameter of the mole. A twist in the tether linking the mole to the rest of the instrument suggested it had started to spin around, widening the hole, as it tried to hammer deeper into the surface. The instrument team then used InSight's robotic arm again, pressing the scoop at the end of arm against the surface around the hole to try and collapse it. In an Aug. 27 blog post, Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the instrument at the German space agency DLR, said that images taken after those attempts showed that the pit was only, at best, partially collapsed on one side. Spohn said it appears there is a layer of \"duricrust,\" or regolith that is mechanically strong, on the surface, covered by about a centimeter of loose dust. Below that duricrust, which he estimated to be five to ten centimeters thick, could be \"cohesionless sand\" that prevents the mole from penetrating. InSight is currently on hiatus while it and other spacecraft at Mars are in solar conjunction, with the sun between Mars and the Earth blocking communications. Spohn said that while the break is a time for some to take a vacation, he and others are thinking about new ways to get the mole moving again. One possibility would be to use the scoop on the robotic arm in a different way. \"I am thinking towards pinning the mole with the scoop such that the pinning and the pressing of the mole against the wall of the pit would increase friction,\" he wrote. \"This will be more risky than the previous strategy, but with the unexpectedly stiff duricrust, it may be worth a try.\" Spohn didn't state when the mission would try a new approach to get the mole moving again. Andrew Good, a spokesman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said Aug. 29 that there will be no action immediately after the solar conjunction period ends Sept. 7. It will take about a week after that to get all the data back from InSight and other spacecraft at Mars. \"Even after that, the team is continuing to conduct testing and discuss the next move,\" he said, and thus there is no firm date for deciding what to do next with the mole.

But, the reason behind this is currently not known. This is among the preliminary findings of NASA's InSight lander, the National Geographic reported. According to The Indian Express, ever since it landed on the red planet last year in November, the InSight lander has been collecting various information that will help space scientists understand our neighbouring planet better. According to the revelations during a meeting of European Planetary Science Congress and the American Astronomical Society, the magnetic fields of Mars are \"quite strange and odd.\" In addition to the strange magnetic pulse, the data from the lander also revealed that Mar's crust is way more magnetic than what space scientists had expected. The InSight mission has also picked up a peculiar electrically conductive layer, that is around 2.5 miles thick and deep beneath the surface of the red planet. There might be a chance that this particular layer might represent a reservoir of liquid water, however, it is too early to be certain about it, the report said. InSight seems to have found an electrically conductive layer almost 62 miles below the surface of Mars, looking quite similar to how water that is deep under the Earth's crust appears when we use terrestrial magnetometers, The Indian Express reported. In our own planet, the groundwater is locked under the soil and rocks. In case a similar groundwater resource is found on the neighbouring planet then it should not be surprising, the report said quoting Jani Radebaugh, a planetary scientist at Brigham Young University. If indeed there is water in such a large region then it implies that there is potential for life, past or present. At the moment, none of the data have gone through peer review and the details of the initial findings and interpretations will get tweaked over the period of time, the report said. NASA has recently won an Emmy Award for its InSight mission, which is the first to study the deep interiors of Mars by using an ultra-sensitive seismometer, a heat-flow probe and other instruments.

The InSight team found that delicate parts inside the seismometer itself were expanding and contracting, causing \"dinks and donks\" - the team's nickname for strange mechanical sounds - to show up in the samples received and analyzed back on Earth. In sum, the eerie noises turned out to be a mixture of wind gusts, sounds from mechanical movements of parts inside the lander itself, and marsquakes. The lander's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure sensor has detected more than 100 events since the rover placed it on the Martian surface in January. In April, InSight recorded its first ever marsquake - \"faint rumbles\" that \"appear to have come from the inside of the planet,\" according to NASA. The InSight team believes that marsquakes last for tens of minutes, unlike the seconds here on Earth, thanks to the Red Planet's dried crust in which fractures remain after impact. The sound waves are able to scatter, rather than travel in a single line like here on Earth, allowing sound waves to continue uninterrupted. \"It's been exciting, especially in the beginning, hearing the first vibrations from the lander,\" said Imperial College London's Constantinos Charalambous, who's on InSight's SEIS team, in a statement. \"You're imagining what's really happening on Mars as InSight sits on the open landscape.\" ", "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/insight-s-super-sensitive-seismometer-has-detected-some-strange-sounds-on-mars"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight mission tunes in to the strange sounds of Mars", "date": "2019-10-03", "content": "Mars is full of subtle sounds and thanks to NASA's InSight mission, we're finally able to hear them. The stationary probe's seismometer, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, is sensitive enough to pick up the most gentle of vibrations. The seismometer has been listening out for earthquakes on Mars. Seismic activity can paint a picture of the interior of a planet and how it was formed, which is one of InSight's main objectives for Mars. InSight landed on Mars in November 2018 and placed the seismometer on the Martian surface in February. But the Red Planet didn't produce any sounds until April. And even then, something strange happened. It's a seismic signal that was recorded April 6, and by all indications, the InSight team believes this sound is a quake from within the planet rather than something on the surface. But the signal was at a high frequency and nothing like it has been produced since. InSight has detected more than 100 events since April and the researchers estimate 21 of them could be quakes. NASA shared some recordings of rumblings captured in May and July. Both occurred below the human range of hearing, but were processed so we could hear them. The May quake had a magnitude of 3.7 and the July quake reached 3.3 Mars doesn't have tectonic plates, which are the cause of quakes on Earth. Martian quakes are caused by cooling and contraction, which create stress fractures on the crust. NASA just heard the first sounds of wind on Mars. You can hear them, too. \"It's been exciting, especially in the beginning, hearing the first vibrations from the lander,\" said Constantinos Charalambous, an InSight science team member at Imperial College London. \"You're imagining what's really happening on Mars as InSight sits on the open landscape.\" When the InSight arm moves, friction can be heard in the seismometer, producing intriguing sounds. Wind picks up during the day, so it's easier for the researchers to listen out for quakes at night. But nightfall comes with its own unique sounds. The InSight researchers call them \" dinks and donks \" - the expansion and contraction of parts inside the seismometer, possibly due to heat loss. In one of the sound samples, a strange whistling can also be heard. The researchers think there is interference with the electronics in the seismometer. InSight, or Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is a two-year mission to explore a part of Mars that we know the least about: its deep interior. The suite of geophysical instruments on InSight sounds like a doctor's bag, giving Mars its first \"checkup\" since the planet formed.

Known as \"the mole,\" the probe has been unable to dig more than about 14 inches since it began burying itself into the ground on February 28, 2019. The maneuver is in preparation for a tactic, to be tried over several weeks, called \"pinning.\" \"We're going to try pressing the side of the scoop against the mole, pinning it to the wall of its hole,\" said InSight Deputy Principal Investigator Sue Smrekar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might increase friction enough to keep it moving forward when mole hammering resumes.\" Whether the extra pressure on the mole will compensate for the unique soil remains an unknown. Designed to burrow as much as 16 feet underground to record the amount of heat escaping from the planet's interior, the mole needs friction from surrounding soil in order to dig: Without it, recoil from the self- hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place, which is what the mission team suspects is happening now. While JPL manages the InSight mission for NASA, the German Aerospace Center provided the heat probe, which is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package. Back in June, the team devised a plan to help the heat probe. The mole wasn't designed to be picked up and relocated once it begins digging. Instead, the robotic arm removed a support structure intended to hold the mole steady as it digs into the Martian surface. NASA InSight's robotic arm will use its scoop to pin the spacecraft's heat probe, or \"mole,\" against the wall of its hole. The mole is part of an instrument formally called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, provided by the German Aerospace Center. Removing the structure allowed the InSight team to get a better look at the hole that formed around the mole as it hammered. It's possible that the mole has hit a rock, but testing by DLR suggested the issue was soil that clumps together rather than falling around the mole as it hammers. Sure enough, the arm's camera discovered that below the surface appears to be 2 to 4 inches of duricrust, a kind of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions and different from the soil the mole was designed for. \"All we know about the soil is what we can see in images InSight sends us,\" said Tilman Spohn, HP3's principal investigator at DLR. \"Since we can't bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.\" Using a scoop on the robotic arm, the team poked and pushed the soil seven times over the summer in an effort to collapse the hole. No such luck. It shouldn't take much force to collapse the hole, but the arm isn't pushing at full strength. The team placed HP3 as far from the lander as possible so that the spacecraft's shadow wouldn't influence the heat probe's temperature readings. As a result, the arm, which wasn't intended to be used this way, has to stretch out and press at an angle, exerting much less force than if the mole were closer. \"We're asking the arm to punch above its weight,\" said Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, the lead arm engineer at JPL. \"The arm can't push the soil the way a person can. This would be easier if it could, but that's just not the arm we have.\" Interplanetary rescue operations aren't new to NASA. The Mars Exploration Rover team helped save Spirit and Opportunity on more than one occasion. Coming up with workable solutions requires an extraordinary amount of patience and planning. JPL has a working replica of InSight to practice arm movements, and it has a working model of the heat probe as well. Besides pinning, the team is also testing a technique to use the scoop in the way it was originally intended to work: scraping soil into the hole rather than trying to compress it. Both techniques might be visible to the public in raw images that come down from InSight in the near future.

Spohn says that he and his colleagues had seen this happen in laboratory experiments involving cohesive soils, but that they expected InSight's landing place to have cohesionless soils because that's what other Martian landing sites have been like. InSight seems to have been unlucky enough to land in a place where the soil is compacted into a harder material called a duricrust, says Matthew Golombek, a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The duricrust is harder and possibly thicker than expected. Mission engineers have been trying to get past the problem by pinning the mole to the side of the pit with the lander's arm, to give it more friction to keep going. And it is starting to bury itself into the ground again, slowly and carefully. \"By Christmastime, maybe our present will be that we're back to square one,\" says Spohn. \"Which at this point in time would be a very, very welcome situation.\" ", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03796-7"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "InSight lander reports 'strange' things on Mars", "date": "2019-09-27", "content": "The magnetic field of Mars at times tends to pulsate in ways which have never been observed before in the middle of the night. But, the reason behind this is currently not known. This is among the preliminary findings of NASA's InSight lander, the National Geographic reported. According to The Indian Express, ever since it landed on the red planet last year in November, the InSight lander has been collecting various information that will help space scientists understand our neighbouring planet better. According to the revelations during a meeting of European Planetary Science Congress and the American Astronomical Society, the magnetic fields of Mars are \"quite strange and odd.\" In addition to the strange magnetic pulse, the data from the lander also revealed that Mar's crust is way more magnetic than what space scientists had expected. The InSight mission has also picked up a peculiar electrically conductive layer, that is around 2.5 miles thick and deep beneath the surface of the red planet. There might be a chance that this particular layer might represent a reservoir of liquid water, however, it is too early to be certain about it, the report said. InSight seems to have found an electrically conductive layer almost 62 miles below the surface of Mars, looking quite similar to how water that is deep under the Earth's crust appears when we use terrestrial magnetometers, The Indian Express reported. In our own planet, the groundwater is locked under the soil and rocks. In case a similar groundwater resource is found on the neighbouring planet then it should not be surprising, the report said quoting Jani Radebaugh, a planetary scientist at Brigham Young University. If indeed there is water in such a large region then it implies that there is potential for life, past or present. At the moment, none of the data have gone through peer review and the details of the initial findings and interpretations will get tweaked over the period of time, the report said. NASA has recently won an Emmy Award for its InSight mission, which is the first to study the deep interiors of Mars by using an ultra-sensitive seismometer, a heat-flow probe and other instruments.

The InSight team found that delicate parts inside the seismometer itself were expanding and contracting, causing \"dinks and donks\" - the team's nickname for strange mechanical sounds - to show up in the samples received and analyzed back on Earth. In sum, the eerie noises turned out to be a mixture of wind gusts, sounds from mechanical movements of parts inside the lander itself, and marsquakes. The lander's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure sensor has detected more than 100 events since the rover placed it on the Martian surface in January. In April, InSight recorded its first ever marsquake - \"faint rumbles\" that \"appear to have come from the inside of the planet,\" according to NASA. The InSight team believes that marsquakes last for tens of minutes, unlike the seconds here on Earth, thanks to the Red Planet's dried crust in which fractures remain after impact. The sound waves are able to scatter, rather than travel in a single line like here on Earth, allowing sound waves to continue uninterrupted. \"It's been exciting, especially in the beginning, hearing the first vibrations from the lander,\" said Imperial College London's Constantinos Charalambous, who's on InSight's SEIS team, in a statement. \"You're imagining what's really happening on Mars as InSight sits on the open landscape.\" ", "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/insight-s-super-sensitive-seismometer-has-detected-some-strange-sounds-on-mars"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight mission tunes in to the strange sounds of Mars", "date": "2019-10-03", "content": "Mars is full of subtle sounds and thanks to NASA's InSight mission, we're finally able to hear them. The stationary probe's seismometer, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, is sensitive enough to pick up the most gentle of vibrations. The seismometer has been listening out for earthquakes on Mars. Seismic activity can paint a picture of the interior of a planet and how it was formed, which is one of InSight's main objectives for Mars. InSight landed on Mars in November 2018 and placed the seismometer on the Martian surface in February. But the Red Planet didn't produce any sounds until April. And even then, something strange happened. It's a seismic signal that was recorded April 6, and by all indications, the InSight team believes this sound is a quake from within the planet rather than something on the surface. But the signal was at a high frequency and nothing like it has been produced since. InSight has detected more than 100 events since April and the researchers estimate 21 of them could be quakes. NASA shared some recordings of rumblings captured in May and July. Both occurred below the human range of hearing, but were processed so we could hear them. The May quake had a magnitude of 3.7 and the July quake reached 3.3 Mars doesn't have tectonic plates, which are the cause of quakes on Earth. Martian quakes are caused by cooling and contraction, which create stress fractures on the crust. NASA just heard the first sounds of wind on Mars. You can hear them, too. \"It's been exciting, especially in the beginning, hearing the first vibrations from the lander,\" said Constantinos Charalambous, an InSight science team member at Imperial College London. \"You're imagining what's really happening on Mars as InSight sits on the open landscape.\" When the InSight arm moves, friction can be heard in the seismometer, producing intriguing sounds. Wind picks up during the day, so it's easier for the researchers to listen out for quakes at night. But nightfall comes with its own unique sounds. The InSight researchers call them \" dinks and donks \" - the expansion and contraction of parts inside the seismometer, possibly due to heat loss. In one of the sound samples, a strange whistling can also be heard. The researchers think there is interference with the electronics in the seismometer. InSight, or Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is a two-year mission to explore a part of Mars that we know the least about: its deep interior. The suite of geophysical instruments on InSight sounds like a doctor's bag, giving Mars its first \"checkup\" since the planet formed.

Known as \"the mole,\" the probe has been unable to dig more than about 14 inches since it began burying itself into the ground on February 28, 2019. The maneuver is in preparation for a tactic, to be tried over several weeks, called \"pinning.\" \"We're going to try pressing the side of the scoop against the mole, pinning it to the wall of its hole,\" said InSight Deputy Principal Investigator Sue Smrekar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might increase friction enough to keep it moving forward when mole hammering resumes.\" Whether the extra pressure on the mole will compensate for the unique soil remains an unknown. Designed to burrow as much as 16 feet underground to record the amount of heat escaping from the planet's interior, the mole needs friction from surrounding soil in order to dig: Without it, recoil from the self- hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place, which is what the mission team suspects is happening now. While JPL manages the InSight mission for NASA, the German Aerospace Center provided the heat probe, which is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package. Back in June, the team devised a plan to help the heat probe. The mole wasn't designed to be picked up and relocated once it begins digging. Instead, the robotic arm removed a support structure intended to hold the mole steady as it digs into the Martian surface. NASA InSight's robotic arm will use its scoop to pin the spacecraft's heat probe, or \"mole,\" against the wall of its hole. The mole is part of an instrument formally called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, provided by the German Aerospace Center. Removing the structure allowed the InSight team to get a better look at the hole that formed around the mole as it hammered. It's possible that the mole has hit a rock, but testing by DLR suggested the issue was soil that clumps together rather than falling around the mole as it hammers. Sure enough, the arm's camera discovered that below the surface appears to be 2 to 4 inches of duricrust, a kind of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions and different from the soil the mole was designed for. \"All we know about the soil is what we can see in images InSight sends us,\" said Tilman Spohn, HP3's principal investigator at DLR. \"Since we can't bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.\" Using a scoop on the robotic arm, the team poked and pushed the soil seven times over the summer in an effort to collapse the hole. No such luck. It shouldn't take much force to collapse the hole, but the arm isn't pushing at full strength. The team placed HP3 as far from the lander as possible so that the spacecraft's shadow wouldn't influence the heat probe's temperature readings. As a result, the arm, which wasn't intended to be used this way, has to stretch out and press at an angle, exerting much less force than if the mole were closer. \"We're asking the arm to punch above its weight,\" said Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, the lead arm engineer at JPL. \"The arm can't push the soil the way a person can. This would be easier if it could, but that's just not the arm we have.\" Interplanetary rescue operations aren't new to NASA. The Mars Exploration Rover team helped save Spirit and Opportunity on more than one occasion. Coming up with workable solutions requires an extraordinary amount of patience and planning. JPL has a working replica of InSight to practice arm movements, and it has a working model of the heat probe as well. Besides pinning, the team is also testing a technique to use the scoop in the way it was originally intended to work: scraping soil into the hole rather than trying to compress it. Both techniques might be visible to the public in raw images that come down from InSight in the near future.

It was designed to reach at least 16 feet beneath the surface to record how heat escapes from the interior, according to NASA. The mole seems to be missing a key factor in digging: friction in the surrounding soil. Instead, the team believes that the probe is simply bouncing in place. Applying extra pressure may be a solution. \"We're going to try pressing the side of the scoop against the mole, pinning it to the wall of its hole,\" said Sue Smrekar, InSight deputy principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might increase friction enough to keep it moving forward when mole hammering resumes.\" Relocating the mole isn't the solution because it wasn't designed to be moved once it began digging. The mole, known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, was provided by the German Aerospace Center. In June, the experiment's team used the spacecraft's robotic arm to remove a structure keeping the mole steady so they could get a more direct view of what happened when the mole tried to dig. A camera on the arm revealed between two to four inches of duricrust beneath the surface. Duricrust is a hard crust at or near the surface of the ground typically formed by the accumulation of upward migration and evaporation of ground water. This soil that seems cemented together is thicker than what the mole was designed for. And it's nothing like the soil that previous Mars missions have run into before. \"All we know about the soil is what we can see in images InSight sends us,\" said Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the experiment. \"Since we can't bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.\" Over the last few months, the team used a scoop on the robotic arm to push and poke at the soil, hoping it would collapse the soil.

The burrowing heat probe aboard NASA's InSight Mars lander was originally supposed to dig 10 to 16 feet beneath the planet's red dirt, using a self-hammering tool called \"the mole.\" Shortly after deploying onto the Martian surface in February, however, the instrument became stuck about 1 foot down. Earlier this month, InSight team members announced that they'd managed to get the mole moving again by pinning it down with the lander's robotic arm. The breakthrough suggested that the digger had previously lost friction with the dirt, perhaps as a consequence of Mars soil's weird properties, rather than having run up against a big buried rock. This sequence of images shows the burrowing heat probe on NASA's InSight Mars lander popping back out of the hole it had dug on the Red Planet. But that downward progress was short-lived. The mole has backed about halfway out of its burrow, mission team members announced yesterday. \"Preliminary assessments point to unusual soil conditions on the Red Planet. The international mission team is developing the next steps to get it buried again,\" NASA officials wrote in an update yesterday. \"The next step is determining how safe it is to move InSight's robotic arm away from the mole to better assess the situation,\" they added. \"The team continues to look at the data and will formulate a plan in the next few days.\" The heat probe, officially called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, was provided by the German Aerospace Center. HP3 is one of InSight's two main science instruments. The other is a suite of supersensitive seismometers that were provided by the French space agency CNES and its partners, which are measuring and characterizing marsquakes. The data gathered by InSight, which touched down near the Martian equator in November 2018, will help scientists to construct a detailed 3D map of the Red Planet's interior. This information, in turn, should reveal a great deal about the formation and evolution of rocky planets in general, NASA officials have said. The seismometers have detected 150 events to date, 23 of which have already been confirmed as marsquakes, InSight project manager Tom Hoffman, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said earlier this month during a presentation at the 22nd Annual International Mars Society Convention in Los Angeles. \"The Insight mission overall is functioning very well,\" Zurbuchen said via Twitter yesterday. \"Remember that, even though the international team will continue to do their best to get this mole into the ground, the mole working is not a so-called Level 1 for mission success,\" he added in another tweet.

From its landing site near the Martian equator, NASA's InSight mission is detecting about two quakes per day - and the rate is going up. \"We have a lot,\" said Bruce Banerdt, a geophysicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and InSight's principal investigator. He reported the findings on 12 December at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California. Since arriving on Mars just over a year ago, InSight has detected 322 marsquakes. They are the first quakes ever detected on Mars, and the first on any body other than Earth or the Moon. Scientists aim to use them to probe the Martian interior, including deciphering the planet's guts into layers of crust, mantle, and core. Most of the marsquakes are tiny, much smaller than anything that would be felt on Earth. But a couple have been big enough - up to nearly magnitude 4 - for scientists to be able to trace them back to their source. Two of the biggest marsquakes came from a geologically active area known as Cerberus Fossae, which lies about 1,600 kilometres east of InSight. The quakes there might have been caused by the build-up of stress along geological faults in the Martian crust, and then released in a marsquake. Other early findings from the mission include mysterious magnetic pulses that appear around midnight each night around the lander. But one of InSight's main goals - to hammer a heat probe 5 metres into the Martian ground - remains frustratingly out of reach. The probe, dubbed 'the mole', has encountered more friction in the soil than scientists had expected. In October, it even unexpectedly backed out of its hole. The biggest discoveries so far have come from the ever-expanding catalogue of marsquakes. InSight's highly sensitive seismometer hunts for quakes at night, after the winds that shake the ground during the day die down. The marsquakes come in two types. The most common shakes the ground at high frequencies. Less common is a type that is detectable at lower frequencies. The high-frequency signals might be coming from quakes that rupture the shallow Martian crust, whereas the low-frequency ones might be travelling from deeper within the planet, in its mantle, said Domenico Giardini, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Two of the biggest marsquakes hit in May and July. Both were the low-frequency type. Team members were able to trace the seismic energy back to Cerberus Fossae. This area is home to recent geological activity, including faults that seem to have moved in the past ten million years. Before InSight launched, researchers had predicted it might be able to detect quakes coming from Cerberus Fossae. The faults there could build up stress at their ends, said Alice Jacob, a planetary scientist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics. An analysis she led suggests that this could be the source of the marsquakes picked up by InSight. The rate of quakes has been increasing, Banerdt said - from a few sporadic tremors reported after InSight landed to the current pace of two a day. Mission scientists aren't sure why. Equally mysterious are the magnetic pulses that show up every night. InSight measured them with its magnetometer, and they are thought to be related to something happening in the space environment around Mars. One idea is that they are created when charged particles from the solar wind slam into Mars. InSight's greatest drama so far has come with its mole. It initially began burrowing into the ground as planned, but hit disaster in October, when it suddenly squirted out of its hole. Mission engineers designed the mole to work in a type of soil different from what it actually encountered. It was designed for cohesionless soil, in which particles flow with little to no friction between them - as in a vat of sugar. But InSight's landing place turned out to have cohesive soil, in which the particles stick together more like those in a vat of flour, says Tilman Spohn, a space scientist at the German Aerospace Center in Cologne, Germany. When the mole began burrowing, the soil around it became compacted into a pit. The mole could not build up enough friction against the pit's walls to keep moving into the ground.

The mission team plans to command the scoop on InSight's robotic arm to press down on the \"mole,\" the mini pile driver designed to hammer itself as much as 16 feet down. They hope that pushing down on the mole's top, also called the back cap, will keep it from backing out of its hole on Mars, as it did twice in recent months after nearly burying itself. Part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, the mole is a 16-inch-long spike equipped with an internal hammering mechanism. While burrowing into the soil, it is designed to drag with it a ribbonlike tether that extends from the spacecraft. Temperature sensors are embedded along the tether to measure heat coming deep from within the planet's interior to reveal important scientific details about the formation of Mars and all rocky planets, including Earth. HP3 was provided to NASA by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR. The team has avoided pushing on the back cap until now to avoid any potential damage to the tether. The mole found itself stuck on Feb. 28, 2019, the first day of hammering. The InSight team has since determined that the soil here is different than what has been encountered on other parts of Mars. InSight landed in an area with an unusually thick duricrust, or a layer of cemented soil. Rather than being loose and sandlike, as expected, the dirt granules stick together. The mole needs friction from soil in order to travel downward; without it, recoil from its self-hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place. Ironically, loose soil, not duricrust, provides that friction as it falls around the mole. This past summer, the InSight team started using the robotic arm's scoop to press on the side of the mole, a technique called \"pinning\" that added just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile science tether connected to the mole's back cap. While pinning helped, the mole popped back out of the Martian soil on two occasions, possibly from soil building up from beneath. With few alternatives left, the team has decided to try helping the mole dig by carefully pressing on its back cap while attempting to avoid the tether. It might take several tries to perfect the back-cap push, just as pinning did. Throughout late February and early March, InSight's arm will be maneuvered into position so that the team can test what happens as the mole briefly hammers. Meanwhile, the team is also considering using the scoop to move more soil into the hole that has formed around the mole. This could add more pressure and friction, allowing it to finally dig down. Whether they pursue this route depends on how deep the mole is able to travel after the back-cap push.

Known familiarly as the \"mole,\" the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP^3, was provided by the German aerospace agency DLR. It is a 40-centimetre-long probe connected to the InSight lander by a cable studded with sensitive temperature sensors. It is designed to hammer its way below the surface, pulling the cable down behind it, to measure the planet's internal temperature. But on 28 February 2019, during an initial attempt to dig into the soil at the base of the lander, the mole stalled, tilting to one side as if it had run into a sub-surface rock or some other feature. Engineers later determined that instead of the expected loose, sand-like soil, the mole had run into a layer of denser, cemented soil. The mole was designed to take advantage of friction provided by looser soil to keep from simply bouncing in place as its internal hammer mechanism cycles. Last summer, engineers tried using InSight's robot arm to press down on the soil beside the mole, \"pinning\" it enough to provide the necessary friction. But on two occasions, the instrument popped back up, possibly because of soil building up underneath it. Now, the engineering team has decided to use the robot arm to press down on the probe's back cap to encourage the mole to hammer its way below the surface. Several trial runs are expected through March to perfect the technique, all the while being careful not to contact the probe's trailing cable. The team also is considering the use of a scoop on the arm to dump more soil into the hole that has formed around the mole, providing still more pressure and friction.

Tracking the probe's progression through the Martian atmosphere, personnel at mission control endured \" seven minutes of terror \"-a period of absolute helplessness, during which scientists could do nothing but wait with bated breath until their spacecraft confirmed it was safe. The touchdown was \" flawless ,\" NASA employees announced that day. And in the 16 months since, InSight has proved itself to be well worth the effort. The lander's first big batch of data, described in a suite of studies published this week in Nature Geoscience and Nature Communications, has pulled back the curtain on many once-mysterious aspects of Mars, including its intriguing seismic activity and surprisingly strong magnetic field. Shortly after settling near the Martian equator a year and a half ago, InSight got busy, deploying an array of instruments, including several ultra-sensitive seismometers and a burrowing heat probe. In April 2019, InSight's seismometer detected its first marsquake : a subtle rumble that hinted that, despite its decidedly non-Earth-like geology, Mars' interior has its own terrestrial temper. \"We've finally, for the first time, established that Mars is a seismically active planet,\" InSight principal investigator and NASA planetary scientist Bruce Banerdt said during a teleconference on February 20. Since that first find, the lander has detected more than 450 other tremors of varying severity, including several dozen belched up from the planet's mantle, roughly equivalent to magnitude 3 or 4 quakes here on Earth, reports Ian Sample for the _Guardian_. On average, Mars seems to shake more than the moon, but still pales in comparison to helter-skelter Earth. Were they to happen on Earth, most marsquakes would barely be detectable, seismologist Philippe Lognonn\u00e9 tells Ben Guarino at the Washington Post. Still mysterious, however, is the origin of these extraterrestrial trembles. While earthbound quakes arise when our planet's tectonic plates grind up against one another, Mars lacks the same internal architecture, leaving researchers puzzled about the source of its quakes. But two temblors that appear to have arisen from a Martian structure called Cerberus Fossae, a series of deep surface fissures that were recently geologically and volcanically active, have provided researchers with hints, InSight deputy principal investigator Suzanne Smrekar tells the Washington Post. Based on InSight's data, researchers think pockets of magma may still be moving, cooling and contracting deep in the Red Planet's innards, causing cracks, then quivers, at its brittle rocky surface, reports Maya Wei-Haas for National Geographic. Also described in the new finds is a mysterious and persistent hum that pervades the Martian landscape. Though the slosh of Earth's oceans produces a comparable sound, scientists have yet to suss out a plausible cause for the Red Planet's curious tune. \"It's extremely puzzling,\" Banerdt tells National Geographic. Another surprise has come from data collected by InSight's magnetometer, which has picked up on a local magnetic field about ten times stronger than researchers expected to see. Though Mars once had a magnetic north and south like Earth, its internal dynamo, or liquid metal interior, stopped churning billions of years ago, stripping the planet of its global magnetic field. But magnetic minerals still exist in Martian rocks, locked in like a time capsule of the planet's long-gone magnetism. \"They're like little tape recorders,\" InSight team member Catherine Johnson told the Washington Post. Combined with a series of pulsating electric currents found in Mars' atmosphere, these blips of local magnetism may be the source of InSight's unexpected detection. \"This measurement was our first little tiny taste-one single point-of how much stronger the magnetization might be,\" Robert Lillis, a planetary space physicist at the University of California, Berkeley who wasn't involved in the studies tells _National Geographic. InSight is still fervently collecting data, which NASA is releasing to the public at three-month intervals. Once cache of results, though, has so far been conspicuously absent: readings from the craft's subterranean heat probe, nicknamed the \"mole,\" which has been unable to penetrate the cementlike soil that cakes InSight's landing site. Over the next couple months, mission team members will try to leverage the robot's arm to help the mole break ground, reports Mike Wall for Space.com. For the most part, though, things on the Red Planet remain on track, team members report. As Banerdt tells Space.com, \"I think we're well on our way to getting most, if not all, of the goals that we set for ourselves ten years ago when we started this mission.\" ", "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/insight-landers-first-big-batch-data-reveals-mars-seismic-activity-and-surprising-magnetism-180974268/"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight mission shows Mars is a seismically active world", "date": "2020-02-26", "content": "While one of its two science instruments remains sidelined, NASA's InSight probe has proven Mars is seismically active through the detection of hundreds of quakes, some of which can be traced to a volcanic region nearly 1,000 miles away. Since landing on Mars in November 2018, the InSight spacecraft's French-built seismometer has detected more than 450 seismic signals to date, according to NASA. Scientists believe the \"vast majority\" of the signals are probably from quakes, but some could be generated by wind. But none of the quakes registered by InSight have been stronger than magnitude 4.0, too weak to penetrate Mars' mantle and core and reveal insights about the red planet's deep interior. Data from the first year of results from NASA's InSight mission were published in six papers Monday. Scientists released the papers in in the scientific journals Nature and Nature Geoscience. InSight is the first mission to detect a \"marsquake\" on the red planet. The spacecraft landed on a broad equatorial plain in a region known as Elysium Planitia. \"The detections thus far are consistent with tectonic origins, with no impact- induced seismicity yet observed, and indicate a seismically active planet,\" the InSight science team wrote in Nature. The first batch of seismic measurements suggest Mars is \"moderately active\" with far more quakes than detected on the moon, scientists wrote in Nature. Mars lacks the tectonic plates responsible for the strongest seismic tremors on Earth, but evidence of volcanic activity on Mars in the recent geologic past could provide clues to one origin of the quakes registered by InSight. \"Mars trembles more often - but also more mildly - than expected,\" NASA said. Scientists traced the origin of two of the quakes to a region named Cerberus Fossae roughly 1,000 miles to the east of the InSight landing site. Images acquired by cameras orbiting Mars show faults and channels in the Cerberus Fossae region, evidence of lava flows and running water. Some of the volcanic flows at Cerberus Fossae occurred in the last 10 million years, scientists concluded due to the lack of fresh impact craters in the region. Landslides at Cerberus Fossae appear to indicate boulders may have been shaken loose by marsquakes, presumably tremors triggered by volcanic activity. \"It's just about the youngest tectonic feature on the planet,\" said Matt Golombek, a planetary geologist at JPL. \"The fact that we're seeing evidence of shaking in this region isn't a surprise, but it's very cool.\" Scientists believe InSight may landed on Mars during a relatively quiet period of seismic activity because it took several months for the probe to detect its first confirmed seismic signal. By the end of 2019, the mission's seismic instrument - named SEIS - was detecting around two seismic events per day. Meanwhile, InSight's other science instrument - an underground heat probe - continues having trouble hammering into the Martian soil. The German-built Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, instrument was supposed to burrow up to 16 feet into the Martian crust, deeper than any sensor from previous Mars missions. The HP3 instrument's self-hammering mole got stuck on the first day it began digging into the Martian soil. The soil at InSight's landing site appears to clump together rather than loosely fall around the mole as it hammers. Inspections using InSight's robot arm camera indicated the presence of 2 to 4 inches of duricrust, a type of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions, NASA officials said. The duricrust is also different from the soil the mole was designed for. The unique soil properties have caused the mole to bounce in place as it recoils from each stroke of its built in hammer mechanism, rather than dig deeper as designed. Last summer, ground controllers began using the scoop on the InSight lander's robotic arm to push against the side of the 16-inch-long spike as it resumed hammering into the ground. The pinning method appeared to help, but the mole backed out of the ground two times. Now mission managers have elected to try a more risky method to push on the back cap of the mole with the robotic arm as the spike hammers into the ground. Ground teams will take it slow with the new pushing method to avoid damaging an umbilical that trails behind the mole. The tether contains multiple temperature sensors to gather thermal data at various depths underneath the Martian surface, and cables to route science data back to the InSight lander for transmission to Earth. The heat flow measurements intended to be collected by the HP3 instrument are part of the $1 billion InSight mission's so-called \"Level 1\" requirements, but were listed as a stretch goal, not as a requirement for minimum mission success, according to Bruce Banerdt, the mission's principal investigator at JPL. \"NASA funds our mission and supports us, and in return, we sort of promise a certain number of scientific measurements and results,\" Banerdt said last year. \"We have about 10 of those for InSight. We call them our Level 1 requirements, and one of those Level 1 requirements is for a measurement of the heat flow of Mars using our HP3. The mission must meet at least six of the 10 Level 1 requirements to meet minimum success criteria, according to NASA officials. The InSight mission's third major science investigation is the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, or RISE. This experiment uses radio signals traveling between InSight and Earth receiving stations to track the wobble of Mars as it rotates, yielding insights into the planet's interior structure, including whether Mars has a liquid or solid core. Scientists have not yet made any conclusions from the RISE investigation. \"A solid core would cause Mars to wobble less than a liquid one would,\" NASA said. \"This first year of data is just a start. Watching over a full Martian year will give scientists a much better idea of the size and speed of the planet's wobble.\" Other data collected by InSight last year suggest rocks beneath the probe's landing site are more magnetized than scientists predicted. The magnetic signals are relics left over from when Mars had a magnetic field billions of years ago. The Martian magnetic field withered away, but rocks buried 200 feet to several miles beneath the planet's surface were magnetized by the field. Rocks closer to the surface are too young to carry the remnant magnetism. InSight carried the first magnetometer to the surface of Mars to investigate how the magnetic field's ancient impacts can still be sensed today. The initial InSight results indicate the magnetism coming from the deep rock layers is 10 times stronger than expected. \"This magnetism must be coming from ancient rocks underground,\" said Catherine Johnson, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and the Planetary Science Institute. \"We're combining these data with what we know from seismology and geology to understand the magnetized layers below InSight. How strong or deep would they have to be for us to detect this field?\" Weather sensors on InSight have detected thousands of whirlwinds passing over the lander in its first year on Mars. The mission's flat landing site has more whirlwinds than other place on Mars with weather instruments, but InSight's cameras have not spotted any dust devils, which occur when the spinning winds pick up grit and become visible, according to NASA.

The InSight team found that delicate parts inside the seismometer itself were expanding and contracting, causing \"dinks and donks\" - the team's nickname for strange mechanical sounds - to show up in the samples received and analyzed back on Earth. In sum, the eerie noises turned out to be a mixture of wind gusts, sounds from mechanical movements of parts inside the lander itself, and marsquakes. The lander's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure sensor has detected more than 100 events since the rover placed it on the Martian surface in January. In April, InSight recorded its first ever marsquake - \"faint rumbles\" that \"appear to have come from the inside of the planet,\" according to NASA. The InSight team believes that marsquakes last for tens of minutes, unlike the seconds here on Earth, thanks to the Red Planet's dried crust in which fractures remain after impact. The sound waves are able to scatter, rather than travel in a single line like here on Earth, allowing sound waves to continue uninterrupted. \"It's been exciting, especially in the beginning, hearing the first vibrations from the lander,\" said Imperial College London's Constantinos Charalambous, who's on InSight's SEIS team, in a statement. \"You're imagining what's really happening on Mars as InSight sits on the open landscape.\" ", "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/insight-s-super-sensitive-seismometer-has-detected-some-strange-sounds-on-mars"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight mission tunes in to the strange sounds of Mars", "date": "2019-10-03", "content": "Mars is full of subtle sounds and thanks to NASA's InSight mission, we're finally able to hear them. The stationary probe's seismometer, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, is sensitive enough to pick up the most gentle of vibrations. The seismometer has been listening out for earthquakes on Mars. Seismic activity can paint a picture of the interior of a planet and how it was formed, which is one of InSight's main objectives for Mars. InSight landed on Mars in November 2018 and placed the seismometer on the Martian surface in February. But the Red Planet didn't produce any sounds until April. And even then, something strange happened. It's a seismic signal that was recorded April 6, and by all indications, the InSight team believes this sound is a quake from within the planet rather than something on the surface. But the signal was at a high frequency and nothing like it has been produced since. InSight has detected more than 100 events since April and the researchers estimate 21 of them could be quakes. NASA shared some recordings of rumblings captured in May and July. Both occurred below the human range of hearing, but were processed so we could hear them. The May quake had a magnitude of 3.7 and the July quake reached 3.3 Mars doesn't have tectonic plates, which are the cause of quakes on Earth. Martian quakes are caused by cooling and contraction, which create stress fractures on the crust. NASA just heard the first sounds of wind on Mars. You can hear them, too. \"It's been exciting, especially in the beginning, hearing the first vibrations from the lander,\" said Constantinos Charalambous, an InSight science team member at Imperial College London. \"You're imagining what's really happening on Mars as InSight sits on the open landscape.\" When the InSight arm moves, friction can be heard in the seismometer, producing intriguing sounds. Wind picks up during the day, so it's easier for the researchers to listen out for quakes at night. But nightfall comes with its own unique sounds. The InSight researchers call them \" dinks and donks \" - the expansion and contraction of parts inside the seismometer, possibly due to heat loss. In one of the sound samples, a strange whistling can also be heard. The researchers think there is interference with the electronics in the seismometer. InSight, or Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is a two-year mission to explore a part of Mars that we know the least about: its deep interior. The suite of geophysical instruments on InSight sounds like a doctor's bag, giving Mars its first \"checkup\" since the planet formed.

Known as \"the mole,\" the probe has been unable to dig more than about 14 inches since it began burying itself into the ground on February 28, 2019. The maneuver is in preparation for a tactic, to be tried over several weeks, called \"pinning.\" \"We're going to try pressing the side of the scoop against the mole, pinning it to the wall of its hole,\" said InSight Deputy Principal Investigator Sue Smrekar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might increase friction enough to keep it moving forward when mole hammering resumes.\" Whether the extra pressure on the mole will compensate for the unique soil remains an unknown. Designed to burrow as much as 16 feet underground to record the amount of heat escaping from the planet's interior, the mole needs friction from surrounding soil in order to dig: Without it, recoil from the self- hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place, which is what the mission team suspects is happening now. While JPL manages the InSight mission for NASA, the German Aerospace Center provided the heat probe, which is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package. Back in June, the team devised a plan to help the heat probe. The mole wasn't designed to be picked up and relocated once it begins digging. Instead, the robotic arm removed a support structure intended to hold the mole steady as it digs into the Martian surface. NASA InSight's robotic arm will use its scoop to pin the spacecraft's heat probe, or \"mole,\" against the wall of its hole. The mole is part of an instrument formally called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, provided by the German Aerospace Center. Removing the structure allowed the InSight team to get a better look at the hole that formed around the mole as it hammered. It's possible that the mole has hit a rock, but testing by DLR suggested the issue was soil that clumps together rather than falling around the mole as it hammers. Sure enough, the arm's camera discovered that below the surface appears to be 2 to 4 inches of duricrust, a kind of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions and different from the soil the mole was designed for. \"All we know about the soil is what we can see in images InSight sends us,\" said Tilman Spohn, HP3's principal investigator at DLR. \"Since we can't bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.\" Using a scoop on the robotic arm, the team poked and pushed the soil seven times over the summer in an effort to collapse the hole. No such luck. It shouldn't take much force to collapse the hole, but the arm isn't pushing at full strength. The team placed HP3 as far from the lander as possible so that the spacecraft's shadow wouldn't influence the heat probe's temperature readings. As a result, the arm, which wasn't intended to be used this way, has to stretch out and press at an angle, exerting much less force than if the mole were closer. \"We're asking the arm to punch above its weight,\" said Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, the lead arm engineer at JPL. \"The arm can't push the soil the way a person can. This would be easier if it could, but that's just not the arm we have.\" Interplanetary rescue operations aren't new to NASA. The Mars Exploration Rover team helped save Spirit and Opportunity on more than one occasion. Coming up with workable solutions requires an extraordinary amount of patience and planning. JPL has a working replica of InSight to practice arm movements, and it has a working model of the heat probe as well. Besides pinning, the team is also testing a technique to use the scoop in the way it was originally intended to work: scraping soil into the hole rather than trying to compress it. Both techniques might be visible to the public in raw images that come down from InSight in the near future.

The mole seems to be missing a key factor in digging: friction in the surrounding soil. Instead, the team believes that the probe is simply bouncing in place. Applying extra pressure may be a solution. \"We're going to try pressing the side of the scoop against the mole, pinning it to the wall of its hole,\" said Sue Smrekar, InSight deputy principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might increase friction enough to keep it moving forward when mole hammering resumes.\" Relocating the mole isn't the solution because it wasn't designed to be moved once it began digging. The mole, known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, was provided by the German Aerospace Center. In June, the experiment's team used the spacecraft's robotic arm to remove a structure keeping the mole steady so they could get a more direct view of what happened when the mole tried to dig. A camera on the arm revealed between two to four inches of duricrust beneath the surface. Duricrust is a hard crust at or near the surface of the ground typically formed by the accumulation of upward migration and evaporation of ground water. This soil that seems cemented together is thicker than what the mole was designed for. And it's nothing like the soil that previous Mars missions have run into before. \"All we know about the soil is what we can see in images InSight sends us,\" said Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the experiment. \"Since we can't bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.\" Over the last few months, the team used a scoop on the robotic arm to push and poke at the soil, hoping it would collapse the soil.

The burrowing heat probe aboard NASA's InSight Mars lander was originally supposed to dig 10 to 16 feet beneath the planet's red dirt, using a self-hammering tool called \"the mole.\" Shortly after deploying onto the Martian surface in February, however, the instrument became stuck about 1 foot down. Earlier this month, InSight team members announced that they'd managed to get the mole moving again by pinning it down with the lander's robotic arm. The breakthrough suggested that the digger had previously lost friction with the dirt, perhaps as a consequence of Mars soil's weird properties, rather than having run up against a big buried rock. This sequence of images shows the burrowing heat probe on NASA's InSight Mars lander popping back out of the hole it had dug on the Red Planet. But that downward progress was short-lived. The mole has backed about halfway out of its burrow, mission team members announced yesterday. \"Preliminary assessments point to unusual soil conditions on the Red Planet. The international mission team is developing the next steps to get it buried again,\" NASA officials wrote in an update yesterday. \"The next step is determining how safe it is to move InSight's robotic arm away from the mole to better assess the situation,\" they added. \"The team continues to look at the data and will formulate a plan in the next few days.\" The heat probe, officially called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, was provided by the German Aerospace Center.

The other is a suite of supersensitive seismometers that were provided by the French space agency CNES and its partners, which are measuring and characterizing marsquakes.

From its landing site near the Martian equator, NASA's InSight mission is detecting about two quakes per day - and the rate is going up. \"We have a lot,\" said Bruce Banerdt, a geophysicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and InSight's principal investigator. He reported the findings on 12 December at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California. Since arriving on Mars just over a year ago, InSight has detected 322 marsquakes. They are the first quakes ever detected on Mars, and the first on any body other than Earth or the Moon. Scientists aim to use them to probe the Martian interior, including deciphering the planet's guts into layers of crust, mantle, and core. Most of the marsquakes are tiny, much smaller than anything that would be felt on Earth. But a couple have been big enough - up to nearly magnitude 4 - for scientists to be able to trace them back to their source. Two of the biggest marsquakes came from a geologically active area known as Cerberus Fossae, which lies about 1,600 kilometres east of InSight. The quakes there might have been caused by the build-up of stress along geological faults in the Martian crust, and then released in a marsquake. Other early findings from the mission include mysterious magnetic pulses that appear around midnight each night around the lander. But one of InSight's main goals - to hammer a heat probe 5 metres into the Martian ground - remains frustratingly out of reach. The probe, dubbed 'the mole', has encountered more friction in the soil than scientists had expected. In October, it even unexpectedly backed out of its hole. The biggest discoveries so far have come from the ever-expanding catalogue of marsquakes. InSight's highly sensitive seismometer hunts for quakes at night, after the winds that shake the ground during the day die down. The marsquakes come in two types. The most common shakes the ground at high frequencies. Less common is a type that is detectable at lower frequencies. The high-frequency signals might be coming from quakes that rupture the shallow Martian crust, whereas the low-frequency ones might be travelling from deeper within the planet, in its mantle, said Domenico Giardini, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Two of the biggest marsquakes hit in May and July. Both were the low-frequency type. Team members were able to trace the seismic energy back to Cerberus Fossae. This area is home to recent geological activity, including faults that seem to have moved in the past ten million years. Before InSight launched, researchers had predicted it might be able to detect quakes coming from Cerberus Fossae. The faults there could build up stress at their ends, said Alice Jacob, a planetary scientist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics. An analysis she led suggests that this could be the source of the marsquakes picked up by InSight. The rate of quakes has been increasing, Banerdt said - from a few sporadic tremors reported after InSight landed to the current pace of two a day. Mission scientists aren't sure why. Equally mysterious are the magnetic pulses that show up every night. InSight measured them with its magnetometer, and they are thought to be related to something happening in the space environment around Mars. One idea is that they are created when charged particles from the solar wind slam into Mars. InSight's greatest drama so far has come with its mole. It initially began burrowing into the ground as planned, but hit disaster in October, when it suddenly squirted out of its hole. Mission engineers designed the mole to work in a type of soil different from what it actually encountered. It was designed for cohesionless soil, in which particles flow with little to no friction between them - as in a vat of sugar. But InSight's landing place turned out to have cohesive soil, in which the particles stick together more like those in a vat of flour, says Tilman Spohn, a space scientist at the German Aerospace Center in Cologne, Germany. When the mole began burrowing, the soil around it became compacted into a pit. The mole could not build up enough friction against the pit's walls to keep moving into the ground. Spohn says that he and his colleagues had seen this happen in laboratory experiments involving cohesive soils, but that they expected InSight's landing place to have cohesionless soils because that's what other Martian landing sites have been like. InSight seems to have been unlucky enough to land in a place where the soil is compacted into a harder material called a duricrust, says Matthew Golombek, a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The duricrust is harder and possibly thicker than expected. Mission engineers have been trying to get past the problem by pinning the mole to the side of the pit with the lander's arm, to give it more friction to keep going. And it is starting to bury itself into the ground again, slowly and carefully. \"By Christmastime, maybe our present will be that we're back to square one,\" says Spohn. \"Which at this point in time would be a very, very welcome situation.\" ", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03796-7"}, {"title": "Mars InSight Lander to Push on Top of the 'Mole'", "date": "2020-02-21", "content": "After nearly a year of trying to dig into the Martian surface, the heat probe belonging to NASA's InSight lander is about to get a push. The mission team plans to command the scoop on InSight's robotic arm to press down on the \"mole,\" the mini pile driver designed to hammer itself as much as 16 feet down. They hope that pushing down on the mole's top, also called the back cap, will keep it from backing out of its hole on Mars, as it did twice in recent months after nearly burying itself. Part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, the mole is a 16-inch-long spike equipped with an internal hammering mechanism. While burrowing into the soil, it is designed to drag with it a ribbonlike tether that extends from the spacecraft. Temperature sensors are embedded along the tether to measure heat coming deep from within the planet's interior to reveal important scientific details about the formation of Mars and all rocky planets, including Earth. HP3 was provided to NASA by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR. The team has avoided pushing on the back cap until now to avoid any potential damage to the tether. The mole found itself stuck on Feb. 28, 2019, the first day of hammering. The InSight team has since determined that the soil here is different than what has been encountered on other parts of Mars. InSight landed in an area with an unusually thick duricrust, or a layer of cemented soil. Rather than being loose and sandlike, as expected, the dirt granules stick together. The mole needs friction from soil in order to travel downward; without it, recoil from its self-hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place. Ironically, loose soil, not duricrust, provides that friction as it falls around the mole. This past summer, the InSight team started using the robotic arm's scoop to press on the side of the mole, a technique called \"pinning\" that added just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile science tether connected to the mole's back cap. While pinning helped, the mole popped back out of the Martian soil on two occasions, possibly from soil building up from beneath. With few alternatives left, the team has decided to try helping the mole dig by carefully pressing on its back cap while attempting to avoid the tether. It might take several tries to perfect the back-cap push, just as pinning did. Throughout late February and early March, InSight's arm will be maneuvered into position so that the team can test what happens as the mole briefly hammers. Meanwhile, the team is also considering using the scoop to move more soil into the hole that has formed around the mole. This could add more pressure and friction, allowing it to finally dig down. Whether they pursue this route depends on how deep the mole is able to travel after the back-cap push.

Known familiarly as the \"mole,\" the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP^3, was provided by the German aerospace agency DLR. It is a 40-centimetre-long probe connected to the InSight lander by a cable studded with sensitive temperature sensors. It is designed to hammer its way below the surface, pulling the cable down behind it, to measure the planet's internal temperature. But on 28 February 2019, during an initial attempt to dig into the soil at the base of the lander, the mole stalled, tilting to one side as if it had run into a sub-surface rock or some other feature. Engineers later determined that instead of the expected loose, sand-like soil, the mole had run into a layer of denser, cemented soil. The mole was designed to take advantage of friction provided by looser soil to keep from simply bouncing in place as its internal hammer mechanism cycles. Last summer, engineers tried using InSight's robot arm to press down on the soil beside the mole, \"pinning\" it enough to provide the necessary friction. But on two occasions, the instrument popped back up, possibly because of soil building up underneath it. Now, the engineering team has decided to use the robot arm to press down on the probe's back cap to encourage the mole to hammer its way below the surface. Several trial runs are expected through March to perfect the technique, all the while being careful not to contact the probe's trailing cable.

Since landing on Mars in November 2018, the InSight spacecraft's French-built seismometer has detected more than 450 seismic signals to date, according to NASA. Scientists believe the \"vast majority\" of the signals are probably from quakes, but some could be generated by wind. But none of the quakes registered by InSight have been stronger than magnitude 4.0, too weak to penetrate Mars' mantle and core and reveal insights about the red planet's deep interior. Data from the first year of results from NASA's InSight mission were published in six papers Monday. Scientists released the papers in in the scientific journals Nature and Nature Geoscience. InSight is the first mission to detect a \"marsquake\" on the red planet. The spacecraft landed on a broad equatorial plain in a region known as Elysium Planitia. \"The detections thus far are consistent with tectonic origins, with no impact- induced seismicity yet observed, and indicate a seismically active planet,\" the InSight science team wrote in Nature. The first batch of seismic measurements suggest Mars is \"moderately active\" with far more quakes than detected on the moon, scientists wrote in Nature. Mars lacks the tectonic plates responsible for the strongest seismic tremors on Earth, but evidence of volcanic activity on Mars in the recent geologic past could provide clues to one origin of the quakes registered by InSight. \"Mars trembles more often - but also more mildly - than expected,\" NASA said. Scientists traced the origin of two of the quakes to a region named Cerberus Fossae roughly 1,000 miles to the east of the InSight landing site. Images acquired by cameras orbiting Mars show faults and channels in the Cerberus Fossae region, evidence of lava flows and running water. Some of the volcanic flows at Cerberus Fossae occurred in the last 10 million years, scientists concluded due to the lack of fresh impact craters in the region. Landslides at Cerberus Fossae appear to indicate boulders may have been shaken loose by marsquakes, presumably tremors triggered by volcanic activity. \"It's just about the youngest tectonic feature on the planet,\" said Matt Golombek, a planetary geologist at JPL. \"The fact that we're seeing evidence of shaking in this region isn't a surprise, but it's very cool.\" Scientists believe InSight may landed on Mars during a relatively quiet period of seismic activity because it took several months for the probe to detect its first confirmed seismic signal. By the end of 2019, the mission's seismic instrument - named SEIS - was detecting around two seismic events per day. Meanwhile, InSight's other science instrument - an underground heat probe - continues having trouble hammering into the Martian soil. The German-built Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, instrument was supposed to burrow up to 16 feet into the Martian crust, deeper than any sensor from previous Mars missions. The HP3 instrument's self-hammering mole got stuck on the first day it began digging into the Martian soil. The soil at InSight's landing site appears to clump together rather than loosely fall around the mole as it hammers. Inspections using InSight's robot arm camera indicated the presence of 2 to 4 inches of duricrust, a type of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions, NASA officials said. The duricrust is also different from the soil the mole was designed for. The unique soil properties have caused the mole to bounce in place as it recoils from each stroke of its built in hammer mechanism, rather than dig deeper as designed. Last summer, ground controllers began using the scoop on the InSight lander's robotic arm to push against the side of the 16-inch-long spike as it resumed hammering into the ground. The pinning method appeared to help, but the mole backed out of the ground two times. Now mission managers have elected to try a more risky method to push on the back cap of the mole with the robotic arm as the spike hammers into the ground. Ground teams will take it slow with the new pushing method to avoid damaging an umbilical that trails behind the mole. The tether contains multiple temperature sensors to gather thermal data at various depths underneath the Martian surface, and cables to route science data back to the InSight lander for transmission to Earth. The heat flow measurements intended to be collected by the HP3 instrument are part of the $1 billion InSight mission's so-called \"Level 1\" requirements, but were listed as a stretch goal, not as a requirement for minimum mission success, according to Bruce Banerdt, the mission's principal investigator at JPL. \"NASA funds our mission and supports us, and in return, we sort of promise a certain number of scientific measurements and results,\" Banerdt said last year. \"We have about 10 of those for InSight. We call them our Level 1 requirements, and one of those Level 1 requirements is for a measurement of the heat flow of Mars using our HP3. The mission must meet at least six of the 10 Level 1 requirements to meet minimum success criteria, according to NASA officials. The InSight mission's third major science investigation is the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, or RISE. This experiment uses radio signals traveling between InSight and Earth receiving stations to track the wobble of Mars as it rotates, yielding insights into the planet's interior structure, including whether Mars has a liquid or solid core. Scientists have not yet made any conclusions from the RISE investigation. \"A solid core would cause Mars to wobble less than a liquid one would,\" NASA said. \"This first year of data is just a start. Watching over a full Martian year will give scientists a much better idea of the size and speed of the planet's wobble.\" Other data collected by InSight last year suggest rocks beneath the probe's landing site are more magnetized than scientists predicted. The magnetic signals are relics left over from when Mars had a magnetic field billions of years ago. The Martian magnetic field withered away, but rocks buried 200 feet to several miles beneath the planet's surface were magnetized by the field. Rocks closer to the surface are too young to carry the remnant magnetism. InSight carried the first magnetometer to the surface of Mars to investigate how the magnetic field's ancient impacts can still be sensed today. The initial InSight results indicate the magnetism coming from the deep rock layers is 10 times stronger than expected. \"This magnetism must be coming from ancient rocks underground,\" said Catherine Johnson, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and the Planetary Science Institute. \"We're combining these data with what we know from seismology and geology to understand the magnetized layers below InSight. How strong or deep would they have to be for us to detect this field?\" Weather sensors on InSight have detected thousands of whirlwinds passing over the lander in its first year on Mars. The mission's flat landing site has more whirlwinds than other place on Mars with weather instruments, but InSight's cameras have not spotted any dust devils, which occur when the spinning winds pick up grit and become visible, according to NASA.

The InSight lander, which is currently on Mars, faced unexpected problems when its 38cm digging probe - also called a mole - became stuck in the soil. After a few failed attempts, the mole was freed - thanks to NASA encouraging it to \"hit itself\" with the jackhammer-like shovel. The risk of the operation was that it could have damaged the tether strap that provides power and communications from the lander to the mole. It is attached to the back part of the mole. The InSight's mission is to study temperature changes under the surface of Mars, in an attempt to understand how similar Mars' core is to Earth's. The mole is designed to dig down as far as 5m. Sensors in the mole detect the temperatures down in the burrow and send this information back to the InSight lander via the tether strap. The mole got stuck on February 28, 2019, the first day of digging. The mole needs friction from loose soil around it to travel downward. Without friction, it springs back from its self-hammering and just bounces up and down in the one place. First, the InSight team tried pinning, which is using the robotic arm's scoop to press on the side of the mole, adding just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile tether strap. Pinning helped but the mole popped back out of the Martian soil on two occasions, possibly from soil building up from beneath. A further option would be to use the shovel to move more soil into the hole where the mole is digging to help it work as it was designed to. 1. What is the Mars landing craft called? 2.

From its landing site near the Martian equator, NASA's InSight mission is detecting about two quakes per day - and the rate is going up. \"We have a lot,\" said Bruce Banerdt, a geophysicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and InSight's principal investigator. He reported the findings on 12 December at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California. Since arriving on Mars just over a year ago, InSight has detected 322 marsquakes. They are the first quakes ever detected on Mars, and the first on any body other than Earth or the Moon. Scientists aim to use them to probe the Martian interior, including deciphering the planet's guts into layers of crust, mantle, and core. Most of the marsquakes are tiny, much smaller than anything that would be felt on Earth. But a couple have been big enough - up to nearly magnitude 4 - for scientists to be able to trace them back to their source. Two of the biggest marsquakes came from a geologically active area known as Cerberus Fossae, which lies about 1,600 kilometres east of InSight. The quakes there might have been caused by the build-up of stress along geological faults in the Martian crust, and then released in a marsquake. Other early findings from the mission include mysterious magnetic pulses that appear around midnight each night around the lander. But one of InSight's main goals - to hammer a heat probe 5 metres into the Martian ground - remains frustratingly out of reach. The probe, dubbed 'the mole', has encountered more friction in the soil than scientists had expected. In October, it even unexpectedly backed out of its hole. The biggest discoveries so far have come from the ever-expanding catalogue of marsquakes. InSight's highly sensitive seismometer hunts for quakes at night, after the winds that shake the ground during the day die down. The marsquakes come in two types. The most common shakes the ground at high frequencies. Less common is a type that is detectable at lower frequencies. The high-frequency signals might be coming from quakes that rupture the shallow Martian crust, whereas the low-frequency ones might be travelling from deeper within the planet, in its mantle, said Domenico Giardini, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Two of the biggest marsquakes hit in May and July. Both were the low-frequency type. Team members were able to trace the seismic energy back to Cerberus Fossae. This area is home to recent geological activity, including faults that seem to have moved in the past ten million years. Before InSight launched, researchers had predicted it might be able to detect quakes coming from Cerberus Fossae. The faults there could build up stress at their ends, said Alice Jacob, a planetary scientist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics. An analysis she led suggests that this could be the source of the marsquakes picked up by InSight. The rate of quakes has been increasing, Banerdt said - from a few sporadic tremors reported after InSight landed to the current pace of two a day. Mission scientists aren't sure why. Equally mysterious are the magnetic pulses that show up every night. InSight measured them with its magnetometer, and they are thought to be related to something happening in the space environment around Mars. One idea is that they are created when charged particles from the solar wind slam into Mars. InSight's greatest drama so far has come with its mole. It initially began burrowing into the ground as planned, but hit disaster in October, when it suddenly squirted out of its hole. Mission engineers designed the mole to work in a type of soil different from what it actually encountered. It was designed for cohesionless soil, in which particles flow with little to no friction between them - as in a vat of sugar. But InSight's landing place turned out to have cohesive soil, in which the particles stick together more like those in a vat of flour, says Tilman Spohn, a space scientist at the German Aerospace Center in Cologne, Germany. When the mole began burrowing, the soil around it became compacted into a pit. The mole could not build up enough friction against the pit's walls to keep moving into the ground. Spohn says that he and his colleagues had seen this happen in laboratory experiments involving cohesive soils, but that they expected InSight's landing place to have cohesionless soils because that's what other Martian landing sites have been like. InSight seems to have been unlucky enough to land in a place where the soil is compacted into a harder material called a duricrust, says Matthew Golombek, a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The duricrust is harder and possibly thicker than expected. Mission engineers have been trying to get past the problem by pinning the mole to the side of the pit with the lander's arm, to give it more friction to keep going. And it is starting to bury itself into the ground again, slowly and carefully. \"By Christmastime, maybe our present will be that we're back to square one,\" says Spohn. \"Which at this point in time would be a very, very welcome situation.\" ", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03796-7"}, {"title": "Mars InSight Lander to Push on Top of the 'Mole'", "date": "2020-02-21", "content": "After nearly a year of trying to dig into the Martian surface, the heat probe belonging to NASA's InSight lander is about to get a push. The mission team plans to command the scoop on InSight's robotic arm to press down on the \"mole,\" the mini pile driver designed to hammer itself as much as 16 feet down. They hope that pushing down on the mole's top, also called the back cap, will keep it from backing out of its hole on Mars, as it did twice in recent months after nearly burying itself. Part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, the mole is a 16-inch-long spike equipped with an internal hammering mechanism. While burrowing into the soil, it is designed to drag with it a ribbonlike tether that extends from the spacecraft. Temperature sensors are embedded along the tether to measure heat coming deep from within the planet's interior to reveal important scientific details about the formation of Mars and all rocky planets, including Earth. HP3 was provided to NASA by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR. The team has avoided pushing on the back cap until now to avoid any potential damage to the tether. The mole found itself stuck on Feb. 28, 2019, the first day of hammering. The InSight team has since determined that the soil here is different than what has been encountered on other parts of Mars. InSight landed in an area with an unusually thick duricrust, or a layer of cemented soil. Rather than being loose and sandlike, as expected, the dirt granules stick together. The mole needs friction from soil in order to travel downward; without it, recoil from its self-hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place. Ironically, loose soil, not duricrust, provides that friction as it falls around the mole. This past summer, the InSight team started using the robotic arm's scoop to press on the side of the mole, a technique called \"pinning\" that added just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile science tether connected to the mole's back cap. While pinning helped, the mole popped back out of the Martian soil on two occasions, possibly from soil building up from beneath. With few alternatives left, the team has decided to try helping the mole dig by carefully pressing on its back cap while attempting to avoid the tether. It might take several tries to perfect the back-cap push, just as pinning did. Throughout late February and early March, InSight's arm will be maneuvered into position so that the team can test what happens as the mole briefly hammers. Meanwhile, the team is also considering using the scoop to move more soil into the hole that has formed around the mole. This could add more pressure and friction, allowing it to finally dig down. Whether they pursue this route depends on how deep the mole is able to travel after the back-cap push.

Known familiarly as the \"mole,\" the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP^3, was provided by the German aerospace agency DLR. It is a 40-centimetre-long probe connected to the InSight lander by a cable studded with sensitive temperature sensors. It is designed to hammer its way below the surface, pulling the cable down behind it, to measure the planet's internal temperature. But on 28 February 2019, during an initial attempt to dig into the soil at the base of the lander, the mole stalled, tilting to one side as if it had run into a sub-surface rock or some other feature. Engineers later determined that instead of the expected loose, sand-like soil, the mole had run into a layer of denser, cemented soil. The mole was designed to take advantage of friction provided by looser soil to keep from simply bouncing in place as its internal hammer mechanism cycles. Last summer, engineers tried using InSight's robot arm to press down on the soil beside the mole, \"pinning\" it enough to provide the necessary friction. But on two occasions, the instrument popped back up, possibly because of soil building up underneath it. Now, the engineering team has decided to use the robot arm to press down on the probe's back cap to encourage the mole to hammer its way below the surface. Several trial runs are expected through March to perfect the technique, all the while being careful not to contact the probe's trailing cable.

The heat flow measurements intended to be collected by the HP3 instrument are part of the $1 billion InSight mission's so-called \"Level 1\" requirements, but were listed as a stretch goal, not as a requirement for minimum mission success, according to Bruce Banerdt, the mission's principal investigator at JPL. \"NASA funds our mission and supports us, and in return, we sort of promise a certain number of scientific measurements and results,\" Banerdt said last year. \"We have about 10 of those for InSight. We call them our Level 1 requirements, and one of those Level 1 requirements is for a measurement of the heat flow of Mars using our HP3. The mission must meet at least six of the 10 Level 1 requirements to meet minimum success criteria, according to NASA officials. The InSight mission's third major science investigation is the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, or RISE. This experiment uses radio signals traveling between InSight and Earth receiving stations to track the wobble of Mars as it rotates, yielding insights into the planet's interior structure, including whether Mars has a liquid or solid core. Scientists have not yet made any conclusions from the RISE investigation. \"A solid core would cause Mars to wobble less than a liquid one would,\" NASA said. \"This first year of data is just a start. Watching over a full Martian year will give scientists a much better idea of the size and speed of the planet's wobble.\" Other data collected by InSight last year suggest rocks beneath the probe's landing site are more magnetized than scientists predicted. The magnetic signals are relics left over from when Mars had a magnetic field billions of years ago. The Martian magnetic field withered away, but rocks buried 200 feet to several miles beneath the planet's surface were magnetized by the field. Rocks closer to the surface are too young to carry the remnant magnetism. InSight carried the first magnetometer to the surface of Mars to investigate how the magnetic field's ancient impacts can still be sensed today. The initial InSight results indicate the magnetism coming from the deep rock layers is 10 times stronger than expected. \"This magnetism must be coming from ancient rocks underground,\" said Catherine Johnson, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and the Planetary Science Institute. \"We're combining these data with what we know from seismology and geology to understand the magnetized layers below InSight.

From its landing site near the Martian equator, NASA's InSight mission is detecting about two quakes per day - and the rate is going up. \"We have a lot,\" said Bruce Banerdt, a geophysicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and InSight's principal investigator. He reported the findings on 12 December at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California. Since arriving on Mars just over a year ago, InSight has detected 322 marsquakes. They are the first quakes ever detected on Mars, and the first on any body other than Earth or the Moon. Scientists aim to use them to probe the Martian interior, including deciphering the planet's guts into layers of crust, mantle, and core. Most of the marsquakes are tiny, much smaller than anything that would be felt on Earth. But a couple have been big enough - up to nearly magnitude 4 - for scientists to be able to trace them back to their source. Two of the biggest marsquakes came from a geologically active area known as Cerberus Fossae, which lies about 1,600 kilometres east of InSight. The quakes there might have been caused by the build-up of stress along geological faults in the Martian crust, and then released in a marsquake. Other early findings from the mission include mysterious magnetic pulses that appear around midnight each night around the lander. But one of InSight's main goals - to hammer a heat probe 5 metres into the Martian ground - remains frustratingly out of reach. The probe, dubbed 'the mole', has encountered more friction in the soil than scientists had expected. In October, it even unexpectedly backed out of its hole. The biggest discoveries so far have come from the ever-expanding catalogue of marsquakes. InSight's highly sensitive seismometer hunts for quakes at night, after the winds that shake the ground during the day die down. The marsquakes come in two types. The most common shakes the ground at high frequencies. Less common is a type that is detectable at lower frequencies. The high-frequency signals might be coming from quakes that rupture the shallow Martian crust, whereas the low-frequency ones might be travelling from deeper within the planet, in its mantle, said Domenico Giardini, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Two of the biggest marsquakes hit in May and July. Both were the low-frequency type. Team members were able to trace the seismic energy back to Cerberus Fossae. This area is home to recent geological activity, including faults that seem to have moved in the past ten million years. Before InSight launched, researchers had predicted it might be able to detect quakes coming from Cerberus Fossae. The faults there could build up stress at their ends, said Alice Jacob, a planetary scientist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics. An analysis she led suggests that this could be the source of the marsquakes picked up by InSight. The rate of quakes has been increasing, Banerdt said - from a few sporadic tremors reported after InSight landed to the current pace of two a day. Mission scientists aren't sure why. Equally mysterious are the magnetic pulses that show up every night. InSight measured them with its magnetometer, and they are thought to be related to something happening in the space environment around Mars. One idea is that they are created when charged particles from the solar wind slam into Mars. InSight's greatest drama so far has come with its mole. It initially began burrowing into the ground as planned, but hit disaster in October, when it suddenly squirted out of its hole. Mission engineers designed the mole to work in a type of soil different from what it actually encountered. It was designed for cohesionless soil, in which particles flow with little to no friction between them - as in a vat of sugar. But InSight's landing place turned out to have cohesive soil, in which the particles stick together more like those in a vat of flour, says Tilman Spohn, a space scientist at the German Aerospace Center in Cologne, Germany. When the mole began burrowing, the soil around it became compacted into a pit. The mole could not build up enough friction against the pit's walls to keep moving into the ground. Spohn says that he and his colleagues had seen this happen in laboratory experiments involving cohesive soils, but that they expected InSight's landing place to have cohesionless soils because that's what other Martian landing sites have been like. InSight seems to have been unlucky enough to land in a place where the soil is compacted into a harder material called a duricrust, says Matthew Golombek, a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The duricrust is harder and possibly thicker than expected. Mission engineers have been trying to get past the problem by pinning the mole to the side of the pit with the lander's arm, to give it more friction to keep going. And it is starting to bury itself into the ground again, slowly and carefully. \"By Christmastime, maybe our present will be that we're back to square one,\" says Spohn. \"Which at this point in time would be a very, very welcome situation.\" ", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03796-7"}, {"title": "Mars InSight Lander to Push on Top of the 'Mole'", "date": "2020-02-21", "content": "After nearly a year of trying to dig into the Martian surface, the heat probe belonging to NASA's InSight lander is about to get a push. The mission team plans to command the scoop on InSight's robotic arm to press down on the \"mole,\" the mini pile driver designed to hammer itself as much as 16 feet down. They hope that pushing down on the mole's top, also called the back cap, will keep it from backing out of its hole on Mars, as it did twice in recent months after nearly burying itself. Part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, the mole is a 16-inch-long spike equipped with an internal hammering mechanism. While burrowing into the soil, it is designed to drag with it a ribbonlike tether that extends from the spacecraft. Temperature sensors are embedded along the tether to measure heat coming deep from within the planet's interior to reveal important scientific details about the formation of Mars and all rocky planets, including Earth. HP3 was provided to NASA by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR. The team has avoided pushing on the back cap until now to avoid any potential damage to the tether. The mole found itself stuck on Feb. 28, 2019, the first day of hammering. The InSight team has since determined that the soil here is different than what has been encountered on other parts of Mars. InSight landed in an area with an unusually thick duricrust, or a layer of cemented soil. Rather than being loose and sandlike, as expected, the dirt granules stick together. The mole needs friction from soil in order to travel downward; without it, recoil from its self-hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place. Ironically, loose soil, not duricrust, provides that friction as it falls around the mole. This past summer, the InSight team started using the robotic arm's scoop to press on the side of the mole, a technique called \"pinning\" that added just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile science tether connected to the mole's back cap. While pinning helped, the mole popped back out of the Martian soil on two occasions, possibly from soil building up from beneath. With few alternatives left, the team has decided to try helping the mole dig by carefully pressing on its back cap while attempting to avoid the tether. It might take several tries to perfect the back-cap push, just as pinning did. Throughout late February and early March, InSight's arm will be maneuvered into position so that the team can test what happens as the mole briefly hammers. Meanwhile, the team is also considering using the scoop to move more soil into the hole that has formed around the mole. This could add more pressure and friction, allowing it to finally dig down. Whether they pursue this route depends on how deep the mole is able to travel after the back-cap push.

Known familiarly as the \"mole,\" the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP^3, was provided by the German aerospace agency DLR. It is a 40-centimetre-long probe connected to the InSight lander by a cable studded with sensitive temperature sensors. It is designed to hammer its way below the surface, pulling the cable down behind it, to measure the planet's internal temperature. But on 28 February 2019, during an initial attempt to dig into the soil at the base of the lander, the mole stalled, tilting to one side as if it had run into a sub-surface rock or some other feature. Engineers later determined that instead of the expected loose, sand-like soil, the mole had run into a layer of denser, cemented soil. The mole was designed to take advantage of friction provided by looser soil to keep from simply bouncing in place as its internal hammer mechanism cycles. Last summer, engineers tried using InSight's robot arm to press down on the soil beside the mole, \"pinning\" it enough to provide the necessary friction. But on two occasions, the instrument popped back up, possibly because of soil building up underneath it. Now, the engineering team has decided to use the robot arm to press down on the probe's back cap to encourage the mole to hammer its way below the surface. Several trial runs are expected through March to perfect the technique, all the while being careful not to contact the probe's trailing cable. The team also is considering the use of a scoop on the arm to dump more soil into the hole that has formed around the mole, providing still more pressure and friction.

Tracking the probe's progression through the Martian atmosphere, personnel at mission control endured \" seven minutes of terror \"-a period of absolute helplessness, during which scientists could do nothing but wait with bated breath until their spacecraft confirmed it was safe. The touchdown was \" flawless ,\" NASA employees announced that day. And in the 16 months since, InSight has proved itself to be well worth the effort. The lander's first big batch of data, described in a suite of studies published this week in Nature Geoscience and Nature Communications, has pulled back the curtain on many once-mysterious aspects of Mars, including its intriguing seismic activity and surprisingly strong magnetic field. Shortly after settling near the Martian equator a year and a half ago, InSight got busy, deploying an array of instruments, including several ultra-sensitive seismometers and a burrowing heat probe. In April 2019, InSight's seismometer detected its first marsquake : a subtle rumble that hinted that, despite its decidedly non-Earth-like geology, Mars' interior has its own terrestrial temper. \"We've finally, for the first time, established that Mars is a seismically active planet,\" InSight principal investigator and NASA planetary scientist Bruce Banerdt said during a teleconference on February 20. Since that first find, the lander has detected more than 450 other tremors of varying severity, including several dozen belched up from the planet's mantle, roughly equivalent to magnitude 3 or 4 quakes here on Earth, reports Ian Sample for the _Guardian_. On average, Mars seems to shake more than the moon, but still pales in comparison to helter-skelter Earth. Were they to happen on Earth, most marsquakes would barely be detectable, seismologist Philippe Lognonn\u00e9 tells Ben Guarino at the Washington Post. Still mysterious, however, is the origin of these extraterrestrial trembles. While earthbound quakes arise when our planet's tectonic plates grind up against one another, Mars lacks the same internal architecture, leaving researchers puzzled about the source of its quakes. But two temblors that appear to have arisen from a Martian structure called Cerberus Fossae, a series of deep surface fissures that were recently geologically and volcanically active, have provided researchers with hints, InSight deputy principal investigator Suzanne Smrekar tells the Washington Post. Based on InSight's data, researchers think pockets of magma may still be moving, cooling and contracting deep in the Red Planet's innards, causing cracks, then quivers, at its brittle rocky surface, reports Maya Wei-Haas for National Geographic. Also described in the new finds is a mysterious and persistent hum that pervades the Martian landscape. Though the slosh of Earth's oceans produces a comparable sound, scientists have yet to suss out a plausible cause for the Red Planet's curious tune. \"It's extremely puzzling,\" Banerdt tells National Geographic. Another surprise has come from data collected by InSight's magnetometer, which has picked up on a local magnetic field about ten times stronger than researchers expected to see. Though Mars once had a magnetic north and south like Earth, its internal dynamo, or liquid metal interior, stopped churning billions of years ago, stripping the planet of its global magnetic field. But magnetic minerals still exist in Martian rocks, locked in like a time capsule of the planet's long-gone magnetism. \"They're like little tape recorders,\" InSight team member Catherine Johnson told the Washington Post. Combined with a series of pulsating electric currents found in Mars' atmosphere, these blips of local magnetism may be the source of InSight's unexpected detection. \"This measurement was our first little tiny taste-one single point-of how much stronger the magnetization might be,\" Robert Lillis, a planetary space physicist at the University of California, Berkeley who wasn't involved in the studies tells _National Geographic. InSight is still fervently collecting data, which NASA is releasing to the public at three-month intervals. Once cache of results, though, has so far been conspicuously absent: readings from the craft's subterranean heat probe, nicknamed the \"mole,\" which has been unable to penetrate the cementlike soil that cakes InSight's landing site. Over the next couple months, mission team members will try to leverage the robot's arm to help the mole break ground, reports Mike Wall for Space.com. For the most part, though, things on the Red Planet remain on track, team members report. As Banerdt tells Space.com, \"I think we're well on our way to getting most, if not all, of the goals that we set for ourselves ten years ago when we started this mission.\" ", "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/insight-landers-first-big-batch-data-reveals-mars-seismic-activity-and-surprising-magnetism-180974268/"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight mission shows Mars is a seismically active world", "date": "2020-02-26", "content": "While one of its two science instruments remains sidelined, NASA's InSight probe has proven Mars is seismically active through the detection of hundreds of quakes, some of which can be traced to a volcanic region nearly 1,000 miles away. Since landing on Mars in November 2018, the InSight spacecraft's French-built seismometer has detected more than 450 seismic signals to date, according to NASA. Scientists believe the \"vast majority\" of the signals are probably from quakes, but some could be generated by wind. But none of the quakes registered by InSight have been stronger than magnitude 4.0, too weak to penetrate Mars' mantle and core and reveal insights about the red planet's deep interior. Data from the first year of results from NASA's InSight mission were published in six papers Monday. Scientists released the papers in in the scientific journals Nature and Nature Geoscience. InSight is the first mission to detect a \"marsquake\" on the red planet. The spacecraft landed on a broad equatorial plain in a region known as Elysium Planitia. \"The detections thus far are consistent with tectonic origins, with no impact- induced seismicity yet observed, and indicate a seismically active planet,\" the InSight science team wrote in Nature. The first batch of seismic measurements suggest Mars is \"moderately active\" with far more quakes than detected on the moon, scientists wrote in Nature. Mars lacks the tectonic plates responsible for the strongest seismic tremors on Earth, but evidence of volcanic activity on Mars in the recent geologic past could provide clues to one origin of the quakes registered by InSight. \"Mars trembles more often - but also more mildly - than expected,\" NASA said. Scientists traced the origin of two of the quakes to a region named Cerberus Fossae roughly 1,000 miles to the east of the InSight landing site. Images acquired by cameras orbiting Mars show faults and channels in the Cerberus Fossae region, evidence of lava flows and running water. Some of the volcanic flows at Cerberus Fossae occurred in the last 10 million years, scientists concluded due to the lack of fresh impact craters in the region. Landslides at Cerberus Fossae appear to indicate boulders may have been shaken loose by marsquakes, presumably tremors triggered by volcanic activity. \"It's just about the youngest tectonic feature on the planet,\" said Matt Golombek, a planetary geologist at JPL. \"The fact that we're seeing evidence of shaking in this region isn't a surprise, but it's very cool.\" Scientists believe InSight may landed on Mars during a relatively quiet period of seismic activity because it took several months for the probe to detect its first confirmed seismic signal. By the end of 2019, the mission's seismic instrument - named SEIS - was detecting around two seismic events per day. Meanwhile, InSight's other science instrument - an underground heat probe - continues having trouble hammering into the Martian soil. The German-built Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, instrument was supposed to burrow up to 16 feet into the Martian crust, deeper than any sensor from previous Mars missions. The HP3 instrument's self-hammering mole got stuck on the first day it began digging into the Martian soil. The soil at InSight's landing site appears to clump together rather than loosely fall around the mole as it hammers. Inspections using InSight's robot arm camera indicated the presence of 2 to 4 inches of duricrust, a type of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions, NASA officials said. The duricrust is also different from the soil the mole was designed for. The unique soil properties have caused the mole to bounce in place as it recoils from each stroke of its built in hammer mechanism, rather than dig deeper as designed. Last summer, ground controllers began using the scoop on the InSight lander's robotic arm to push against the side of the 16-inch-long spike as it resumed hammering into the ground. The pinning method appeared to help, but the mole backed out of the ground two times. Now mission managers have elected to try a more risky method to push on the back cap of the mole with the robotic arm as the spike hammers into the ground. Ground teams will take it slow with the new pushing method to avoid damaging an umbilical that trails behind the mole.

The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument on the InSight lander was to deploy a probe, or \"mole,\" into the surface of the planet, using a hammering mechanism to burrow as deep as five meters below the surface to measure the heat flow from the planet's interior. The probe, though, got stuck shortly after it started burrowing in February 2019, getting no deeper than about 30 centimeters. The project has tried several ways to get the mole moving into the surface again. Most recently, spacecraft controllers positioned the scoop on the end of the lander's robotic arm on top of the mole, pushing down on it to help it move into the surface and to prevent it from moving back out, which has happened in the past. That approach is working so far. \"The mole is going down by its hammering mechanism, but it is aided by the push of the scoop that balances the force of the recoil,\" said Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the instrument at the German space agency DLR, during a May 4 webinar about results from the mission that was part of the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, a conference that moved online because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the progress is slow because of the need to reposition the arm as the mole gets deeper. \"That is a very tedious operation,\" he said. \"We can only go like 1.5 centimeters at a time before we have to readjust.\" Another issue is the angle at which the mole is penetrating into the surface. The mole was originally designed to go down vertically, but is now at an angle of nearly 30 degrees from the vertical. \"It's not something we like to see,\" he said. If the mole is able to get completely below the surface, he expects that it will \"rectify itself to some extent.\" The problems have given scientists some insight into the properties of the surface at InSight's landing site. There is a \"duricrust\" about 20 centimeters thick, which he described as sand that has been cemented into place by salt. That duricrust didn't provide enough friction to keep the mole from recoiling as it tried to hammer into the surface initially. Another issue, he said, is that there is now a region of compacted sand created by the mole as it hammered in place without moving deeper. That will make it more difficult for the mole to penetrate into the surface, even with the assistance of the robotic arm. While Spohn didn't state how long the current effort to get the mole into the Martian surface would last, other project officials have suggested it may take a couple months. The latest effort had just started when Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the overall mission, gave a briefing at a meeting of NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group April 17, noting that the lander's other instruments, including its seismometer, were working well. \"We anticipate that we'll have the mole down flush with the ground within another month or two months,\" he said.

They hope that pushing down on the mole's top, also called the back cap, will keep it from backing out of its hole on Mars, as it did twice in recent months after nearly burying itself. Part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, the mole is a 16-inch-long spike equipped with an internal hammering mechanism.

The touchdown was \" flawless ,\" NASA employees announced that day. And in the 16 months since, InSight has proved itself to be well worth the effort. The lander's first big batch of data, described in a suite of studies published this week in Nature Geoscience and Nature Communications, has pulled back the curtain on many once-mysterious aspects of Mars, including its intriguing seismic activity and surprisingly strong magnetic field. Shortly after settling near the Martian equator a year and a half ago, InSight got busy, deploying an array of instruments, including several ultra-sensitive seismometers and a burrowing heat probe. In April 2019, InSight's seismometer detected its first marsquake : a subtle rumble that hinted that, despite its decidedly non-Earth-like geology, Mars' interior has its own terrestrial temper. \"We've finally, for the first time, established that Mars is a seismically active planet,\" InSight principal investigator and NASA planetary scientist Bruce Banerdt said during a teleconference on February 20. Since that first find, the lander has detected more than 450 other tremors of varying severity, including several dozen belched up from the planet's mantle, roughly equivalent to magnitude 3 or 4 quakes here on Earth, reports Ian Sample for the _Guardian_. On average, Mars seems to shake more than the moon, but still pales in comparison to helter-skelter Earth. Were they to happen on Earth, most marsquakes would barely be detectable, seismologist Philippe Lognonn\u00e9 tells Ben Guarino at the Washington Post. Still mysterious, however, is the origin of these extraterrestrial trembles. While earthbound quakes arise when our planet's tectonic plates grind up against one another, Mars lacks the same internal architecture, leaving researchers puzzled about the source of its quakes. But two temblors that appear to have arisen from a Martian structure called Cerberus Fossae, a series of deep surface fissures that were recently geologically and volcanically active, have provided researchers with hints, InSight deputy principal investigator Suzanne Smrekar tells the Washington Post. Based on InSight's data, researchers think pockets of magma may still be moving, cooling and contracting deep in the Red Planet's innards, causing cracks, then quivers, at its brittle rocky surface, reports Maya Wei-Haas for National Geographic. Also described in the new finds is a mysterious and persistent hum that pervades the Martian landscape. Though the slosh of Earth's oceans produces a comparable sound, scientists have yet to suss out a plausible cause for the Red Planet's curious tune. \"It's extremely puzzling,\" Banerdt tells National Geographic. Another surprise has come from data collected by InSight's magnetometer, which has picked up on a local magnetic field about ten times stronger than researchers expected to see. Though Mars once had a magnetic north and south like Earth, its internal dynamo, or liquid metal interior, stopped churning billions of years ago, stripping the planet of its global magnetic field. But magnetic minerals still exist in Martian rocks, locked in like a time capsule of the planet's long-gone magnetism. \"They're like little tape recorders,\" InSight team member Catherine Johnson told the Washington Post. Combined with a series of pulsating electric currents found in Mars' atmosphere, these blips of local magnetism may be the source of InSight's unexpected detection. \"This measurement was our first little tiny taste-one single point-of how much stronger the magnetization might be,\" Robert Lillis, a planetary space physicist at the University of California, Berkeley who wasn't involved in the studies tells _National Geographic. InSight is still fervently collecting data, which NASA is releasing to the public at three-month intervals. Once cache of results, though, has so far been conspicuously absent: readings from the craft's subterranean heat probe, nicknamed the \"mole,\" which has been unable to penetrate the cementlike soil that cakes InSight's landing site. Over the next couple months, mission team members will try to leverage the robot's arm to help the mole break ground, reports Mike Wall for Space.com. For the most part, though, things on the Red Planet remain on track, team members report. As Banerdt tells Space.com, \"I think we're well on our way to getting most, if not all, of the goals that we set for ourselves ten years ago when we started this mission.\" ", "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/insight-landers-first-big-batch-data-reveals-mars-seismic-activity-and-surprising-magnetism-180974268/"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight mission shows Mars is a seismically active world", "date": "2020-02-26", "content": "While one of its two science instruments remains sidelined, NASA's InSight probe has proven Mars is seismically active through the detection of hundreds of quakes, some of which can be traced to a volcanic region nearly 1,000 miles away. Since landing on Mars in November 2018, the InSight spacecraft's French-built seismometer has detected more than 450 seismic signals to date, according to NASA. Scientists believe the \"vast majority\" of the signals are probably from quakes, but some could be generated by wind. But none of the quakes registered by InSight have been stronger than magnitude 4.0, too weak to penetrate Mars' mantle and core and reveal insights about the red planet's deep interior. Data from the first year of results from NASA's InSight mission were published in six papers Monday. Scientists released the papers in in the scientific journals Nature and Nature Geoscience. InSight is the first mission to detect a \"marsquake\" on the red planet. The spacecraft landed on a broad equatorial plain in a region known as Elysium Planitia. \"The detections thus far are consistent with tectonic origins, with no impact- induced seismicity yet observed, and indicate a seismically active planet,\" the InSight science team wrote in Nature. The first batch of seismic measurements suggest Mars is \"moderately active\" with far more quakes than detected on the moon, scientists wrote in Nature. Mars lacks the tectonic plates responsible for the strongest seismic tremors on Earth, but evidence of volcanic activity on Mars in the recent geologic past could provide clues to one origin of the quakes registered by InSight. \"Mars trembles more often - but also more mildly - than expected,\" NASA said. Scientists traced the origin of two of the quakes to a region named Cerberus Fossae roughly 1,000 miles to the east of the InSight landing site. Images acquired by cameras orbiting Mars show faults and channels in the Cerberus Fossae region, evidence of lava flows and running water. Some of the volcanic flows at Cerberus Fossae occurred in the last 10 million years, scientists concluded due to the lack of fresh impact craters in the region. Landslides at Cerberus Fossae appear to indicate boulders may have been shaken loose by marsquakes, presumably tremors triggered by volcanic activity. \"It's just about the youngest tectonic feature on the planet,\" said Matt Golombek, a planetary geologist at JPL. \"The fact that we're seeing evidence of shaking in this region isn't a surprise, but it's very cool.\" Scientists believe InSight may landed on Mars during a relatively quiet period of seismic activity because it took several months for the probe to detect its first confirmed seismic signal. By the end of 2019, the mission's seismic instrument - named SEIS - was detecting around two seismic events per day. Meanwhile, InSight's other science instrument - an underground heat probe - continues having trouble hammering into the Martian soil. The German-built Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, instrument was supposed to burrow up to 16 feet into the Martian crust, deeper than any sensor from previous Mars missions. The HP3 instrument's self-hammering mole got stuck on the first day it began digging into the Martian soil. The soil at InSight's landing site appears to clump together rather than loosely fall around the mole as it hammers. Inspections using InSight's robot arm camera indicated the presence of 2 to 4 inches of duricrust, a type of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions, NASA officials said. The duricrust is also different from the soil the mole was designed for. The unique soil properties have caused the mole to bounce in place as it recoils from each stroke of its built in hammer mechanism, rather than dig deeper as designed. Last summer, ground controllers began using the scoop on the InSight lander's robotic arm to push against the side of the 16-inch-long spike as it resumed hammering into the ground. The pinning method appeared to help, but the mole backed out of the ground two times. Now mission managers have elected to try a more risky method to push on the back cap of the mole with the robotic arm as the spike hammers into the ground. Ground teams will take it slow with the new pushing method to avoid damaging an umbilical that trails behind the mole. The tether contains multiple temperature sensors to gather thermal data at various depths underneath the Martian surface, and cables to route science data back to the InSight lander for transmission to Earth. The heat flow measurements intended to be collected by the HP3 instrument are part of the $1 billion InSight mission's so-called \"Level 1\" requirements, but were listed as a stretch goal, not as a requirement for minimum mission success, according to Bruce Banerdt, the mission's principal investigator at JPL. \"NASA funds our mission and supports us, and in return, we sort of promise a certain number of scientific measurements and results,\" Banerdt said last year. \"We have about 10 of those for InSight. We call them our Level 1 requirements, and one of those Level 1 requirements is for a measurement of the heat flow of Mars using our HP3. The mission must meet at least six of the 10 Level 1 requirements to meet minimum success criteria, according to NASA officials. The InSight mission's third major science investigation is the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, or RISE. This experiment uses radio signals traveling between InSight and Earth receiving stations to track the wobble of Mars as it rotates, yielding insights into the planet's interior structure, including whether Mars has a liquid or solid core. Scientists have not yet made any conclusions from the RISE investigation. \"A solid core would cause Mars to wobble less than a liquid one would,\" NASA said. \"This first year of data is just a start. Watching over a full Martian year will give scientists a much better idea of the size and speed of the planet's wobble.\" Other data collected by InSight last year suggest rocks beneath the probe's landing site are more magnetized than scientists predicted. The magnetic signals are relics left over from when Mars had a magnetic field billions of years ago. The Martian magnetic field withered away, but rocks buried 200 feet to several miles beneath the planet's surface were magnetized by the field. Rocks closer to the surface are too young to carry the remnant magnetism. InSight carried the first magnetometer to the surface of Mars to investigate how the magnetic field's ancient impacts can still be sensed today. The initial InSight results indicate the magnetism coming from the deep rock layers is 10 times stronger than expected. \"This magnetism must be coming from ancient rocks underground,\" said Catherine Johnson, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and the Planetary Science Institute. \"We're combining these data with what we know from seismology and geology to understand the magnetized layers below InSight. How strong or deep would they have to be for us to detect this field?\" Weather sensors on InSight have detected thousands of whirlwinds passing over the lander in its first year on Mars. The mission's flat landing site has more whirlwinds than other place on Mars with weather instruments, but InSight's cameras have not spotted any dust devils, which occur when the spinning winds pick up grit and become visible, according to NASA.

The InSight lander, which is currently on Mars, faced unexpected problems when its 38cm digging probe - also called a mole - became stuck in the soil. After a few failed attempts, the mole was freed - thanks to NASA encouraging it to \"hit itself\" with the jackhammer-like shovel. The risk of the operation was that it could have damaged the tether strap that provides power and communications from the lander to the mole. It is attached to the back part of the mole. The InSight's mission is to study temperature changes under the surface of Mars, in an attempt to understand how similar Mars' core is to Earth's. The mole is designed to dig down as far as 5m. Sensors in the mole detect the temperatures down in the burrow and send this information back to the InSight lander via the tether strap. The mole got stuck on February 28, 2019, the first day of digging. The mole needs friction from loose soil around it to travel downward. Without friction, it springs back from its self-hammering and just bounces up and down in the one place. First, the InSight team tried pinning, which is using the robotic arm's scoop to press on the side of the mole, adding just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile tether strap. Pinning helped but the mole popped back out of the Martian soil on two occasions, possibly from soil building up from beneath. A further option would be to use the shovel to move more soil into the hole where the mole is digging to help it work as it was designed to. 1. What is the Mars landing craft called? 2.

The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument on the InSight lander was to deploy a probe, or \"mole,\" into the surface of the planet, using a hammering mechanism to burrow as deep as five meters below the surface to measure the heat flow from the planet's interior. The probe, though, got stuck shortly after it started burrowing in February 2019, getting no deeper than about 30 centimeters. The project has tried several ways to get the mole moving into the surface again. Most recently, spacecraft controllers positioned the scoop on the end of the lander's robotic arm on top of the mole, pushing down on it to help it move into the surface and to prevent it from moving back out, which has happened in the past. That approach is working so far. \"The mole is going down by its hammering mechanism, but it is aided by the push of the scoop that balances the force of the recoil,\" said Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the instrument at the German space agency DLR, during a May 4 webinar about results from the mission that was part of the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, a conference that moved online because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the progress is slow because of the need to reposition the arm as the mole gets deeper. \"That is a very tedious operation,\" he said. \"We can only go like 1.5 centimeters at a time before we have to readjust.\" Another issue is the angle at which the mole is penetrating into the surface. The mole was originally designed to go down vertically, but is now at an angle of nearly 30 degrees from the vertical. \"It's not something we like to see,\" he said. If the mole is able to get completely below the surface, he expects that it will \"rectify itself to some extent.\" The problems have given scientists some insight into the properties of the surface at InSight's landing site. There is a \"duricrust\" about 20 centimeters thick, which he described as sand that has been cemented into place by salt. That duricrust didn't provide enough friction to keep the mole from recoiling as it tried to hammer into the surface initially. Another issue, he said, is that there is now a region of compacted sand created by the mole as it hammered in place without moving deeper. That will make it more difficult for the mole to penetrate into the surface, even with the assistance of the robotic arm. While Spohn didn't state how long the current effort to get the mole into the Martian surface would last, other project officials have suggested it may take a couple months. The latest effort had just started when Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the overall mission, gave a briefing at a meeting of NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group April 17, noting that the lander's other instruments, including its seismometer, were working well. \"We anticipate that we'll have the mole down flush with the ground within another month or two months,\" he said. By then, the arm will no longer be able to help push the mole further into the ground. \"At that point, it's either going to be able to go on its own or not.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/insight-mole-making-slow-progress-into-martian-surface/"}, {"title": "The 'mole' on Mars is finally underground after a push from NASA's InSight lander", "date": "2020-06-05", "content": "There's a light at the end of the tunnel for the first mole to burrow into the surface of Mars, scientists hope. Not a furry mole, of course; the term is the nickname for the instrument formally known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package on board NASA's InSight lander mission. The lander, which touched down on Mars in November 2018, is designed to give scientists a look inside the Red Planet and gather data to help them understand its geology and internal structure. The mole is one of the lander's three key tools to accomplish that - but for more than a year, mission personnel have struggled to deploy it. But after serious challenges, the mole has finally reached a new milestone. \"After several assists from my robotic arm, the mole appears to be underground,\" the official Twitter account for the mission wrote yesterday. \"It's been a real challenge troubleshooting from millions of miles away. We still need to see if the mole can dig on its own.\" The mole consists of a drillbit-like assembly full of heat sensors that are attached to the main body of the lander by a taillike tether. The instrument is designed to hammer itself up to 16 feet into the Martian surface near InSight's home in a region called Elysium Planitia. The idea is that as it burrows down, the mole's temperature sensors will study the rock it digs through and evaluate how energy moves out from the planet's core. It's a completely new type of instrument for Mars but, although the team tested it extensively in chambers of dirt on Earth, such analogs can never precisely match circumstances on the Red Planet. And so, just about as soon as the mole set out on its Martian dig, it struggled, getting stuck or backing out. Since then, InSight personnel have tried a range of tactics to get the mole digging successfully, running into obstacles every time. The most recent technique involved using an arm on the lander to gently push the end of the mole as it dug to keep the probe from bouncing out. That's a delicate proposition since the InSight team needed to be careful to not damage the tether connecting the mole to the lander. But according to a new blog post from Tilman Spohn, the German space agency scientist leading the mole team, this technique finally yielded some progress. The mole is now nearly entirely buried in the Martian soil, he wrote, with the scoop at the end of the lander arm near the surface. All told, that means the mole has moved about 2.8 inches into the rock between March 11 and May 30. Next will come what the team calls the \"free-mole\" test, as the instrument progresses deeper than the lander's arm can assist. From now on, the mole will have to make its own way; whether it can likely depends on how much traction it can find in the column of dust and rock surrounding it. However, external forces may soon interfere with the mole campaign, according to the blog post. \"Winter is approaching on Mars' northern hemisphere and dust storm season will begin soon,\" Spohn wrote. \"The atmosphere is already getting dustier and the power generated by the solar panels is decreasing. This may affect our ability to performing energy consuming operations with the arm in the near future. Stay tuned and keep your fingers crossed.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/insight-mars-lander-pushes-mole-into-red-planet.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Mars InSight Lander to Push on Top of the 'Mole'", "date": "2020-02-21", "content": "After nearly a year of trying to dig into the Martian surface, the heat probe belonging to NASA's InSight lander is about to get a push.

But two temblors that appear to have arisen from a Martian structure called Cerberus Fossae, a series of deep surface fissures that were recently geologically and volcanically active, have provided researchers with hints, InSight deputy principal investigator Suzanne Smrekar tells the Washington Post. Based on InSight's data, researchers think pockets of magma may still be moving, cooling and contracting deep in the Red Planet's innards, causing cracks, then quivers, at its brittle rocky surface, reports Maya Wei-Haas for National Geographic. Also described in the new finds is a mysterious and persistent hum that pervades the Martian landscape. Though the slosh of Earth's oceans produces a comparable sound, scientists have yet to suss out a plausible cause for the Red Planet's curious tune. \"It's extremely puzzling,\" Banerdt tells National Geographic. Another surprise has come from data collected by InSight's magnetometer, which has picked up on a local magnetic field about ten times stronger than researchers expected to see. Though Mars once had a magnetic north and south like Earth, its internal dynamo, or liquid metal interior, stopped churning billions of years ago, stripping the planet of its global magnetic field. But magnetic minerals still exist in Martian rocks, locked in like a time capsule of the planet's long-gone magnetism. \"They're like little tape recorders,\" InSight team member Catherine Johnson told the Washington Post. Combined with a series of pulsating electric currents found in Mars' atmosphere, these blips of local magnetism may be the source of InSight's unexpected detection. \"This measurement was our first little tiny taste-one single point-of how much stronger the magnetization might be,\" Robert Lillis, a planetary space physicist at the University of California, Berkeley who wasn't involved in the studies tells _National Geographic. InSight is still fervently collecting data, which NASA is releasing to the public at three-month intervals. Once cache of results, though, has so far been conspicuously absent: readings from the craft's subterranean heat probe, nicknamed the \"mole,\" which has been unable to penetrate the cementlike soil that cakes InSight's landing site. Over the next couple months, mission team members will try to leverage the robot's arm to help the mole break ground, reports Mike Wall for Space.com. For the most part, though, things on the Red Planet remain on track, team members report. As Banerdt tells Space.com, \"I think we're well on our way to getting most, if not all, of the goals that we set for ourselves ten years ago when we started this mission.\" ", "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/insight-landers-first-big-batch-data-reveals-mars-seismic-activity-and-surprising-magnetism-180974268/"}, {"title": "NASA's InSight mission shows Mars is a seismically active world", "date": "2020-02-26", "content": "While one of its two science instruments remains sidelined, NASA's InSight probe has proven Mars is seismically active through the detection of hundreds of quakes, some of which can be traced to a volcanic region nearly 1,000 miles away. Since landing on Mars in November 2018, the InSight spacecraft's French-built seismometer has detected more than 450 seismic signals to date, according to NASA. Scientists believe the \"vast majority\" of the signals are probably from quakes, but some could be generated by wind. But none of the quakes registered by InSight have been stronger than magnitude 4.0, too weak to penetrate Mars' mantle and core and reveal insights about the red planet's deep interior. Data from the first year of results from NASA's InSight mission were published in six papers Monday. Scientists released the papers in in the scientific journals Nature and Nature Geoscience. InSight is the first mission to detect a \"marsquake\" on the red planet. The spacecraft landed on a broad equatorial plain in a region known as Elysium Planitia. \"The detections thus far are consistent with tectonic origins, with no impact- induced seismicity yet observed, and indicate a seismically active planet,\" the InSight science team wrote in Nature. The first batch of seismic measurements suggest Mars is \"moderately active\" with far more quakes than detected on the moon, scientists wrote in Nature. Mars lacks the tectonic plates responsible for the strongest seismic tremors on Earth, but evidence of volcanic activity on Mars in the recent geologic past could provide clues to one origin of the quakes registered by InSight. \"Mars trembles more often - but also more mildly - than expected,\" NASA said. Scientists traced the origin of two of the quakes to a region named Cerberus Fossae roughly 1,000 miles to the east of the InSight landing site. Images acquired by cameras orbiting Mars show faults and channels in the Cerberus Fossae region, evidence of lava flows and running water. Some of the volcanic flows at Cerberus Fossae occurred in the last 10 million years, scientists concluded due to the lack of fresh impact craters in the region. Landslides at Cerberus Fossae appear to indicate boulders may have been shaken loose by marsquakes, presumably tremors triggered by volcanic activity. \"It's just about the youngest tectonic feature on the planet,\" said Matt Golombek, a planetary geologist at JPL. \"The fact that we're seeing evidence of shaking in this region isn't a surprise, but it's very cool.\" Scientists believe InSight may landed on Mars during a relatively quiet period of seismic activity because it took several months for the probe to detect its first confirmed seismic signal. By the end of 2019, the mission's seismic instrument - named SEIS - was detecting around two seismic events per day. Meanwhile, InSight's other science instrument - an underground heat probe - continues having trouble hammering into the Martian soil. The German-built Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, instrument was supposed to burrow up to 16 feet into the Martian crust, deeper than any sensor from previous Mars missions. The HP3 instrument's self-hammering mole got stuck on the first day it began digging into the Martian soil. The soil at InSight's landing site appears to clump together rather than loosely fall around the mole as it hammers. Inspections using InSight's robot arm camera indicated the presence of 2 to 4 inches of duricrust, a type of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions, NASA officials said. The duricrust is also different from the soil the mole was designed for. The unique soil properties have caused the mole to bounce in place as it recoils from each stroke of its built in hammer mechanism, rather than dig deeper as designed. Last summer, ground controllers began using the scoop on the InSight lander's robotic arm to push against the side of the 16-inch-long spike as it resumed hammering into the ground. The pinning method appeared to help, but the mole backed out of the ground two times. Now mission managers have elected to try a more risky method to push on the back cap of the mole with the robotic arm as the spike hammers into the ground. Ground teams will take it slow with the new pushing method to avoid damaging an umbilical that trails behind the mole. The tether contains multiple temperature sensors to gather thermal data at various depths underneath the Martian surface, and cables to route science data back to the InSight lander for transmission to Earth. The heat flow measurements intended to be collected by the HP3 instrument are part of the $1 billion InSight mission's so-called \"Level 1\" requirements, but were listed as a stretch goal, not as a requirement for minimum mission success, according to Bruce Banerdt, the mission's principal investigator at JPL. \"NASA funds our mission and supports us, and in return, we sort of promise a certain number of scientific measurements and results,\" Banerdt said last year. \"We have about 10 of those for InSight. We call them our Level 1 requirements, and one of those Level 1 requirements is for a measurement of the heat flow of Mars using our HP3. The mission must meet at least six of the 10 Level 1 requirements to meet minimum success criteria, according to NASA officials. The InSight mission's third major science investigation is the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, or RISE. This experiment uses radio signals traveling between InSight and Earth receiving stations to track the wobble of Mars as it rotates, yielding insights into the planet's interior structure, including whether Mars has a liquid or solid core. Scientists have not yet made any conclusions from the RISE investigation. \"A solid core would cause Mars to wobble less than a liquid one would,\" NASA said. \"This first year of data is just a start. Watching over a full Martian year will give scientists a much better idea of the size and speed of the planet's wobble.\" Other data collected by InSight last year suggest rocks beneath the probe's landing site are more magnetized than scientists predicted. The magnetic signals are relics left over from when Mars had a magnetic field billions of years ago. The Martian magnetic field withered away, but rocks buried 200 feet to several miles beneath the planet's surface were magnetized by the field. Rocks closer to the surface are too young to carry the remnant magnetism. InSight carried the first magnetometer to the surface of Mars to investigate how the magnetic field's ancient impacts can still be sensed today. The initial InSight results indicate the magnetism coming from the deep rock layers is 10 times stronger than expected. \"This magnetism must be coming from ancient rocks underground,\" said Catherine Johnson, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and the Planetary Science Institute. \"We're combining these data with what we know from seismology and geology to understand the magnetized layers below InSight. How strong or deep would they have to be for us to detect this field?\" Weather sensors on InSight have detected thousands of whirlwinds passing over the lander in its first year on Mars. The mission's flat landing site has more whirlwinds than other place on Mars with weather instruments, but InSight's cameras have not spotted any dust devils, which occur when the spinning winds pick up grit and become visible, according to NASA.

The InSight lander, which is currently on Mars, faced unexpected problems when its 38cm digging probe - also called a mole - became stuck in the soil.

The risk of the operation was that it could have damaged the tether strap that provides power and communications from the lander to the mole. It is attached to the back part of the mole. The InSight's mission is to study temperature changes under the surface of Mars, in an attempt to understand how similar Mars' core is to Earth's. The mole is designed to dig down as far as 5m. Sensors in the mole detect the temperatures down in the burrow and send this information back to the InSight lander via the tether strap. The mole got stuck on February 28, 2019, the first day of digging. The mole needs friction from loose soil around it to travel downward. Without friction, it springs back from its self-hammering and just bounces up and down in the one place. First, the InSight team tried pinning, which is using the robotic arm's scoop to press on the side of the mole, adding just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile tether strap.

The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument on the InSight lander was to deploy a probe, or \"mole,\" into the surface of the planet, using a hammering mechanism to burrow as deep as five meters below the surface to measure the heat flow from the planet's interior. The probe, though, got stuck shortly after it started burrowing in February 2019, getting no deeper than about 30 centimeters. The project has tried several ways to get the mole moving into the surface again. Most recently, spacecraft controllers positioned the scoop on the end of the lander's robotic arm on top of the mole, pushing down on it to help it move into the surface and to prevent it from moving back out, which has happened in the past. That approach is working so far. \"The mole is going down by its hammering mechanism, but it is aided by the push of the scoop that balances the force of the recoil,\" said Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the instrument at the German space agency DLR, during a May 4 webinar about results from the mission that was part of the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, a conference that moved online because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the progress is slow because of the need to reposition the arm as the mole gets deeper. \"That is a very tedious operation,\" he said. \"We can only go like 1.5 centimeters at a time before we have to readjust.\" Another issue is the angle at which the mole is penetrating into the surface. The mole was originally designed to go down vertically, but is now at an angle of nearly 30 degrees from the vertical. \"It's not something we like to see,\" he said. If the mole is able to get completely below the surface, he expects that it will \"rectify itself to some extent.\" The problems have given scientists some insight into the properties of the surface at InSight's landing site. There is a \"duricrust\" about 20 centimeters thick, which he described as sand that has been cemented into place by salt. That duricrust didn't provide enough friction to keep the mole from recoiling as it tried to hammer into the surface initially. Another issue, he said, is that there is now a region of compacted sand created by the mole as it hammered in place without moving deeper. That will make it more difficult for the mole to penetrate into the surface, even with the assistance of the robotic arm. While Spohn didn't state how long the current effort to get the mole into the Martian surface would last, other project officials have suggested it may take a couple months. The latest effort had just started when Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the overall mission, gave a briefing at a meeting of NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group April 17, noting that the lander's other instruments, including its seismometer, were working well. \"We anticipate that we'll have the mole down flush with the ground within another month or two months,\" he said. By then, the arm will no longer be able to help push the mole further into the ground. \"At that point, it's either going to be able to go on its own or not.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/insight-mole-making-slow-progress-into-martian-surface/"}, {"title": "The 'mole' on Mars is finally underground after a push from NASA's InSight lander", "date": "2020-06-05", "content": "There's a light at the end of the tunnel for the first mole to burrow into the surface of Mars, scientists hope. Not a furry mole, of course; the term is the nickname for the instrument formally known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package on board NASA's InSight lander mission. The lander, which touched down on Mars in November 2018, is designed to give scientists a look inside the Red Planet and gather data to help them understand its geology and internal structure. The mole is one of the lander's three key tools to accomplish that - but for more than a year, mission personnel have struggled to deploy it. But after serious challenges, the mole has finally reached a new milestone. \"After several assists from my robotic arm, the mole appears to be underground,\" the official Twitter account for the mission wrote yesterday. \"It's been a real challenge troubleshooting from millions of miles away. We still need to see if the mole can dig on its own.\" The mole consists of a drillbit-like assembly full of heat sensors that are attached to the main body of the lander by a taillike tether. The instrument is designed to hammer itself up to 16 feet into the Martian surface near InSight's home in a region called Elysium Planitia. The idea is that as it burrows down, the mole's temperature sensors will study the rock it digs through and evaluate how energy moves out from the planet's core. It's a completely new type of instrument for Mars but, although the team tested it extensively in chambers of dirt on Earth, such analogs can never precisely match circumstances on the Red Planet. And so, just about as soon as the mole set out on its Martian dig, it struggled, getting stuck or backing out. Since then, InSight personnel have tried a range of tactics to get the mole digging successfully, running into obstacles every time. The most recent technique involved using an arm on the lander to gently push the end of the mole as it dug to keep the probe from bouncing out. That's a delicate proposition since the InSight team needed to be careful to not damage the tether connecting the mole to the lander. But according to a new blog post from Tilman Spohn, the German space agency scientist leading the mole team, this technique finally yielded some progress. The mole is now nearly entirely buried in the Martian soil, he wrote, with the scoop at the end of the lander arm near the surface. All told, that means the mole has moved about 2.8 inches into the rock between March 11 and May 30. Next will come what the team calls the \"free-mole\" test, as the instrument progresses deeper than the lander's arm can assist. From now on, the mole will have to make its own way; whether it can likely depends on how much traction it can find in the column of dust and rock surrounding it. However, external forces may soon interfere with the mole campaign, according to the blog post. \"Winter is approaching on Mars' northern hemisphere and dust storm season will begin soon,\" Spohn wrote. \"The atmosphere is already getting dustier and the power generated by the solar panels is decreasing. This may affect our ability to performing energy consuming operations with the arm in the near future. Stay tuned and keep your fingers crossed.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/insight-mars-lander-pushes-mole-into-red-planet.html"}, {"title": "The 'mole' on Mars from NASA's InSight lander may be stuck again", "date": "2020-07-08", "content": "The Martian mole is underground again, but it may still not be able to dig on its own. The burrowing heat probe onboard NASA's InSight Mars lander, affectionately known as \"the mole,\" was designed to hammer itself at least 10 feet underground. But the going has been tough for the mole since its February 2019 deployment, perhaps as a result of weird soil properties at the landing site. The mole, whose official name is the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, recently got underground once again, thanks to a push from the scoop on the end of InSight's robotic arm. But new photos suggest that the mole might be stuck in its new spot just beneath the surface. The movement of sand grains in the scoop on the end of NASA InSight's robotic arm suggests that the spacecraft's self-hammering \"mole,\" which is in the soil beneath the scoop, had begun tapping the bottom of the scoop while hammering on June 20, 2020. The movement of sand grains in the scoop on the end of NASA InSight's robotic arm suggests that the spacecraft's self-hammering \"mole,\" which is in the soil beneath the scoop, had begun tapping the bottom of the scoop while hammering on June 20, 2020. \"Images taken by InSight during a Saturday, June 20, hammering session show bits of soil jostling within the scoop - possible evidence that the mole had begun bouncing in place, knocking the bottom of the scoop,\" NASA officials wrote in an update Tuesday. The InSight team can't fully assess the situation at the moment, because the scoop is blocking the mole from the view of a camera on the lander's arm. InSight's handlers plan to move the scoop out of the way over the next few weeks to get a good look at the mole and its burrow, NASA officials said. Team members also plan to use that camera soon to image InSight's solar panels, something they haven't done since July 2019. It's the dusty season in InSight's locale just north of the Martian equator, and mission engineers want to get a better sense of the lander's power supply. It's too soon to say what mole-aiding steps the team will take next. But one possibility involves moving nearby soil into the mole's pit to give the digger more friction, NASA officials said. The mole needs friction to bury itself deeper, and friction is apparently hard to come by in the cement-like \"duracrust\" beneath InSight's legs. InSight landed on Mars in November 2018 to take an unprecedented look into the planet's deep interior, gathering information that will help scientists better understand the structure, formation and evolution of rocky planets. The mole, which was provided by the German Aerospace Center, is one of two main science instruments onboard the lander. The other is a suite of incredibly sensitive seismometers provided by the French space agency CNES and its partners. The seismometers have already detected more than 480 seismic signals. The detection rate has dropped significantly recently, a change that's likely tied to seasonal variations in atmospheric turbulence. This turbulence creates \"noise\" that swamps the signals of small marsquakes, NASA officials said. The InSight team is also precisely tracking the lander's position on Mars. This work, done via analysis of InSight's communications, reveals how much Mars wobbles as it circles the sun. This information, in turn, will shed light on the size and composition of the Red Planet's core, NASA officials have said.

NASA's InSight lander has been using its robotic arm to help the heat probe known as the \"mole\" burrow into Mars. The mission is providing the first look at the Red Planet's deep interior to reveal details about the formation of Mars and, ultimately, all rocky planets, including Earth. Akin to a 16-inch-long pile driver, the self-hammering mole has experienced difficulty getting into the Martian soil since February 2019. It's mostly buried now, thanks to recent efforts to push down on the mole with the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. But whether it will be able to dig deep enough - at least 10 feet - to get an accurate temperature reading of the planet remains to be seen. Images taken by InSight during a Saturday, June 20, hammering session show bits of soil jostling within the scoop - possible evidence that the mole had begun bouncing in place, knocking the bottom of the scoop. While the campaign to save the mole continues, the arm will be used to help carry out other science and engineering work. Here's what you can expect in the months ahead from the mission, which is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. What's next for the mole? The mole is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, that the German Aerospace Center provided NASA. While the scoop on the end of InSight's arm has blocked the mole from backing out of its pit again, it also blocks the arm's camera from seeing the mole and the pit that has formed around it. Over the next few weeks, the team will move the arm out of the way to better assess how the soil and mole are interacting. After the scoop on the end of NASA's Mars InSight lander was used to push down on the top of the spacecraft's \"mole,\" or self-hammering heat probe, it was held in place to essentially block the mole from popping out of the soil. The movement of sand grains in the scoop, seen here, suggested that the mole had began bumping up against the bottom of the scoop while hammering on June 20, 2020. The mole needs friction from soil in order to burrow. Ironically, loose soil provides that friction as it collapses around the mole. But the soil beneath InSight has proven to be cement-like duricrust, with dirt granules that stick together. As a result, recoil from the mole's self-hammering action causes it to bounce in place. So the team's next moves may be to provide that friction by scraping or chopping nearby soil to move it into the pit it's in. More thoughts about the mole's recent progress can be found on a blog written by HP3's principal investigator, Tilman Spohn of DLR. What's next for InSight's arm? InSight landed on Mars on November 26, 2018. Its robotic arm subsequently set HP3, a seismometer and the seismometer's Wind and Thermal Shield on to the planet's surface. While the arm has been key to helping the mole, scientists and engineers are eager to use the arm's camera to pan over InSight's solar panels, something they haven't done since July 17, 2019. It's the dusty season on Mars, and the panels are likely coated with a fine layer of reddish-brown particles. Estimating how much dust is on the solar panels will let engineers better understand InSight's daily power supply. Scientists also want to resume using the arm to spot meteors streaking across the night sky, as they did earlier in the mission. Doing so could help them predict how often meteors strike this part of the planet. They could also cross-check to see whether data from InSight's seismometer reveals a meteor impact on Mars shortly afterward. What's next for the seismometer? InSight's seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, detected its first marsquake nearly three months after starting its measurements in January 2019. By the fall of 2019, it was detecting a potential quake or two per day. While SEIS has detected more than 480 seismic signals overall, the rate has dropped to less than one per week. This rate change is tied to seasonal variations of atmospheric turbulence, which creates noise that covers up the tiny quake signals. Despite the protective Wind and Thermal Shield, SEIS is sensitive enough that shaking from the wind hitting the shield can make quakes harder to isolate.

But after serious challenges, the mole has finally reached a new milestone. \"After several assists from my robotic arm, the mole appears to be underground,\" the official Twitter account for the mission wrote yesterday. \"It's been a real challenge troubleshooting from millions of miles away. We still need to see if the mole can dig on its own.\" The mole consists of a drillbit-like assembly full of heat sensors that are attached to the main body of the lander by a taillike tether. The instrument is designed to hammer itself up to 16 feet into the Martian surface near InSight's home in a region called Elysium Planitia. The idea is that as it burrows down, the mole's temperature sensors will study the rock it digs through and evaluate how energy moves out from the planet's core. It's a completely new type of instrument for Mars but, although the team tested it extensively in chambers of dirt on Earth, such analogs can never precisely match circumstances on the Red Planet. And so, just about as soon as the mole set out on its Martian dig, it struggled, getting stuck or backing out. Since then, InSight personnel have tried a range of tactics to get the mole digging successfully, running into obstacles every time. The most recent technique involved using an arm on the lander to gently push the end of the mole as it dug to keep the probe from bouncing out. That's a delicate proposition since the InSight team needed to be careful to not damage the tether connecting the mole to the lander. But according to a new blog post from Tilman Spohn, the German space agency scientist leading the mole team, this technique finally yielded some progress. The mole is now nearly entirely buried in the Martian soil, he wrote, with the scoop at the end of the lander arm near the surface. All told, that means the mole has moved about 2.8 inches into the rock between March 11 and May 30. Next will come what the team calls the \"free-mole\" test, as the instrument progresses deeper than the lander's arm can assist. From now on, the mole will have to make its own way; whether it can likely depends on how much traction it can find in the column of dust and rock surrounding it. However, external forces may soon interfere with the mole campaign, according to the blog post. \"Winter is approaching on Mars' northern hemisphere and dust storm season will begin soon,\" Spohn wrote. \"The atmosphere is already getting dustier and the power generated by the solar panels is decreasing. This may affect our ability to performing energy consuming operations with the arm in the near future.

The mole, whose official name is the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, recently got underground once again, thanks to a push from the scoop on the end of InSight's robotic arm.

The InSight team can't fully assess the situation at the moment, because the scoop is blocking the mole from the view of a camera on the lander's arm. InSight's handlers plan to move the scoop out of the way over the next few weeks to get a good look at the mole and its burrow, NASA officials said. Team members also plan to use that camera soon to image InSight's solar panels, something they haven't done since July 2019. It's the dusty season in InSight's locale just north of the Martian equator, and mission engineers want to get a better sense of the lander's power supply. It's too soon to say what mole-aiding steps the team will take next. But one possibility involves moving nearby soil into the mole's pit to give the digger more friction, NASA officials said. The mole needs friction to bury itself deeper, and friction is apparently hard to come by in the cement-like \"duracrust\" beneath InSight's legs. InSight landed on Mars in November 2018 to take an unprecedented look into the planet's deep interior, gathering information that will help scientists better understand the structure, formation and evolution of rocky planets. The mole, which was provided by the German Aerospace Center, is one of two main science instruments onboard the lander. The other is a suite of incredibly sensitive seismometers provided by the French space agency CNES and its partners. The seismometers have already detected more than 480 seismic signals. The detection rate has dropped significantly recently, a change that's likely tied to seasonal variations in atmospheric turbulence. This turbulence creates \"noise\" that swamps the signals of small marsquakes, NASA officials said. The InSight team is also precisely tracking the lander's position on Mars. This work, done via analysis of InSight's communications, reveals how much Mars wobbles as it circles the sun. This information, in turn, will shed light on the size and composition of the Red Planet's core, NASA officials have said.

NASA's InSight lander has been using its robotic arm to help the heat probe known as the \"mole\" burrow into Mars. The mission is providing the first look at the Red Planet's deep interior to reveal details about the formation of Mars and, ultimately, all rocky planets, including Earth. Akin to a 16-inch-long pile driver, the self-hammering mole has experienced difficulty getting into the Martian soil since February 2019. It's mostly buried now, thanks to recent efforts to push down on the mole with the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. But whether it will be able to dig deep enough - at least 10 feet - to get an accurate temperature reading of the planet remains to be seen. Images taken by InSight during a Saturday, June 20, hammering session show bits of soil jostling within the scoop - possible evidence that the mole had begun bouncing in place, knocking the bottom of the scoop. While the campaign to save the mole continues, the arm will be used to help carry out other science and engineering work. Here's what you can expect in the months ahead from the mission, which is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. What's next for the mole? The mole is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, that the German Aerospace Center provided NASA. While the scoop on the end of InSight's arm has blocked the mole from backing out of its pit again, it also blocks the arm's camera from seeing the mole and the pit that has formed around it. Over the next few weeks, the team will move the arm out of the way to better assess how the soil and mole are interacting. After the scoop on the end of NASA's Mars InSight lander was used to push down on the top of the spacecraft's \"mole,\" or self-hammering heat probe, it was held in place to essentially block the mole from popping out of the soil. The movement of sand grains in the scoop, seen here, suggested that the mole had began bumping up against the bottom of the scoop while hammering on June 20, 2020. The mole needs friction from soil in order to burrow. Ironically, loose soil provides that friction as it collapses around the mole. But the soil beneath InSight has proven to be cement-like duricrust, with dirt granules that stick together. As a result, recoil from the mole's self-hammering action causes it to bounce in place. So the team's next moves may be to provide that friction by scraping or chopping nearby soil to move it into the pit it's in. More thoughts about the mole's recent progress can be found on a blog written by HP3's principal investigator, Tilman Spohn of DLR. What's next for InSight's arm? InSight landed on Mars on November 26, 2018. Its robotic arm subsequently set HP3, a seismometer and the seismometer's Wind and Thermal Shield on to the planet's surface. While the arm has been key to helping the mole, scientists and engineers are eager to use the arm's camera to pan over InSight's solar panels, something they haven't done since July 17, 2019. It's the dusty season on Mars, and the panels are likely coated with a fine layer of reddish-brown particles. Estimating how much dust is on the solar panels will let engineers better understand InSight's daily power supply. Scientists also want to resume using the arm to spot meteors streaking across the night sky, as they did earlier in the mission. Doing so could help them predict how often meteors strike this part of the planet. They could also cross-check to see whether data from InSight's seismometer reveals a meteor impact on Mars shortly afterward. What's next for the seismometer? InSight's seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, detected its first marsquake nearly three months after starting its measurements in January 2019. By the fall of 2019, it was detecting a potential quake or two per day. While SEIS has detected more than 480 seismic signals overall, the rate has dropped to less than one per week. This rate change is tied to seasonal variations of atmospheric turbulence, which creates noise that covers up the tiny quake signals. Despite the protective Wind and Thermal Shield, SEIS is sensitive enough that shaking from the wind hitting the shield can make quakes harder to isolate.

The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package instrument on the InSight lander was to deploy a probe, or \"mole,\" into the surface of the planet, using a hammering mechanism to burrow as deep as five meters below the surface to measure the heat flow from the planet's interior. The probe, though, got stuck shortly after it started burrowing in February 2019, getting no deeper than about 30 centimeters. The project has tried several ways to get the mole moving into the surface again. Most recently, spacecraft controllers positioned the scoop on the end of the lander's robotic arm on top of the mole, pushing down on it to help it move into the surface and to prevent it from moving back out, which has happened in the past. That approach is working so far. \"The mole is going down by its hammering mechanism, but it is aided by the push of the scoop that balances the force of the recoil,\" said Tilman Spohn, principal investigator for the instrument at the German space agency DLR, during a May 4 webinar about results from the mission that was part of the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, a conference that moved online because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the progress is slow because of the need to reposition the arm as the mole gets deeper. \"That is a very tedious operation,\" he said. \"We can only go like 1.5 centimeters at a time before we have to readjust.\" Another issue is the angle at which the mole is penetrating into the surface. The mole was originally designed to go down vertically, but is now at an angle of nearly 30 degrees from the vertical. \"It's not something we like to see,\" he said. If the mole is able to get completely below the surface, he expects that it will \"rectify itself to some extent.\" The problems have given scientists some insight into the properties of the surface at InSight's landing site. There is a \"duricrust\" about 20 centimeters thick, which he described as sand that has been cemented into place by salt. That duricrust didn't provide enough friction to keep the mole from recoiling as it tried to hammer into the surface initially. Another issue, he said, is that there is now a region of compacted sand created by the mole as it hammered in place without moving deeper. That will make it more difficult for the mole to penetrate into the surface, even with the assistance of the robotic arm. While Spohn didn't state how long the current effort to get the mole into the Martian surface would last, other project officials have suggested it may take a couple months. The latest effort had just started when Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the overall mission, gave a briefing at a meeting of NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group April 17, noting that the lander's other instruments, including its seismometer, were working well. \"We anticipate that we'll have the mole down flush with the ground within another month or two months,\" he said. By then, the arm will no longer be able to help push the mole further into the ground. \"At that point, it's either going to be able to go on its own or not.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/insight-mole-making-slow-progress-into-martian-surface/"}, {"title": "The 'mole' on Mars is finally underground after a push from NASA's InSight lander", "date": "2020-06-05", "content": "There's a light at the end of the tunnel for the first mole to burrow into the surface of Mars, scientists hope.

Akin to a 16-inch-long pile driver, the self-hammering mole has experienced difficulty getting into the Martian soil since February 2019. It's mostly buried now, thanks to recent efforts to push down on the mole with the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. But whether it will be able to dig deep enough - at least 10 feet - to get an accurate temperature reading of the planet remains to be seen. Images taken by InSight during a Saturday, June 20, hammering session show bits of soil jostling within the scoop - possible evidence that the mole had begun bouncing in place, knocking the bottom of the scoop. While the campaign to save the mole continues, the arm will be used to help carry out other science and engineering work. Here's what you can expect in the months ahead from the mission, which is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. What's next for the mole? The mole is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3, that the German Aerospace Center provided NASA. While the scoop on the end of InSight's arm has blocked the mole from backing out of its pit again, it also blocks the arm's camera from seeing the mole and the pit that has formed around it. Over the next few weeks, the team will move the arm out of the way to better assess how the soil and mole are interacting. After the scoop on the end of NASA's Mars InSight lander was used to push down on the top of the spacecraft's \"mole,\" or self-hammering heat probe, it was held in place to essentially block the mole from popping out of the soil. The movement of sand grains in the scoop, seen here, suggested that the mole had began bumping up against the bottom of the scoop while hammering on June 20, 2020. The mole needs friction from soil in order to burrow. Ironically, loose soil provides that friction as it collapses around the mole. But the soil beneath InSight has proven to be cement-like duricrust, with dirt granules that stick together. As a result, recoil from the mole's self-hammering action causes it to bounce in place. So the team's next moves may be to provide that friction by scraping or chopping nearby soil to move it into the pit it's in. More thoughts about the mole's recent progress can be found on a blog written by HP3's principal investigator, Tilman Spohn of DLR. What's next for InSight's arm? InSight landed on Mars on November 26, 2018. Its robotic arm subsequently set HP3, a seismometer and the seismometer's Wind and Thermal Shield on to the planet's surface. While the arm has been key to helping the mole, scientists and engineers are eager to use the arm's camera to pan over InSight's solar panels, something they haven't done since July 17, 2019. It's the dusty season on Mars, and the panels are likely coated with a fine layer of reddish-brown particles. Estimating how much dust is on the solar panels will let engineers better understand InSight's daily power supply. Scientists also want to resume using the arm to spot meteors streaking across the night sky, as they did earlier in the mission. Doing so could help them predict how often meteors strike this part of the planet. They could also cross-check to see whether data from InSight's seismometer reveals a meteor impact on Mars shortly afterward. What's next for the seismometer? InSight's seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, detected its first marsquake nearly three months after starting its measurements in January 2019. By the fall of 2019, it was detecting a potential quake or two per day. While SEIS has detected more than 480 seismic signals overall, the rate has dropped to less than one per week. This rate change is tied to seasonal variations of atmospheric turbulence, which creates noise that covers up the tiny quake signals. Despite the protective Wind and Thermal Shield, SEIS is sensitive enough that shaking from the wind hitting the shield can make quakes harder to isolate.

The burrowing heat probe onboard NASA's InSight Mars lander, affectionately known as \"the mole,\" was designed to hammer itself at least 10 feet underground. But the going has been tough for the mole since its February 2019 deployment, perhaps as a result of weird soil properties at the landing site. The mole, whose official name is the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, recently got underground once again, thanks to a push from the scoop on the end of InSight's robotic arm. But new photos suggest that the mole might be stuck in its new spot just beneath the surface. The movement of sand grains in the scoop on the end of NASA InSight's robotic arm suggests that the spacecraft's self-hammering \"mole,\" which is in the soil beneath the scoop, had begun tapping the bottom of the scoop while hammering on June 20, 2020.

The InSight team can't fully assess the situation at the moment, because the scoop is blocking the mole from the view of a camera on the lander's arm. InSight's handlers plan to move the scoop out of the way over the next few weeks to get a good look at the mole and its burrow, NASA officials said. Team members also plan to use that camera soon to image InSight's solar panels, something they haven't done since July 2019. It's the dusty season in InSight's locale just north of the Martian equator, and mission engineers want to get a better sense of the lander's power supply. It's too soon to say what mole-aiding steps the team will take next. But one possibility involves moving nearby soil into the mole's pit to give the digger more friction, NASA officials said. The mole needs friction to bury itself deeper, and friction is apparently hard to come by in the cement-like \"duracrust\" beneath InSight's legs. InSight landed on Mars in November 2018 to take an unprecedented look into the planet's deep interior, gathering information that will help scientists better understand the structure, formation and evolution of rocky planets. The mole, which was provided by the German Aerospace Center, is one of two main science instruments onboard the lander. The other is a suite of incredibly sensitive seismometers provided by the French space agency CNES and its partners. The seismometers have already detected more than 480 seismic signals. The detection rate has dropped significantly recently, a change that's likely tied to seasonal variations in atmospheric turbulence. This turbulence creates \"noise\" that swamps the signals of small marsquakes, NASA officials said. The InSight team is also precisely tracking the lander's position on Mars. This work, done via analysis of InSight's communications, reveals how much Mars wobbles as it circles the sun. This information, in turn, will shed light on the size and composition of the Red Planet's core, NASA officials have said.

NASA's InSight lander has used seismic waves bouncing around the interior of the planet to measure the size of its molten core. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has measured more than 500 marsquakes, most of them relatively small. When these quakes occur, the lander measures two types of seismic waves - those that skim near the surface and travel in a relatively straight line between the quake and the lander, and those that bounce around within the planet before reaching the detectors. It records the intensity of the waves in a graph called a seismogram. The InSight team found that many of the records of marsquakes included a set of seismic waves with a shape that suggested they bounced off the boundary between the planet's mantle and its core. These arrived about 500 seconds after the first surface tremors. Using that time difference and the direction from which the waves arrived, the team calculated that Mars's core has a radius of about 1810 to 1860 kilometres, said Simon St\u00e4hler at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, who presented this work on 18 March at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. That size is at the high end of the range of estimates calculated in previous work, which implies that the core may be less dense than we thought, St\u00e4hler said. This may mean that Mars's interior is richer in relatively light elements, such as oxygen, than researchers had realised. \"So far we did not peer into the core itself, but now we know where in the seismogram to look,\" said St\u00e4hler. \"On top of that, we can search for signs of a potential, if unlikely, solid inner core.\" However, all the lander's measurements so far are consistent with the core being entirely molten. The sensitivity of InSight's instruments is limited by atmospheric activity on Mars. This means it can detect more marsquakes at night, when the atmosphere isn't as turbulent, as well as during seasons with fewer dust storms. Dust storm season at the lander's location is nearly over, so the InSight team predicts we will see even more marsquakes in the coming months, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of Mars's underground structure.

But another intrepid NASA spacecraft called Insight has been on the surface of Mars since November of 2018 dissecting our neighboring planet's interior, and now it's relayed back detailed information on the size of Mars' core for the first time - and it's much bigger than anticipated. InSight scientists reported their measurements in a series of presentations last week at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference headquartered in Houston, Texas. Based on Insight's seismographic instruments, which interpret seismic waves bounced between the planet's mantle and core, the radius of the Red Planet's heart was found to be 1,810 to 1,860 kilometres, approximately half the size of Earth's. Per Nature, Simon St\u00e4hler, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, reported these interesting core numbers in a pre-recorded presentation for the March 18th online scientific conference. St\u00e4hler and his team will now deliver their data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. NASA's billion-dollar probe is a stationary lander parked near the Martian equator at the western edge of Elysium Planitia where it listens for and monitors 'marsquakes,' which is an apt nickname for the seismic equivalent of geologic rumblings here on Earth. Since first dropping to the dusty red surface, Insight has recorded nearly 500 temblors, the majority of which were micro-quakes. However, almost 50 'marsquakes' have registered somewhere between magnitude 2 and 4, a shaking intense enough to provide vital feedback about Mars' interior makeup. According to the NASA team's research, the core is far less dense than predicted, and is theorized to be made up of lighter elements like oxygen, blended with a predominance of iron and sulfur.

The German-built Mars mole heat probe could simply never penetrate the hard exterior surface of its landing site in order to make the kind of measurements necessary to give planetary scientists the first real clues as to the makeup of the Martian interior. For nearly two years, the InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport's mole probe has been attempting to burrow into the Martian surface to take the planet's internal temperature, says NASA. But the soil's unexpected tendency to clump deprived the spike-like mole of the friction it needs to hammer itself to a sufficient depth, the team notes. Part of the spacecraft's Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, the mole was intended to be a self-hammering probe that would burrow down to almost 16 feet below Mars' surface. This would have enabled planetary scientists to better understand whether Mars' interior is radically different from Earth or our own Moon. \"We've given it everything we've got, but Mars and our heroic mole remain incompatible,\" HP3's principal investigator, Tilman Spohn of DLR said in a statement. \"Fortunately, we've learned a lot that will benefit future missions that attempt to dig into the subsurface.\" The mole itself is a 16-inch-long spike designed to drag with it a ribbonlike tether that extends from the spacecraft, says NASA. The idea was that Temperature sensors are embedded along the tether to measure the planet's interior heat. But InSight landed in an area with an unusually thick duricrust, or a layer of cemented soil, NASA reports. Rather than being loose and sandlike, as expected, the dirt granules stick together, says the agency. Unfortunately, to work properly, the mole needs friction from the soil in order to travel downward. Without it, says NASA, recoil from its self- hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place. Paradoxically, it's loose soil, not this cement-like duricrust that InSight has encountered at its landing site, that would ideally provide the needed friction as it falls around the mole. The landing site at Elysium Planitia, a broad, equatorial volcanic plain, was selected in part because it has so few visible rocks, implying few large subsurface rocks. Designed to measure heat flowing from the planet once the mole has dug at least 10 feet deep, the mole is strong enough to nudge small rocks out of its way, says NASA. But after repeated attempts to aid the mole in its actions over a two year period using the spacecraft's robotic arm in ways that it was never intended, the team realized that they were in a no-win situation. Meanwhile, the rest of InSight's instruments are functioning and taking data. In fact, NASA says that the mission intends to employ the robotic arm in burying the tether that conveys data and power between the lander and InSight's seismometer, which has recorded more than 480 marsquakes. Burying it will help reduce temperature changes that have created cracking and popping sounds in seismic data, the team notes. The InSight mission itself has been recently extended to late next year. Along with hunting for marsquakes, the lander hosts a radio experiment that is collecting data to reveal whether the planet's core is liquid or solid, says NASA. And InSight's weather sensors are capable of providing some of the most detailed meteorological data ever collected on Mars, says the agency. Together with weather instruments aboard NASA's Curiosity rover and the Perseverance rover, which lands on Feb. 18th, the team says that the three spacecraft will create the first meteorological network on another planet. Could the problem simply be an ordinary rock? \"We don't know for sure, because we can't see underground,\" Spohn said in a statement. \" But there's also the possibility that we've hit a rock.\" ", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2021/01/15/nasa-pulls-plug-on-insight-landers-mars-mole/"}, {"title": "NASA Mars InSight lander limits operations due to dusty solar panels", "date": "2021-02-15", "content": " It's a massive month for spacecraft entering Mars orbit, but let's not forget about the machines that are already on the ground. NASA's solar-powered InSight lander, which touched down in 2018, has a bit of a dust problem to deal with. NASA is temporarily limiting the operation of InSight's science instruments. \"As dust collects on the solar panels and winter comes to Elysium Planitia, the team is following a plan to reduce science operations in order to keep the lander safe,\" the agency said in a statement on Friday. The InSight team tweeted an eye- opening pair of images showing the lander's solar panels near when it first landed and what they look like now. There's a healthy layer of reddish dust coating the array. The lander's broad solar panels are designed to continue working even in the dusty conditions of Mars with the expectation that dust devils will help clean them off. \"But despite InSight detecting hundreds of passing dust devils, none has been close enough to clean off those dinner-table-size panels since they unfurled on Mars in November 2018,\" said NASA. The solar arrays are now down to producing 27% of their full capacity when clean. Some of that power needs to go to InSight's heaters in order to protect the lander during the Martian winter. The available power will be rationed between the heaters and various science instruments. The InSight team expects to ramp science operations back up more fully in mid-2021 as Mars gets closer to the sun. \"Currently, power levels look strong enough to take the lander through the winter,\" said NASA. \"But solar power generation on Mars is always a little uncertain.\" InSight recently received a mission extension through December 2022 that will allow it to continue gathering seismic and weather data.

NASA's InSight lander has used seismic waves bouncing around the interior of the planet to measure the size of its molten core. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has measured more than 500 marsquakes, most of them relatively small. When these quakes occur, the lander measures two types of seismic waves - those that skim near the surface and travel in a relatively straight line between the quake and the lander, and those that bounce around within the planet before reaching the detectors. It records the intensity of the waves in a graph called a seismogram. The InSight team found that many of the records of marsquakes included a set of seismic waves with a shape that suggested they bounced off the boundary between the planet's mantle and its core. These arrived about 500 seconds after the first surface tremors. Using that time difference and the direction from which the waves arrived, the team calculated that Mars's core has a radius of about 1810 to 1860 kilometres, said Simon St\u00e4hler at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, who presented this work on 18 March at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. That size is at the high end of the range of estimates calculated in previous work, which implies that the core may be less dense than we thought, St\u00e4hler said. This may mean that Mars's interior is richer in relatively light elements, such as oxygen, than researchers had realised. \"So far we did not peer into the core itself, but now we know where in the seismogram to look,\" said St\u00e4hler. \"On top of that, we can search for signs of a potential, if unlikely, solid inner core.\" However, all the lander's measurements so far are consistent with the core being entirely molten. The sensitivity of InSight's instruments is limited by atmospheric activity on Mars. This means it can detect more marsquakes at night, when the atmosphere isn't as turbulent, as well as during seasons with fewer dust storms. Dust storm season at the lander's location is nearly over, so the InSight team predicts we will see even more marsquakes in the coming months, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of Mars's underground structure.

But another intrepid NASA spacecraft called Insight has been on the surface of Mars since November of 2018 dissecting our neighboring planet's interior, and now it's relayed back detailed information on the size of Mars' core for the first time - and it's much bigger than anticipated. InSight scientists reported their measurements in a series of presentations last week at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference headquartered in Houston, Texas. Based on Insight's seismographic instruments, which interpret seismic waves bounced between the planet's mantle and core, the radius of the Red Planet's heart was found to be 1,810 to 1,860 kilometres, approximately half the size of Earth's. Per Nature, Simon St\u00e4hler, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, reported these interesting core numbers in a pre-recorded presentation for the March 18th online scientific conference. St\u00e4hler and his team will now deliver their data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. NASA's billion-dollar probe is a stationary lander parked near the Martian equator at the western edge of Elysium Planitia where it listens for and monitors 'marsquakes,' which is an apt nickname for the seismic equivalent of geologic rumblings here on Earth. Since first dropping to the dusty red surface, Insight has recorded nearly 500 temblors, the majority of which were micro-quakes. However, almost 50 'marsquakes' have registered somewhere between magnitude 2 and 4, a shaking intense enough to provide vital feedback about Mars' interior makeup. According to the NASA team's research, the core is far less dense than predicted, and is theorized to be made up of lighter elements like oxygen, blended with a predominance of iron and sulfur. InSight's new measurements will aid scientists understanding of Mars' formation and evolution, and help explain how its dense, metal-rich core divided from the surrounding rocky mantle as the planet cooled.

The robotic geophysicist landed on Mars in November 2018 and, after a few months of preparation, its seismometer began feeling for so-called \" marsquakes.\" The mission identified more than 500 quakes in its first Martian year but lately, heavy winds have prevented the clear signal that scientists need to detect small rumbles in the Red Planet. Now, the weather has turned and in March, mission personnel detected two quakes stronger than magnitude 3.0. \"It's wonderful to once again observe marsquakes after a long period of recording wind noise,\" John Clinton, a seismologist who leads InSight's Marsquake Service at ETH Zurich, said in a statement. \"One Martian year on, we are now much faster at characterizing seismic activity on the Red Planet.\" The two new marsquakes, which InSight detected on March 7 and March 18, both occurred in a region called Cerberus Fossae. That's the same area where the two biggest quakes InSight detected in its first Martian year also took place, suggesting that the area is particularly active, seismically speaking. Scientists are particularly intrigued because the four quakes also appear to match geophysically speaking, according to NASA. \"Over the course of the mission, we've seen two different types of marsquakes: one that is more 'moon-like' and the other, more 'Earth-like,'\" Taichi Kawamura, a seismologist at France's Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, said in the statement. \"Interestingly all four of these larger quakes, which come from Cerberus Fossae, are 'Earth-like.'\" Meanwhile, the lander is also working on a task that scientists hope will sharpen marsquake observations as the mission continues for another Mars year. Mission personnel suspect that the vast temperature changes between day and night on Mars may be creating \"popping sounds and spikes\" in the seismometer's data as the cable connecting the instrument to the main lander expands and contracts. To try to buffer the cable from these changes, the InSight team is using the lander's robotic arm to scoop Martian soil onto the cable. However, NASA warns that it's a tricky time for the lander, which is powered by solar panels. The worst of the planet's harsh _dust-storm season_ is over, but InSight's lily-pad panels are still covered in dust, despite strong winds in the area. At the same time, the Red Planet is drifting away from the sun along its elliptical orbit, reducing power production. And it's winter by the lander, which means that cold temperatures threaten the robot's electronics. Given the conditions, the mission team expects to need to briefly put the lander and its instruments into hibernation mode later this spring to manage those energy shortages. In July, the orbit of Mars will begin to carry it back toward the sun and reduce the strain on InSight's systems.

InSight, which landed in a Martian plain called Elysium Planitia in 2018, has detected more than 500 Mars quakes, felt more than 10,000 dust devils pass by, and started to measure the planet's core. But over the past few months, InSight has been fighting for its life as the red planet's unpredictable weather threatens to snuff out the robot. Unlike other sites where NASA has sent rovers and landers - including the landing spot of the new Perseverance rover and its Mars helicopter - powerful gusts of wind have not been sweeping Elysium Planitia. These winds, called \"cleaning events,\" are needed to blow the red Martian dust off the solar panels of NASA's robots. Without their help, a thick layer of dust has accumulated on InSight, and it's struggling to absorb sunlight. InSight's solar panels were producing just 27 percent of their energy capacity in February, when winter was arriving in Elysium Planitia. So NASA decided to put the lander in \"hibernation mode,\" switching off different instruments each day. Soon the robot will shut down all functions that aren't necessary for its survival. By pausing its scientific operations, the lander should be able to save enough power to keep its systems warm through the frigid Martian nights, when temperatures can drop to negative-130 degrees Fahrenheit. \"The amount of power available over the next few months will really be driven by the weather,\" Chuck Scott, InSight's project manager, said in a statement. Now almost halfway through its expected hibernation period, InSight is still in good condition, but the risk of a potentially fatal power failure is ever- present. If the lander's batteries die, it might never recover. \"We would be hopeful that we'd be able to bring it back back to life, especially if it's not asleep or dead for a long period of time,\" Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator, told Insider. \"But that would be a dicey situation.\" The agency expects to restart InSight's full operations after Mars swings back toward the sun in July. If it can survive this Martian winter, the lander could keep listening for quakes and tracking weather into 2022. InSight's power shortage contributed to NASA's decision to abandon the lander's \"mole\" in January. That burrowing probe was supposed to measure the temperature deep in the Martian crust - crucial data in the study of the planet's history and internal structure. Now scientists are missing out on even more data as the lander shuts down its instruments. Its Mars weather measurements have become scarce, and in the next month or so, it will stop listening for quakes. Banerdt said he fears the lander could miss some big quakes, but it's worth it to keep the robot alive. If InSight's batteries die, he added, \"it's a good zombie spacecraft\" - meaning it's programmed to recharge and start up again once the sun comes out. \"The problem with that scenario is that in the meantime, the spacecraft is very, very cold. And this is happening during the coldest part of the year for the spacecraft,\" Banerdt said. \"A lot of the electronics is pretty delicate. And it's, unfortunately, pretty likely that something would be damaged by the cold.\" Banerdt suspects that's what happened to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. Both ran out of energy on the Martian surface and were unable to power up again. He's hopeful that InSight won't have to die, though. \"Right now, our predictions, our projections are that we should be able to make it through the lowest-power point and come out the other side,\" Banerdt said. Still, an odd dust storm in the next four or five months could tip the scales by piling more dirt onto InSight's solar panels. That's what happened to Opportunity. But luckily, it's not dust-storm season. \"We think we're pretty well off, but Mars is unpredictable. We never know exactly what's going to happen,\" Banerdt said.

But over the past few months, InSight has been fighting for its life as the red planet's unpredictable weather threatens to snuff out the robot. Unlike other sites where NASA has sent rovers and landers - including the landing spot of the new Perseverance rover and its Mars helicopter - powerful gusts of wind have not been sweeping Elysium Planitia. These winds, called \"cleaning events,\" are needed to blow the red Martian dust off the solar panels of NASA's robots. Without their help, a thick layer of dust has accumulated on InSight, and it's struggling to absorb sunlight. InSight's solar panels were producing just 27 percent of their energy capacity in February, when winter was arriving in Elysium Planitia. So NASA decided to put the lander in \"hibernation mode,\" switching off different instruments each day. Soon the robot will shut down all functions that aren't necessary for its survival. By pausing its scientific operations, the lander should be able to save enough power to keep its systems warm through the frigid Martian nights, when temperatures can drop to negative-130 degrees Fahrenheit. \"The amount of power available over the next few months will really be driven by the weather,\" Chuck Scott, InSight's project manager, said in a statement.

If it can survive this Martian winter, the lander could keep listening for quakes and tracking weather into 2022. InSight's power shortage contributed to NASA's decision to abandon the lander's \"mole\" in January. That burrowing probe was supposed to measure the temperature deep in the Martian crust - crucial data in the study of the planet's history and internal structure.

Marsquakes differ from earthquakes in a number of ways, Ceylan explained. To begin with, they are much smaller than earthquakes, with the largest event recorded at teleseismic distances around magnitude 3.6. SEIS is able to detect these small events because the background seismic noise on Mars can be much lower than on Earth, without the constant tremor produced by ocean waves. \"For much of a Martian year, from around sunset until early hours, the Martian atmosphere becomes very quiet, so there is no local noise either,\" he said. \"Additionally, our sensors are optimized and shielded for operating under severe Martian conditions, such as extremely low temperatures and the extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations on the red planet.\" Marsquakes also come in two distinct varieties: low-frequency events with seismic waves propagating at various depths in the planet's mantle, and high- frequency events with waves that appear to propagate through the crust. \"In terms of how the seismic energy decays over time, the low-frequency events appear to be more like earthquakes\" in which the shaking dies away relatively quickly, Ceylan said, \"while the high-frequency events are resembling moonquakes\" in persisting for longer periods. The vast majority of the events are high-frequency and occur at hundreds of kilometers of distance from the lander. \"It is not quite clear to us how these events could be confined to only high frequency energy while they occur at such large distances,\" he said. \"On top of that, the frequency of those events seems to vary over the Martian year, which is a pattern that we do not know at all from Earth.\" Only a handful of marsquakes have clear seismic phase arrivals-the order in which the different types of seismic waves arrive at a location-which allows researchers to calculate the direction and distance the waves come from. All these marsquakes originate from a sunken area of the surface called Cerberus Fossae, about 1800 kilometers away from the InSight Lander. Cerberus Fossae is one of the youngest geological structures on Mars, and may have formed from extensional faulting or subsidence due to dike emplacement. Recent studies suggest extension mechanism may be the source of the Cerberus Fossae quakes, Ceylan noted, \"however, we have a long way in front of us to be able to explain the main tectonic mechanisms behind these quakes.\" The biggest challenge for The Marsquake Service and InSight science team has been \"adapting to unexpected signals in the data from a new planet,\" Ceylan said.

The German-built Mars mole heat probe could simply never penetrate the hard exterior surface of its landing site in order to make the kind of measurements necessary to give planetary scientists the first real clues as to the makeup of the Martian interior. For nearly two years, the InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport's mole probe has been attempting to burrow into the Martian surface to take the planet's internal temperature, says NASA. But the soil's unexpected tendency to clump deprived the spike-like mole of the friction it needs to hammer itself to a sufficient depth, the team notes. Part of the spacecraft's Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, the mole was intended to be a self-hammering probe that would burrow down to almost 16 feet below Mars' surface. This would have enabled planetary scientists to better understand whether Mars' interior is radically different from Earth or our own Moon. \"We've given it everything we've got, but Mars and our heroic mole remain incompatible,\" HP3's principal investigator, Tilman Spohn of DLR said in a statement. \"Fortunately, we've learned a lot that will benefit future missions that attempt to dig into the subsurface.\" The mole itself is a 16-inch-long spike designed to drag with it a ribbonlike tether that extends from the spacecraft, says NASA. The idea was that Temperature sensors are embedded along the tether to measure the planet's interior heat. But InSight landed in an area with an unusually thick duricrust, or a layer of cemented soil, NASA reports. Rather than being loose and sandlike, as expected, the dirt granules stick together, says the agency. Unfortunately, to work properly, the mole needs friction from the soil in order to travel downward. Without it, says NASA, recoil from its self- hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place. Paradoxically, it's loose soil, not this cement-like duricrust that InSight has encountered at its landing site, that would ideally provide the needed friction as it falls around the mole. The landing site at Elysium Planitia, a broad, equatorial volcanic plain, was selected in part because it has so few visible rocks, implying few large subsurface rocks. Designed to measure heat flowing from the planet once the mole has dug at least 10 feet deep, the mole is strong enough to nudge small rocks out of its way, says NASA. But after repeated attempts to aid the mole in its actions over a two year period using the spacecraft's robotic arm in ways that it was never intended, the team realized that they were in a no-win situation. Meanwhile, the rest of InSight's instruments are functioning and taking data. In fact, NASA says that the mission intends to employ the robotic arm in burying the tether that conveys data and power between the lander and InSight's seismometer, which has recorded more than 480 marsquakes. Burying it will help reduce temperature changes that have created cracking and popping sounds in seismic data, the team notes. The InSight mission itself has been recently extended to late next year. Along with hunting for marsquakes, the lander hosts a radio experiment that is collecting data to reveal whether the planet's core is liquid or solid, says NASA. And InSight's weather sensors are capable of providing some of the most detailed meteorological data ever collected on Mars, says the agency. Together with weather instruments aboard NASA's Curiosity rover and the Perseverance rover, which lands on Feb. 18th, the team says that the three spacecraft will create the first meteorological network on another planet. Could the problem simply be an ordinary rock? \"We don't know for sure, because we can't see underground,\" Spohn said in a statement. \" But there's also the possibility that we've hit a rock.\" ", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2021/01/15/nasa-pulls-plug-on-insight-landers-mars-mole/"}, {"title": "NASA Mars InSight lander limits operations due to dusty solar panels", "date": "2021-02-15", "content": " It's a massive month for spacecraft entering Mars orbit, but let's not forget about the machines that are already on the ground. NASA's solar-powered InSight lander, which touched down in 2018, has a bit of a dust problem to deal with. NASA is temporarily limiting the operation of InSight's science instruments. \"As dust collects on the solar panels and winter comes to Elysium Planitia, the team is following a plan to reduce science operations in order to keep the lander safe,\" the agency said in a statement on Friday. The InSight team tweeted an eye- opening pair of images showing the lander's solar panels near when it first landed and what they look like now. There's a healthy layer of reddish dust coating the array. The lander's broad solar panels are designed to continue working even in the dusty conditions of Mars with the expectation that dust devils will help clean them off. \"But despite InSight detecting hundreds of passing dust devils, none has been close enough to clean off those dinner-table-size panels since they unfurled on Mars in November 2018,\" said NASA. The solar arrays are now down to producing 27% of their full capacity when clean. Some of that power needs to go to InSight's heaters in order to protect the lander during the Martian winter. The available power will be rationed between the heaters and various science instruments. The InSight team expects to ramp science operations back up more fully in mid-2021 as Mars gets closer to the sun. \"Currently, power levels look strong enough to take the lander through the winter,\" said NASA. \"But solar power generation on Mars is always a little uncertain.\" InSight recently received a mission extension through December 2022 that will allow it to continue gathering seismic and weather data. Now it just needs to weather the winter.

NASA's InSight lander has used seismic waves bouncing around the interior of the planet to measure the size of its molten core. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has measured more than 500 marsquakes, most of them relatively small. When these quakes occur, the lander measures two types of seismic waves - those that skim near the surface and travel in a relatively straight line between the quake and the lander, and those that bounce around within the planet before reaching the detectors. It records the intensity of the waves in a graph called a seismogram. The InSight team found that many of the records of marsquakes included a set of seismic waves with a shape that suggested they bounced off the boundary between the planet's mantle and its core. These arrived about 500 seconds after the first surface tremors. Using that time difference and the direction from which the waves arrived, the team calculated that Mars's core has a radius of about 1810 to 1860 kilometres, said Simon St\u00e4hler at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, who presented this work on 18 March at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. That size is at the high end of the range of estimates calculated in previous work, which implies that the core may be less dense than we thought, St\u00e4hler said. This may mean that Mars's interior is richer in relatively light elements, such as oxygen, than researchers had realised. \"So far we did not peer into the core itself, but now we know where in the seismogram to look,\" said St\u00e4hler. \"On top of that, we can search for signs of a potential, if unlikely, solid inner core.\" However, all the lander's measurements so far are consistent with the core being entirely molten. The sensitivity of InSight's instruments is limited by atmospheric activity on Mars. This means it can detect more marsquakes at night, when the atmosphere isn't as turbulent, as well as during seasons with fewer dust storms. Dust storm season at the lander's location is nearly over, so the InSight team predicts we will see even more marsquakes in the coming months, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of Mars's underground structure.

But another intrepid NASA spacecraft called Insight has been on the surface of Mars since November of 2018 dissecting our neighboring planet's interior, and now it's relayed back detailed information on the size of Mars' core for the first time - and it's much bigger than anticipated. InSight scientists reported their measurements in a series of presentations last week at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference headquartered in Houston, Texas. Based on Insight's seismographic instruments, which interpret seismic waves bounced between the planet's mantle and core, the radius of the Red Planet's heart was found to be 1,810 to 1,860 kilometres, approximately half the size of Earth's. Per Nature, Simon St\u00e4hler, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, reported these interesting core numbers in a pre-recorded presentation for the March 18th online scientific conference. St\u00e4hler and his team will now deliver their data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. NASA's billion-dollar probe is a stationary lander parked near the Martian equator at the western edge of Elysium Planitia where it listens for and monitors 'marsquakes,' which is an apt nickname for the seismic equivalent of geologic rumblings here on Earth. Since first dropping to the dusty red surface, Insight has recorded nearly 500 temblors, the majority of which were micro-quakes. However, almost 50 'marsquakes' have registered somewhere between magnitude 2 and 4, a shaking intense enough to provide vital feedback about Mars' interior makeup. According to the NASA team's research, the core is far less dense than predicted, and is theorized to be made up of lighter elements like oxygen, blended with a predominance of iron and sulfur. InSight's new measurements will aid scientists understanding of Mars' formation and evolution, and help explain how its dense, metal-rich core divided from the surrounding rocky mantle as the planet cooled. This fiery core is likely to be still molten from Mars' genesis 4.5 billion years ago. Earth and the Moon are the only other rocky planetary bodies that scientists have measured the core of. Now being able to add Mars to that short list will enable researchers to compare and contrast how the Solar System's planets evolved and how Mars lost its magnetic field and atmosphere. The mission's seismic data also predicts that Mars' upper mantle, a region extending from 700 to 800 kilometres below the surface, is infused with a dense zone of thickened material in which deep-traveling seismic energy is found to travel with reduced velocity.

Now, the weather has turned and in March, mission personnel detected two quakes stronger than magnitude 3.0. \"It's wonderful to once again observe marsquakes after a long period of recording wind noise,\" John Clinton, a seismologist who leads InSight's Marsquake Service at ETH Zurich, said in a statement. \"One Martian year on, we are now much faster at characterizing seismic activity on the Red Planet.\" The two new marsquakes, which InSight detected on March 7 and March 18, both occurred in a region called Cerberus Fossae. That's the same area where the two biggest quakes InSight detected in its first Martian year also took place, suggesting that the area is particularly active, seismically speaking. Scientists are particularly intrigued because the four quakes also appear to match geophysically speaking, according to NASA. \"Over the course of the mission, we've seen two different types of marsquakes: one that is more 'moon-like' and the other, more 'Earth-like,'\" Taichi Kawamura, a seismologist at France's Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, said in the statement. \"Interestingly all four of these larger quakes, which come from Cerberus Fossae, are 'Earth-like.'\" Meanwhile, the lander is also working on a task that scientists hope will sharpen marsquake observations as the mission continues for another Mars year. Mission personnel suspect that the vast temperature changes between day and night on Mars may be creating \"popping sounds and spikes\" in the seismometer's data as the cable connecting the instrument to the main lander expands and contracts. To try to buffer the cable from these changes, the InSight team is using the lander's robotic arm to scoop Martian soil onto the cable.

After completing its two-year primary mission, NASA approved a two-year extension pushing the lander's capabilities to the limits. Over more than two years of operation on the surface of the Red Planet, InSight's two circular solar panels have become increasingly covered in Martian dust. To combat this, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have been devising novel solutions to the problem. In May, one of the team's more outlandish solutions proved to be successful. The solution proposed using the lander's robotic digging arm to drop a shovel full of Martian dirt near the lander's solar panels during the windiest time of the day. The wind would then blow the dirt across the surface of the solar panels picking up and clearing the fine dust covering the panels. An attempt of this counterintuitive approach was conducted on May 22, the 884th sol of the mission. Immediately following the operation, NASA observed a 30-watt power boost, a gain of approximately 2%. The team's success could not have come at a better time. Mars is approaching aphelion, its farthest point from the Sun. During this period, noticeably less sunlight will reach the lander's solar panels forcing operators to power down InSight's science instruments to ensure core systems have sufficient power. With the recent bump in power, NASA was able to push out the deadline to power down by \"a few weeks.\" This will enable the team to gain valuable science data that they would otherwise not have been able to.

The steady buildup of dust on the probe's solar arrays has been \"considerable,\" as Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the InSight mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explained during the meeting. With the nearest duster some 222 million miles away, the Martian regolith has been able to accumulate unchecked. Banerdt said 80% of of the lander's array surfaces are now blocked from the Sun, dropping the amount of available daily energy to less than 700 watt-hours, as opposed to the nearly 5,000 watt-hours that were available when InSight landed at Elysium Planitia in November 2018. It's a situation that's only getting worse, and things could come to a grinding halt during the first quarter of 2022, he added. That the InSight mission might soon be over is sad news but not altogether unexpected. The mission was designed to last for a full Martian year, or 687 Earth days, and the steady decline in energy was expected, according to SpaceNews. Earlier this year, NASA extended the mission to December 2022, with an emphasis on the monitoring of seismic activity. During the primary phase of the mission, InSight collected data about the Martian atmosphere and magnetic field, in addition to detecting marsquakes. The lander's Heat Probe and Physical Properties instrument is another story, as the \"mole\" was never able to penetrate deeply into the Martian surface and was ultimately abandoned as a scientific project in January of this year. NASA had hoped for \"cleaning events,\" in which fortuitous gusts of wind might blow some dust off the arrays. They did not. The team tried to shake some dust off by activating motors used to deploy the panels, but that didn't work. They eventually came up with a creative, albeit counterintuitive, solution. InSight's robotic arm was used to sprinkle Martian sand near, but not directly above, the dust-covered panels. The team thought \"it might be possible to strike dust on the panels with sand grains that would 'saltate,' or hop off the solar panel surface and skip through the air in the wind\" and that the \"larger grains might then carry off the smaller dust particles in the wind,\" according to NASA. This was done on May 22, 2021, and worked to a small degree: The technique resulted in a gain of about 30-watt hours of energy per Martian day. At the June 21 meeting, Banerdt said subsequent attempts at saltation offered a slight energy increase and a \"little bit of headroom that we didn't have before,\" as SpaceNews reported. A clever short-term fix, but likely not a long-term solution. Making matters worse, Mars is heading into its aphelion, when the planet will be at its farthest point from the Sun along its orbital path. This will happen two months from now, during which time InSight will have limited access to sunlight. The mission is designed such that the lander can function without its science instruments during this temporary interval. During the aphelion phase, which will last until late October, InSight will reserve power for its heaters, computers, and other critical components, while keeping its seismometer active. At the same time, NASA will refrain from transmitting commands to the stationary lander. Banerdt said there could be \"a month or two of time where we might have to turn off the seismometer, but we're trying to tighten our belts and sharpen our pencils to see whether we can operate straight through.\" Grimly, the situation won't improve much after the aphelion, as Banerdt expects more dust to fall onto the arrays. Eventually, he expects power to fall below survivable levels, an event he predicts for April 2022. Should the lander fail to get a \"significant increase\" in solar array output, \"we're likely to end our mission sometime around that time next year,\" Banerdt said. We've seen this show before. NASA's Opportunity rover stopped transmitting messages on June 10, 2018 and was officially declared dead on February 13, 2019. A global dust storm was blamed for the rover's end. But it's important that we not get too ahead of ourselves here, as InSight has not yet relinquished its mortal coil. This lander, we are hoping, will not go gently into that good Martian night.

To save power and preserve InSight's essential items like heaters in the cold Martian environment, mission managers have already turned off several instruments on the lander. NASA has also tried a new way of encouraging the wind to blow off sand, but with limited success. \"The dust accumulation on the solar arrays has been considerable. We have about 80% obscuration of the arrays,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the InSight mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, according to SpaceNews. Banerdt showed the impact of the declining power levels during a June 21 meeting of NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group. When InSight landed near the Martian equator in November 2018, he said, the robot was generating roughly 5,000 watt-hours of power. Today that level is less than 700 watt-hours. The declining energy levels are not a huge surprise. InSight is in an extended phase of its mission to understand the origin story of the Martian interior and, by extension, that of rocky planets like Earth. A team reviewing the _potential for InSight to extend its mission_ last year warned that the spacecraft's power margins would require new measures to keep going after July 2021. Otherwise, power levels \"are likely to reach critically low levels during the proposed EM extended mission \" that ends in December 2022, compromising potential science return, the panel said at the time. Sometimes a lucky gust of wind from a dust devil can blow accumulated dirt and dust off a spacecraft, as happened during NASA's long-running Spirit and Opportunity Mars rover missions. \"In the case of InSight, the spacecraft's weather sensors have detected many passing whirlwinds, but none have cleared any dust,\" JPL officials said in a statement on June 3. InSight managers have thus been implementing backup plans. They spent more than a year trying to shake off the dust through methods like pulsing the lander's solar array deployment motors but met with little success, JPL officials said. Then, starting on May 22, engineers attempted a new method of budging the dust by using InSight's robotic arm to trickle sand near the panels. If InSight aimed the sand stream just right, some grains were expected to \"saltate,\" or bounce off the solar panel surface, JPL officials said. The bouncing grains skimming off the panels could then carry off some of the smaller dust particles already lying there, using the prevailing Martian winds. \"We had some success with that,\" Banerdt said on June 21 of the various attempts. The first try on May 22 increased energy output by 25 to 30 watt- hours, he said. But the second and third attempts only showed a moderate increase, although he said the three cleanings offered \"a little bit of headroom that we didn't have before.\" Now the managers are trying to triage which, if any, of the science instruments can stay on through aphelion - the farthest Mars gets from the sun during its elliptical orbit, which the planet will reach on July 12. Sensors for weather and magnetic field data are now used sporadically at most. InSight's main instrument, its seismometer suite, has remained operational so far, although Banerdt warned that it may need to be turned off as available light diminishes. \"There may be a month or two of time where we might have to turn off the seismometer, but we're trying to tighten our belts and sharpen our pencils to see whether we can operate straight through,\" Banerdt said. Even after aphelion, he warned, energy levels are expected to fall again by April 2022 due to more dust on the panels and in the atmosphere, along with changes in orbital geometry. \"Unless we get a fairly significant increase in our solar array output, we're likely to end our mission sometime around that time next year,\" Banerdt added, as the mission would fall below its required \"survival energy\" to keep functioning. While relying on solar panels may seem risky in such a dusty environment, doing so lessens the amount of mass at launch, lowering cost and complication for the mission, JPL officials said. Adding dust-removing brushes or fans could add failure points or problems to a long-running mission. Bigger NASA Mars robots such as the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers use nuclear power, making them more flexible in working in severe environments - but also more dependent on dwindling plutonium-238 decay levels over time. Perseverance, which just landed in February, should have enough power to go for 14 years, NASA officials have said. Curiosity is still going strong, nearly nine years after landing on Mars in August 2012. Some members of the public have suggested using the new Mars helicopter Ingenuity to fly near InSight and blow off the dust, JPL officials said. This operation is not only dangerous but impossible, they said, given the sheer distance between the two spacecraft - about 2,145 miles. The next major mission challenge for InSight after aphelion will be around Oct. 7, when Earth and Mars are on opposite sides of the sun. This period of \"solar conjunction\" happens every two years and can interrupt signals between the planets, so NASA stops active communications with its Mars missions for a few weeks as a precaution.

NASA's solar-powered InSight lander, which touched down in 2018, has a bit of a dust problem to deal with. NASA is temporarily limiting the operation of InSight's science instruments. \"As dust collects on the solar panels and winter comes to Elysium Planitia, the team is following a plan to reduce science operations in order to keep the lander safe,\" the agency said in a statement on Friday. The InSight team tweeted an eye- opening pair of images showing the lander's solar panels near when it first landed and what they look like now. There's a healthy layer of reddish dust coating the array. The lander's broad solar panels are designed to continue working even in the dusty conditions of Mars with the expectation that dust devils will help clean them off. \"But despite InSight detecting hundreds of passing dust devils, none has been close enough to clean off those dinner-table-size panels since they unfurled on Mars in November 2018,\" said NASA. The solar arrays are now down to producing 27% of their full capacity when clean. Some of that power needs to go to InSight's heaters in order to protect the lander during the Martian winter. The available power will be rationed between the heaters and various science instruments. The InSight team expects to ramp science operations back up more fully in mid-2021 as Mars gets closer to the sun. \"Currently, power levels look strong enough to take the lander through the winter,\" said NASA. \"But solar power generation on Mars is always a little uncertain.\" InSight recently received a mission extension through December 2022 that will allow it to continue gathering seismic and weather data. Now it just needs to weather the winter.

NASA's InSight lander has used seismic waves bouncing around the interior of the planet to measure the size of its molten core. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has measured more than 500 marsquakes, most of them relatively small. When these quakes occur, the lander measures two types of seismic waves - those that skim near the surface and travel in a relatively straight line between the quake and the lander, and those that bounce around within the planet before reaching the detectors. It records the intensity of the waves in a graph called a seismogram. The InSight team found that many of the records of marsquakes included a set of seismic waves with a shape that suggested they bounced off the boundary between the planet's mantle and its core. These arrived about 500 seconds after the first surface tremors. Using that time difference and the direction from which the waves arrived, the team calculated that Mars's core has a radius of about 1810 to 1860 kilometres, said Simon St\u00e4hler at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, who presented this work on 18 March at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. That size is at the high end of the range of estimates calculated in previous work, which implies that the core may be less dense than we thought, St\u00e4hler said. This may mean that Mars's interior is richer in relatively light elements, such as oxygen, than researchers had realised. \"So far we did not peer into the core itself, but now we know where in the seismogram to look,\" said St\u00e4hler. \"On top of that, we can search for signs of a potential, if unlikely, solid inner core.\" However, all the lander's measurements so far are consistent with the core being entirely molten. The sensitivity of InSight's instruments is limited by atmospheric activity on Mars. This means it can detect more marsquakes at night, when the atmosphere isn't as turbulent, as well as during seasons with fewer dust storms. Dust storm season at the lander's location is nearly over, so the InSight team predicts we will see even more marsquakes in the coming months, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of Mars's underground structure.

But another intrepid NASA spacecraft called Insight has been on the surface of Mars since November of 2018 dissecting our neighboring planet's interior, and now it's relayed back detailed information on the size of Mars' core for the first time - and it's much bigger than anticipated. InSight scientists reported their measurements in a series of presentations last week at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference headquartered in Houston, Texas. Based on Insight's seismographic instruments, which interpret seismic waves bounced between the planet's mantle and core, the radius of the Red Planet's heart was found to be 1,810 to 1,860 kilometres, approximately half the size of Earth's. Per Nature, Simon St\u00e4hler, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, reported these interesting core numbers in a pre-recorded presentation for the March 18th online scientific conference. St\u00e4hler and his team will now deliver their data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. NASA's billion-dollar probe is a stationary lander parked near the Martian equator at the western edge of Elysium Planitia where it listens for and monitors 'marsquakes,' which is an apt nickname for the seismic equivalent of geologic rumblings here on Earth. Since first dropping to the dusty red surface, Insight has recorded nearly 500 temblors, the majority of which were micro-quakes. However, almost 50 'marsquakes' have registered somewhere between magnitude 2 and 4, a shaking intense enough to provide vital feedback about Mars' interior makeup. According to the NASA team's research, the core is far less dense than predicted, and is theorized to be made up of lighter elements like oxygen, blended with a predominance of iron and sulfur. InSight's new measurements will aid scientists understanding of Mars' formation and evolution, and help explain how its dense, metal-rich core divided from the surrounding rocky mantle as the planet cooled. This fiery core is likely to be still molten from Mars' genesis 4.5 billion years ago. Earth and the Moon are the only other rocky planetary bodies that scientists have measured the core of. Now being able to add Mars to that short list will enable researchers to compare and contrast how the Solar System's planets evolved and how Mars lost its magnetic field and atmosphere. The mission's seismic data also predicts that Mars' upper mantle, a region extending from 700 to 800 kilometres below the surface, is infused with a dense zone of thickened material in which deep-traveling seismic energy is found to travel with reduced velocity.

The robotic geophysicist landed on Mars in November 2018 and, after a few months of preparation, its seismometer began feeling for so-called \" marsquakes.\" The mission identified more than 500 quakes in its first Martian year but lately, heavy winds have prevented the clear signal that scientists need to detect small rumbles in the Red Planet. Now, the weather has turned and in March, mission personnel detected two quakes stronger than magnitude 3.0. \"It's wonderful to once again observe marsquakes after a long period of recording wind noise,\" John Clinton, a seismologist who leads InSight's Marsquake Service at ETH Zurich, said in a statement. \"One Martian year on, we are now much faster at characterizing seismic activity on the Red Planet.\" The two new marsquakes, which InSight detected on March 7 and March 18, both occurred in a region called Cerberus Fossae. That's the same area where the two biggest quakes InSight detected in its first Martian year also took place, suggesting that the area is particularly active, seismically speaking. Scientists are particularly intrigued because the four quakes also appear to match geophysically speaking, according to NASA. \"Over the course of the mission, we've seen two different types of marsquakes: one that is more 'moon-like' and the other, more 'Earth-like,'\" Taichi Kawamura, a seismologist at France's Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, said in the statement. \"Interestingly all four of these larger quakes, which come from Cerberus Fossae, are 'Earth-like.'\" Meanwhile, the lander is also working on a task that scientists hope will sharpen marsquake observations as the mission continues for another Mars year. Mission personnel suspect that the vast temperature changes between day and night on Mars may be creating \"popping sounds and spikes\" in the seismometer's data as the cable connecting the instrument to the main lander expands and contracts. To try to buffer the cable from these changes, the InSight team is using the lander's robotic arm to scoop Martian soil onto the cable. However, NASA warns that it's a tricky time for the lander, which is powered by solar panels. The worst of the planet's harsh _dust-storm season_ is over, but InSight's lily-pad panels are still covered in dust, despite strong winds in the area. At the same time, the Red Planet is drifting away from the sun along its elliptical orbit, reducing power production. And it's winter by the lander, which means that cold temperatures threaten the robot's electronics. Given the conditions, the mission team expects to need to briefly put the lander and its instruments into hibernation mode later this spring to manage those energy shortages. In July, the orbit of Mars will begin to carry it back toward the sun and reduce the strain on InSight's systems.

InSight, which landed in a Martian plain called Elysium Planitia in 2018, has detected more than 500 Mars quakes, felt more than 10,000 dust devils pass by, and started to measure the planet's core. But over the past few months, InSight has been fighting for its life as the red planet's unpredictable weather threatens to snuff out the robot. Unlike other sites where NASA has sent rovers and landers - including the landing spot of the new Perseverance rover and its Mars helicopter - powerful gusts of wind have not been sweeping Elysium Planitia. These winds, called \"cleaning events,\" are needed to blow the red Martian dust off the solar panels of NASA's robots. Without their help, a thick layer of dust has accumulated on InSight, and it's struggling to absorb sunlight. InSight's solar panels were producing just 27 percent of their energy capacity in February, when winter was arriving in Elysium Planitia. So NASA decided to put the lander in \"hibernation mode,\" switching off different instruments each day. Soon the robot will shut down all functions that aren't necessary for its survival. By pausing its scientific operations, the lander should be able to save enough power to keep its systems warm through the frigid Martian nights, when temperatures can drop to negative-130 degrees Fahrenheit. \"The amount of power available over the next few months will really be driven by the weather,\" Chuck Scott, InSight's project manager, said in a statement. Now almost halfway through its expected hibernation period, InSight is still in good condition, but the risk of a potentially fatal power failure is ever- present. If the lander's batteries die, it might never recover. \"We would be hopeful that we'd be able to bring it back back to life, especially if it's not asleep or dead for a long period of time,\" Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator, told Insider. \"But that would be a dicey situation.\" The agency expects to restart InSight's full operations after Mars swings back toward the sun in July. If it can survive this Martian winter, the lander could keep listening for quakes and tracking weather into 2022. InSight's power shortage contributed to NASA's decision to abandon the lander's \"mole\" in January. That burrowing probe was supposed to measure the temperature deep in the Martian crust - crucial data in the study of the planet's history and internal structure. Now scientists are missing out on even more data as the lander shuts down its instruments. Its Mars weather measurements have become scarce, and in the next month or so, it will stop listening for quakes. Banerdt said he fears the lander could miss some big quakes, but it's worth it to keep the robot alive. If InSight's batteries die, he added, \"it's a good zombie spacecraft\" - meaning it's programmed to recharge and start up again once the sun comes out. \"The problem with that scenario is that in the meantime, the spacecraft is very, very cold. And this is happening during the coldest part of the year for the spacecraft,\" Banerdt said. \"A lot of the electronics is pretty delicate. And it's, unfortunately, pretty likely that something would be damaged by the cold.\" Banerdt suspects that's what happened to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. Both ran out of energy on the Martian surface and were unable to power up again. He's hopeful that InSight won't have to die, though. \"Right now, our predictions, our projections are that we should be able to make it through the lowest-power point and come out the other side,\" Banerdt said. Still, an odd dust storm in the next four or five months could tip the scales by piling more dirt onto InSight's solar panels. That's what happened to Opportunity. But luckily, it's not dust-storm season. \"We think we're pretty well off, but Mars is unpredictable. We never know exactly what's going to happen,\" Banerdt said.

At the Seismological Society of America 's 2021 Annual Meeting, Savas Ceylan of ETH Z\u00fcrich discussed some of the findings from The Marsquake Service, the part of the InSight ground team that detects marsquakes and curates the planet's seismicity catalog. Marsquakes differ from earthquakes in a number of ways, Ceylan explained. To begin with, they are much smaller than earthquakes, with the largest event recorded at teleseismic distances around magnitude 3.6. SEIS is able to detect these small events because the background seismic noise on Mars can be much lower than on Earth, without the constant tremor produced by ocean waves. \"For much of a Martian year, from around sunset until early hours, the Martian atmosphere becomes very quiet, so there is no local noise either,\" he said. \"Additionally, our sensors are optimized and shielded for operating under severe Martian conditions, such as extremely low temperatures and the extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations on the red planet.\" Marsquakes also come in two distinct varieties: low-frequency events with seismic waves propagating at various depths in the planet's mantle, and high- frequency events with waves that appear to propagate through the crust. \"In terms of how the seismic energy decays over time, the low-frequency events appear to be more like earthquakes\" in which the shaking dies away relatively quickly, Ceylan said, \"while the high-frequency events are resembling moonquakes\" in persisting for longer periods. The vast majority of the events are high-frequency and occur at hundreds of kilometers of distance from the lander. \"It is not quite clear to us how these events could be confined to only high frequency energy while they occur at such large distances,\" he said. \"On top of that, the frequency of those events seems to vary over the Martian year, which is a pattern that we do not know at all from Earth.\" Only a handful of marsquakes have clear seismic phase arrivals-the order in which the different types of seismic waves arrive at a location-which allows researchers to calculate the direction and distance the waves come from. All these marsquakes originate from a sunken area of the surface called Cerberus Fossae, about 1800 kilometers away from the InSight Lander. Cerberus Fossae is one of the youngest geological structures on Mars, and may have formed from extensional faulting or subsidence due to dike emplacement. Recent studies suggest extension mechanism may be the source of the Cerberus Fossae quakes, Ceylan noted, \"however, we have a long way in front of us to be able to explain the main tectonic mechanisms behind these quakes.\" The biggest challenge for The Marsquake Service and InSight science team has been \"adapting to unexpected signals in the data from a new planet,\" Ceylan said. Although there were significant efforts to shield SEIS from non-seismic noise by covering it and placing it directly on the Martian surface, its data are still contaminated by weather and lander noise. \"We needed to understand the noise on Mars from scratch, discover how our seismometers behave, how the atmosphere of Mars affects seismic recordings, and find alternative methods to interpret the data properly,\" said Ceylan. It took the Service a while to be \"confident in identifying the different event types,\" he added, \"discriminating these weak signals from the rich and varied background noise, and being able to characterize these novel signals in a systematic manner to provide a self-consistent catalog.\" The InSight seismicity catalog and data are released to the public via IPG Paris, IRIS, and PDS on a three month schedule, with three month data delay.

InSight, which recently had its two-year mission to study the interior geology of Mars extended, has been suffering from a buildup of dust on its solar panels. This dust is only adding on to the expected power loss which occurs as the red planet approaches aphelion - the maximum distance from the Sun in its orbit. Attempts to shake the panels clear by pulsing their deployment motors were unsuccessful. Other solar-powered missions have experienced a cleaning effect from the Martian winds; however, despite seeing plenty of gusts, InSight has not seen any significant improvement. Counterintuitively, operators instructed the lander to slowly trickle more dust and sand from its scoop close to one of the solar panels. As the wind blew, larger particles were carried by the breeze across the panels and bounced off the surface, carrying away some accumulated dust. While that may sound like a minuscule effect, the experiment resulted in about 30 extra watt-hours per Sol. Margins are still thin, and science instruments will still need to be disabled to conserve power. But this boost alone was enough to delay the powerdown for a few weeks.

An attempt of this counterintuitive approach was conducted on May 22, the 884th sol of the mission. Immediately following the operation, NASA observed a 30-watt power boost, a gain of approximately 2%. The team's success could not have come at a better time. Mars is approaching aphelion, its farthest point from the Sun. During this period, noticeably less sunlight will reach the lander's solar panels forcing operators to power down InSight's science instruments to ensure core systems have sufficient power. With the recent bump in power, NASA was able to push out the deadline to power down by \"a few weeks.\" This will enable the team to gain valuable science data that they would otherwise not have been able to.

The steady buildup of dust on the probe's solar arrays has been \"considerable,\" as Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the InSight mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explained during the meeting. With the nearest duster some 222 million miles away, the Martian regolith has been able to accumulate unchecked. Banerdt said 80% of of the lander's array surfaces are now blocked from the Sun, dropping the amount of available daily energy to less than 700 watt-hours, as opposed to the nearly 5,000 watt-hours that were available when InSight landed at Elysium Planitia in November 2018. It's a situation that's only getting worse, and things could come to a grinding halt during the first quarter of 2022, he added. That the InSight mission might soon be over is sad news but not altogether unexpected. The mission was designed to last for a full Martian year, or 687 Earth days, and the steady decline in energy was expected, according to SpaceNews. Earlier this year, NASA extended the mission to December 2022, with an emphasis on the monitoring of seismic activity. During the primary phase of the mission, InSight collected data about the Martian atmosphere and magnetic field, in addition to detecting marsquakes. The lander's Heat Probe and Physical Properties instrument is another story, as the \"mole\" was never able to penetrate deeply into the Martian surface and was ultimately abandoned as a scientific project in January of this year. NASA had hoped for \"cleaning events,\" in which fortuitous gusts of wind might blow some dust off the arrays. They did not. The team tried to shake some dust off by activating motors used to deploy the panels, but that didn't work. They eventually came up with a creative, albeit counterintuitive, solution. InSight's robotic arm was used to sprinkle Martian sand near, but not directly above, the dust-covered panels. The team thought \"it might be possible to strike dust on the panels with sand grains that would 'saltate,' or hop off the solar panel surface and skip through the air in the wind\" and that the \"larger grains might then carry off the smaller dust particles in the wind,\" according to NASA. This was done on May 22, 2021, and worked to a small degree: The technique resulted in a gain of about 30-watt hours of energy per Martian day. At the June 21 meeting, Banerdt said subsequent attempts at saltation offered a slight energy increase and a \"little bit of headroom that we didn't have before,\" as SpaceNews reported. A clever short-term fix, but likely not a long-term solution. Making matters worse, Mars is heading into its aphelion, when the planet will be at its farthest point from the Sun along its orbital path. This will happen two months from now, during which time InSight will have limited access to sunlight. The mission is designed such that the lander can function without its science instruments during this temporary interval. During the aphelion phase, which will last until late October, InSight will reserve power for its heaters, computers, and other critical components, while keeping its seismometer active. At the same time, NASA will refrain from transmitting commands to the stationary lander. Banerdt said there could be \"a month or two of time where we might have to turn off the seismometer, but we're trying to tighten our belts and sharpen our pencils to see whether we can operate straight through.\" Grimly, the situation won't improve much after the aphelion, as Banerdt expects more dust to fall onto the arrays. Eventually, he expects power to fall below survivable levels, an event he predicts for April 2022. Should the lander fail to get a \"significant increase\" in solar array output, \"we're likely to end our mission sometime around that time next year,\" Banerdt said. We've seen this show before. NASA's Opportunity rover stopped transmitting messages on June 10, 2018 and was officially declared dead on February 13, 2019. A global dust storm was blamed for the rover's end. But it's important that we not get too ahead of ourselves here, as InSight has not yet relinquished its mortal coil. This lander, we are hoping, will not go gently into that good Martian night.

To save power and preserve InSight's essential items like heaters in the cold Martian environment, mission managers have already turned off several instruments on the lander. NASA has also tried a new way of encouraging the wind to blow off sand, but with limited success. \"The dust accumulation on the solar arrays has been considerable. We have about 80% obscuration of the arrays,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the InSight mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, according to SpaceNews. Banerdt showed the impact of the declining power levels during a June 21 meeting of NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group. When InSight landed near the Martian equator in November 2018, he said, the robot was generating roughly 5,000 watt-hours of power. Today that level is less than 700 watt-hours. The declining energy levels are not a huge surprise. InSight is in an extended phase of its mission to understand the origin story of the Martian interior and, by extension, that of rocky planets like Earth. A team reviewing the _potential for InSight to extend its mission_ last year warned that the spacecraft's power margins would require new measures to keep going after July 2021. Otherwise, power levels \"are likely to reach critically low levels during the proposed EM extended mission \" that ends in December 2022, compromising potential science return, the panel said at the time. Sometimes a lucky gust of wind from a dust devil can blow accumulated dirt and dust off a spacecraft, as happened during NASA's long-running Spirit and Opportunity Mars rover missions. \"In the case of InSight, the spacecraft's weather sensors have detected many passing whirlwinds, but none have cleared any dust,\" JPL officials said in a statement on June 3. InSight managers have thus been implementing backup plans. They spent more than a year trying to shake off the dust through methods like pulsing the lander's solar array deployment motors but met with little success, JPL officials said. Then, starting on May 22, engineers attempted a new method of budging the dust by using InSight's robotic arm to trickle sand near the panels. If InSight aimed the sand stream just right, some grains were expected to \"saltate,\" or bounce off the solar panel surface, JPL officials said. The bouncing grains skimming off the panels could then carry off some of the smaller dust particles already lying there, using the prevailing Martian winds. \"We had some success with that,\" Banerdt said on June 21 of the various attempts. The first try on May 22 increased energy output by 25 to 30 watt- hours, he said. But the second and third attempts only showed a moderate increase, although he said the three cleanings offered \"a little bit of headroom that we didn't have before.\" Now the managers are trying to triage which, if any, of the science instruments can stay on through aphelion - the farthest Mars gets from the sun during its elliptical orbit, which the planet will reach on July 12. Sensors for weather and magnetic field data are now used sporadically at most. InSight's main instrument, its seismometer suite, has remained operational so far, although Banerdt warned that it may need to be turned off as available light diminishes. \"There may be a month or two of time where we might have to turn off the seismometer, but we're trying to tighten our belts and sharpen our pencils to see whether we can operate straight through,\" Banerdt said. Even after aphelion, he warned, energy levels are expected to fall again by April 2022 due to more dust on the panels and in the atmosphere, along with changes in orbital geometry. \"Unless we get a fairly significant increase in our solar array output, we're likely to end our mission sometime around that time next year,\" Banerdt added, as the mission would fall below its required \"survival energy\" to keep functioning. While relying on solar panels may seem risky in such a dusty environment, doing so lessens the amount of mass at launch, lowering cost and complication for the mission, JPL officials said. Adding dust-removing brushes or fans could add failure points or problems to a long-running mission. Bigger NASA Mars robots such as the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers use nuclear power, making them more flexible in working in severe environments - but also more dependent on dwindling plutonium-238 decay levels over time. Perseverance, which just landed in February, should have enough power to go for 14 years, NASA officials have said. Curiosity is still going strong, nearly nine years after landing on Mars in August 2012. Some members of the public have suggested using the new Mars helicopter Ingenuity to fly near InSight and blow off the dust, JPL officials said. This operation is not only dangerous but impossible, they said, given the sheer distance between the two spacecraft - about 2,145 miles. The next major mission challenge for InSight after aphelion will be around Oct. 7, when Earth and Mars are on opposite sides of the sun. This period of \"solar conjunction\" happens every two years and can interrupt signals between the planets, so NASA stops active communications with its Mars missions for a few weeks as a precaution.

NASA's InSight lander has used seismic waves bouncing around the interior of the planet to measure the size of its molten core. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has measured more than 500 marsquakes, most of them relatively small. When these quakes occur, the lander measures two types of seismic waves - those that skim near the surface and travel in a relatively straight line between the quake and the lander, and those that bounce around within the planet before reaching the detectors. It records the intensity of the waves in a graph called a seismogram. The InSight team found that many of the records of marsquakes included a set of seismic waves with a shape that suggested they bounced off the boundary between the planet's mantle and its core. These arrived about 500 seconds after the first surface tremors. Using that time difference and the direction from which the waves arrived, the team calculated that Mars's core has a radius of about 1810 to 1860 kilometres, said Simon St\u00e4hler at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, who presented this work on 18 March at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. That size is at the high end of the range of estimates calculated in previous work, which implies that the core may be less dense than we thought, St\u00e4hler said. This may mean that Mars's interior is richer in relatively light elements, such as oxygen, than researchers had realised. \"So far we did not peer into the core itself, but now we know where in the seismogram to look,\" said St\u00e4hler. \"On top of that, we can search for signs of a potential, if unlikely, solid inner core.\" However, all the lander's measurements so far are consistent with the core being entirely molten. The sensitivity of InSight's instruments is limited by atmospheric activity on Mars. This means it can detect more marsquakes at night, when the atmosphere isn't as turbulent, as well as during seasons with fewer dust storms. Dust storm season at the lander's location is nearly over, so the InSight team predicts we will see even more marsquakes in the coming months, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of Mars's underground structure.

But another intrepid NASA spacecraft called Insight has been on the surface of Mars since November of 2018 dissecting our neighboring planet's interior, and now it's relayed back detailed information on the size of Mars' core for the first time - and it's much bigger than anticipated. InSight scientists reported their measurements in a series of presentations last week at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference headquartered in Houston, Texas. Based on Insight's seismographic instruments, which interpret seismic waves bounced between the planet's mantle and core, the radius of the Red Planet's heart was found to be 1,810 to 1,860 kilometres, approximately half the size of Earth's. Per Nature, Simon St\u00e4hler, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, reported these interesting core numbers in a pre-recorded presentation for the March 18th online scientific conference. St\u00e4hler and his team will now deliver their data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. NASA's billion-dollar probe is a stationary lander parked near the Martian equator at the western edge of Elysium Planitia where it listens for and monitors 'marsquakes,' which is an apt nickname for the seismic equivalent of geologic rumblings here on Earth. Since first dropping to the dusty red surface, Insight has recorded nearly 500 temblors, the majority of which were micro-quakes. However, almost 50 'marsquakes' have registered somewhere between magnitude 2 and 4, a shaking intense enough to provide vital feedback about Mars' interior makeup. According to the NASA team's research, the core is far less dense than predicted, and is theorized to be made up of lighter elements like oxygen, blended with a predominance of iron and sulfur. InSight's new measurements will aid scientists understanding of Mars' formation and evolution, and help explain how its dense, metal-rich core divided from the surrounding rocky mantle as the planet cooled. This fiery core is likely to be still molten from Mars' genesis 4.5 billion years ago. Earth and the Moon are the only other rocky planetary bodies that scientists have measured the core of. Now being able to add Mars to that short list will enable researchers to compare and contrast how the Solar System's planets evolved and how Mars lost its magnetic field and atmosphere. The mission's seismic data also predicts that Mars' upper mantle, a region extending from 700 to 800 kilometres below the surface, is infused with a dense zone of thickened material in which deep-traveling seismic energy is found to travel with reduced velocity.

The robotic geophysicist landed on Mars in November 2018 and, after a few months of preparation, its seismometer began feeling for so-called \" marsquakes.\" The mission identified more than 500 quakes in its first Martian year but lately, heavy winds have prevented the clear signal that scientists need to detect small rumbles in the Red Planet. Now, the weather has turned and in March, mission personnel detected two quakes stronger than magnitude 3.0. \"It's wonderful to once again observe marsquakes after a long period of recording wind noise,\" John Clinton, a seismologist who leads InSight's Marsquake Service at ETH Zurich, said in a statement. \"One Martian year on, we are now much faster at characterizing seismic activity on the Red Planet.\" The two new marsquakes, which InSight detected on March 7 and March 18, both occurred in a region called Cerberus Fossae. That's the same area where the two biggest quakes InSight detected in its first Martian year also took place, suggesting that the area is particularly active, seismically speaking. Scientists are particularly intrigued because the four quakes also appear to match geophysically speaking, according to NASA. \"Over the course of the mission, we've seen two different types of marsquakes: one that is more 'moon-like' and the other, more 'Earth-like,'\" Taichi Kawamura, a seismologist at France's Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, said in the statement. \"Interestingly all four of these larger quakes, which come from Cerberus Fossae, are 'Earth-like.'\" Meanwhile, the lander is also working on a task that scientists hope will sharpen marsquake observations as the mission continues for another Mars year. Mission personnel suspect that the vast temperature changes between day and night on Mars may be creating \"popping sounds and spikes\" in the seismometer's data as the cable connecting the instrument to the main lander expands and contracts. To try to buffer the cable from these changes, the InSight team is using the lander's robotic arm to scoop Martian soil onto the cable. However, NASA warns that it's a tricky time for the lander, which is powered by solar panels. The worst of the planet's harsh _dust-storm season_ is over, but InSight's lily-pad panels are still covered in dust, despite strong winds in the area. At the same time, the Red Planet is drifting away from the sun along its elliptical orbit, reducing power production. And it's winter by the lander, which means that cold temperatures threaten the robot's electronics. Given the conditions, the mission team expects to need to briefly put the lander and its instruments into hibernation mode later this spring to manage those energy shortages. In July, the orbit of Mars will begin to carry it back toward the sun and reduce the strain on InSight's systems.

InSight, which landed in a Martian plain called Elysium Planitia in 2018, has detected more than 500 Mars quakes, felt more than 10,000 dust devils pass by, and started to measure the planet's core. But over the past few months, InSight has been fighting for its life as the red planet's unpredictable weather threatens to snuff out the robot. Unlike other sites where NASA has sent rovers and landers - including the landing spot of the new Perseverance rover and its Mars helicopter - powerful gusts of wind have not been sweeping Elysium Planitia. These winds, called \"cleaning events,\" are needed to blow the red Martian dust off the solar panels of NASA's robots. Without their help, a thick layer of dust has accumulated on InSight, and it's struggling to absorb sunlight. InSight's solar panels were producing just 27 percent of their energy capacity in February, when winter was arriving in Elysium Planitia. So NASA decided to put the lander in \"hibernation mode,\" switching off different instruments each day. Soon the robot will shut down all functions that aren't necessary for its survival. By pausing its scientific operations, the lander should be able to save enough power to keep its systems warm through the frigid Martian nights, when temperatures can drop to negative-130 degrees Fahrenheit. \"The amount of power available over the next few months will really be driven by the weather,\" Chuck Scott, InSight's project manager, said in a statement. Now almost halfway through its expected hibernation period, InSight is still in good condition, but the risk of a potentially fatal power failure is ever- present. If the lander's batteries die, it might never recover. \"We would be hopeful that we'd be able to bring it back back to life, especially if it's not asleep or dead for a long period of time,\" Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator, told Insider. \"But that would be a dicey situation.\" The agency expects to restart InSight's full operations after Mars swings back toward the sun in July. If it can survive this Martian winter, the lander could keep listening for quakes and tracking weather into 2022. InSight's power shortage contributed to NASA's decision to abandon the lander's \"mole\" in January. That burrowing probe was supposed to measure the temperature deep in the Martian crust - crucial data in the study of the planet's history and internal structure. Now scientists are missing out on even more data as the lander shuts down its instruments. Its Mars weather measurements have become scarce, and in the next month or so, it will stop listening for quakes. Banerdt said he fears the lander could miss some big quakes, but it's worth it to keep the robot alive. If InSight's batteries die, he added, \"it's a good zombie spacecraft\" - meaning it's programmed to recharge and start up again once the sun comes out. \"The problem with that scenario is that in the meantime, the spacecraft is very, very cold. And this is happening during the coldest part of the year for the spacecraft,\" Banerdt said. \"A lot of the electronics is pretty delicate. And it's, unfortunately, pretty likely that something would be damaged by the cold.\" Banerdt suspects that's what happened to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. Both ran out of energy on the Martian surface and were unable to power up again. He's hopeful that InSight won't have to die, though. \"Right now, our predictions, our projections are that we should be able to make it through the lowest-power point and come out the other side,\" Banerdt said. Still, an odd dust storm in the next four or five months could tip the scales by piling more dirt onto InSight's solar panels. That's what happened to Opportunity. But luckily, it's not dust-storm season. \"We think we're pretty well off, but Mars is unpredictable. We never know exactly what's going to happen,\" Banerdt said.

At the Seismological Society of America 's 2021 Annual Meeting, Savas Ceylan of ETH Z\u00fcrich discussed some of the findings from The Marsquake Service, the part of the InSight ground team that detects marsquakes and curates the planet's seismicity catalog. Marsquakes differ from earthquakes in a number of ways, Ceylan explained. To begin with, they are much smaller than earthquakes, with the largest event recorded at teleseismic distances around magnitude 3.6. SEIS is able to detect these small events because the background seismic noise on Mars can be much lower than on Earth, without the constant tremor produced by ocean waves. \"For much of a Martian year, from around sunset until early hours, the Martian atmosphere becomes very quiet, so there is no local noise either,\" he said. \"Additionally, our sensors are optimized and shielded for operating under severe Martian conditions, such as extremely low temperatures and the extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations on the red planet.\" Marsquakes also come in two distinct varieties: low-frequency events with seismic waves propagating at various depths in the planet's mantle, and high- frequency events with waves that appear to propagate through the crust. \"In terms of how the seismic energy decays over time, the low-frequency events appear to be more like earthquakes\" in which the shaking dies away relatively quickly, Ceylan said, \"while the high-frequency events are resembling moonquakes\" in persisting for longer periods. The vast majority of the events are high-frequency and occur at hundreds of kilometers of distance from the lander. \"It is not quite clear to us how these events could be confined to only high frequency energy while they occur at such large distances,\" he said. \"On top of that, the frequency of those events seems to vary over the Martian year, which is a pattern that we do not know at all from Earth.\" Only a handful of marsquakes have clear seismic phase arrivals-the order in which the different types of seismic waves arrive at a location-which allows researchers to calculate the direction and distance the waves come from. All these marsquakes originate from a sunken area of the surface called Cerberus Fossae, about 1800 kilometers away from the InSight Lander. Cerberus Fossae is one of the youngest geological structures on Mars, and may have formed from extensional faulting or subsidence due to dike emplacement. Recent studies suggest extension mechanism may be the source of the Cerberus Fossae quakes, Ceylan noted, \"however, we have a long way in front of us to be able to explain the main tectonic mechanisms behind these quakes.\" The biggest challenge for The Marsquake Service and InSight science team has been \"adapting to unexpected signals in the data from a new planet,\" Ceylan said. Although there were significant efforts to shield SEIS from non-seismic noise by covering it and placing it directly on the Martian surface, its data are still contaminated by weather and lander noise. \"We needed to understand the noise on Mars from scratch, discover how our seismometers behave, how the atmosphere of Mars affects seismic recordings, and find alternative methods to interpret the data properly,\" said Ceylan. It took the Service a while to be \"confident in identifying the different event types,\" he added, \"discriminating these weak signals from the rich and varied background noise, and being able to characterize these novel signals in a systematic manner to provide a self-consistent catalog.\" The InSight seismicity catalog and data are released to the public via IPG Paris, IRIS, and PDS on a three month schedule, with three month data delay.

InSight, which recently had its two-year mission to study the interior geology of Mars extended, has been suffering from a buildup of dust on its solar panels. This dust is only adding on to the expected power loss which occurs as the red planet approaches aphelion - the maximum distance from the Sun in its orbit. Attempts to shake the panels clear by pulsing their deployment motors were unsuccessful. Other solar-powered missions have experienced a cleaning effect from the Martian winds; however, despite seeing plenty of gusts, InSight has not seen any significant improvement. Counterintuitively, operators instructed the lander to slowly trickle more dust and sand from its scoop close to one of the solar panels. As the wind blew, larger particles were carried by the breeze across the panels and bounced off the surface, carrying away some accumulated dust. While that may sound like a minuscule effect, the experiment resulted in about 30 extra watt-hours per Sol. Margins are still thin, and science instruments will still need to be disabled to conserve power. But this boost alone was enough to delay the powerdown for a few weeks.

NASA's InSight lander touched down on the surface of Mars on November 26, 2018, with a mission to study the planet's seismic activity. After completing its two-year primary mission, NASA approved a two-year extension pushing the lander's capabilities to the limits. Over more than two years of operation on the surface of the Red Planet, InSight's two circular solar panels have become increasingly covered in Martian dust. To combat this, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have been devising novel solutions to the problem. In May, one of the team's more outlandish solutions proved to be successful. The solution proposed using the lander's robotic digging arm to drop a shovel full of Martian dirt near the lander's solar panels during the windiest time of the day.

With the nearest duster some 222 million miles away, the Martian regolith has been able to accumulate unchecked. Banerdt said 80% of of the lander's array surfaces are now blocked from the Sun, dropping the amount of available daily energy to less than 700 watt-hours, as opposed to the nearly 5,000 watt-hours that were available when InSight landed at Elysium Planitia in November 2018. It's a situation that's only getting worse, and things could come to a grinding halt during the first quarter of 2022, he added. That the InSight mission might soon be over is sad news but not altogether unexpected. The mission was designed to last for a full Martian year, or 687 Earth days, and the steady decline in energy was expected, according to SpaceNews. Earlier this year, NASA extended the mission to December 2022, with an emphasis on the monitoring of seismic activity. During the primary phase of the mission, InSight collected data about the Martian atmosphere and magnetic field, in addition to detecting marsquakes.

A clever short-term fix, but likely not a long-term solution. Making matters worse, Mars is heading into its aphelion, when the planet will be at its farthest point from the Sun along its orbital path. This will happen two months from now, during which time InSight will have limited access to sunlight. The mission is designed such that the lander can function without its science instruments during this temporary interval. During the aphelion phase, which will last until late October, InSight will reserve power for its heaters, computers, and other critical components, while keeping its seismometer active. At the same time, NASA will refrain from transmitting commands to the stationary lander.

InSight's main instrument, its seismometer suite, has remained operational so far, although Banerdt warned that it may need to be turned off as available light diminishes. \"There may be a month or two of time where we might have to turn off the seismometer, but we're trying to tighten our belts and sharpen our pencils to see whether we can operate straight through,\" Banerdt said.

The robotic geophysicist landed on Mars in November 2018 and, after a few months of preparation, its seismometer began feeling for so-called \" marsquakes.\" The mission identified more than 500 quakes in its first Martian year but lately, heavy winds have prevented the clear signal that scientists need to detect small rumbles in the Red Planet. Now, the weather has turned and in March, mission personnel detected two quakes stronger than magnitude 3.0. \"It's wonderful to once again observe marsquakes after a long period of recording wind noise,\" John Clinton, a seismologist who leads InSight's Marsquake Service at ETH Zurich, said in a statement. \"One Martian year on, we are now much faster at characterizing seismic activity on the Red Planet.\" The two new marsquakes, which InSight detected on March 7 and March 18, both occurred in a region called Cerberus Fossae. That's the same area where the two biggest quakes InSight detected in its first Martian year also took place, suggesting that the area is particularly active, seismically speaking. Scientists are particularly intrigued because the four quakes also appear to match geophysically speaking, according to NASA. \"Over the course of the mission, we've seen two different types of marsquakes: one that is more 'moon-like' and the other, more 'Earth-like,'\" Taichi Kawamura, a seismologist at France's Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, said in the statement. \"Interestingly all four of these larger quakes, which come from Cerberus Fossae, are 'Earth-like.'\" Meanwhile, the lander is also working on a task that scientists hope will sharpen marsquake observations as the mission continues for another Mars year. Mission personnel suspect that the vast temperature changes between day and night on Mars may be creating \"popping sounds and spikes\" in the seismometer's data as the cable connecting the instrument to the main lander expands and contracts. To try to buffer the cable from these changes, the InSight team is using the lander's robotic arm to scoop Martian soil onto the cable. However, NASA warns that it's a tricky time for the lander, which is powered by solar panels. The worst of the planet's harsh _dust-storm season_ is over, but InSight's lily-pad panels are still covered in dust, despite strong winds in the area. At the same time, the Red Planet is drifting away from the sun along its elliptical orbit, reducing power production. And it's winter by the lander, which means that cold temperatures threaten the robot's electronics. Given the conditions, the mission team expects to need to briefly put the lander and its instruments into hibernation mode later this spring to manage those energy shortages. In July, the orbit of Mars will begin to carry it back toward the sun and reduce the strain on InSight's systems.

InSight, which landed in a Martian plain called Elysium Planitia in 2018, has detected more than 500 Mars quakes, felt more than 10,000 dust devils pass by, and started to measure the planet's core. But over the past few months, InSight has been fighting for its life as the red planet's unpredictable weather threatens to snuff out the robot. Unlike other sites where NASA has sent rovers and landers - including the landing spot of the new Perseverance rover and its Mars helicopter - powerful gusts of wind have not been sweeping Elysium Planitia. These winds, called \"cleaning events,\" are needed to blow the red Martian dust off the solar panels of NASA's robots. Without their help, a thick layer of dust has accumulated on InSight, and it's struggling to absorb sunlight. InSight's solar panels were producing just 27 percent of their energy capacity in February, when winter was arriving in Elysium Planitia. So NASA decided to put the lander in \"hibernation mode,\" switching off different instruments each day. Soon the robot will shut down all functions that aren't necessary for its survival. By pausing its scientific operations, the lander should be able to save enough power to keep its systems warm through the frigid Martian nights, when temperatures can drop to negative-130 degrees Fahrenheit. \"The amount of power available over the next few months will really be driven by the weather,\" Chuck Scott, InSight's project manager, said in a statement. Now almost halfway through its expected hibernation period, InSight is still in good condition, but the risk of a potentially fatal power failure is ever- present. If the lander's batteries die, it might never recover. \"We would be hopeful that we'd be able to bring it back back to life, especially if it's not asleep or dead for a long period of time,\" Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator, told Insider. \"But that would be a dicey situation.\" The agency expects to restart InSight's full operations after Mars swings back toward the sun in July. If it can survive this Martian winter, the lander could keep listening for quakes and tracking weather into 2022. InSight's power shortage contributed to NASA's decision to abandon the lander's \"mole\" in January. That burrowing probe was supposed to measure the temperature deep in the Martian crust - crucial data in the study of the planet's history and internal structure. Now scientists are missing out on even more data as the lander shuts down its instruments. Its Mars weather measurements have become scarce, and in the next month or so, it will stop listening for quakes. Banerdt said he fears the lander could miss some big quakes, but it's worth it to keep the robot alive. If InSight's batteries die, he added, \"it's a good zombie spacecraft\" - meaning it's programmed to recharge and start up again once the sun comes out. \"The problem with that scenario is that in the meantime, the spacecraft is very, very cold. And this is happening during the coldest part of the year for the spacecraft,\" Banerdt said. \"A lot of the electronics is pretty delicate. And it's, unfortunately, pretty likely that something would be damaged by the cold.\" Banerdt suspects that's what happened to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. Both ran out of energy on the Martian surface and were unable to power up again. He's hopeful that InSight won't have to die, though. \"Right now, our predictions, our projections are that we should be able to make it through the lowest-power point and come out the other side,\" Banerdt said. Still, an odd dust storm in the next four or five months could tip the scales by piling more dirt onto InSight's solar panels. That's what happened to Opportunity. But luckily, it's not dust-storm season. \"We think we're pretty well off, but Mars is unpredictable. We never know exactly what's going to happen,\" Banerdt said.

At the Seismological Society of America 's 2021 Annual Meeting, Savas Ceylan of ETH Z\u00fcrich discussed some of the findings from The Marsquake Service, the part of the InSight ground team that detects marsquakes and curates the planet's seismicity catalog. Marsquakes differ from earthquakes in a number of ways, Ceylan explained. To begin with, they are much smaller than earthquakes, with the largest event recorded at teleseismic distances around magnitude 3.6. SEIS is able to detect these small events because the background seismic noise on Mars can be much lower than on Earth, without the constant tremor produced by ocean waves. \"For much of a Martian year, from around sunset until early hours, the Martian atmosphere becomes very quiet, so there is no local noise either,\" he said. \"Additionally, our sensors are optimized and shielded for operating under severe Martian conditions, such as extremely low temperatures and the extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations on the red planet.\" Marsquakes also come in two distinct varieties: low-frequency events with seismic waves propagating at various depths in the planet's mantle, and high- frequency events with waves that appear to propagate through the crust. \"In terms of how the seismic energy decays over time, the low-frequency events appear to be more like earthquakes\" in which the shaking dies away relatively quickly, Ceylan said, \"while the high-frequency events are resembling moonquakes\" in persisting for longer periods. The vast majority of the events are high-frequency and occur at hundreds of kilometers of distance from the lander. \"It is not quite clear to us how these events could be confined to only high frequency energy while they occur at such large distances,\" he said. \"On top of that, the frequency of those events seems to vary over the Martian year, which is a pattern that we do not know at all from Earth.\" Only a handful of marsquakes have clear seismic phase arrivals-the order in which the different types of seismic waves arrive at a location-which allows researchers to calculate the direction and distance the waves come from. All these marsquakes originate from a sunken area of the surface called Cerberus Fossae, about 1800 kilometers away from the InSight Lander. Cerberus Fossae is one of the youngest geological structures on Mars, and may have formed from extensional faulting or subsidence due to dike emplacement. Recent studies suggest extension mechanism may be the source of the Cerberus Fossae quakes, Ceylan noted, \"however, we have a long way in front of us to be able to explain the main tectonic mechanisms behind these quakes.\" The biggest challenge for The Marsquake Service and InSight science team has been \"adapting to unexpected signals in the data from a new planet,\" Ceylan said. Although there were significant efforts to shield SEIS from non-seismic noise by covering it and placing it directly on the Martian surface, its data are still contaminated by weather and lander noise. \"We needed to understand the noise on Mars from scratch, discover how our seismometers behave, how the atmosphere of Mars affects seismic recordings, and find alternative methods to interpret the data properly,\" said Ceylan. It took the Service a while to be \"confident in identifying the different event types,\" he added, \"discriminating these weak signals from the rich and varied background noise, and being able to characterize these novel signals in a systematic manner to provide a self-consistent catalog.\" The InSight seismicity catalog and data are released to the public via IPG Paris, IRIS, and PDS on a three month schedule, with three month data delay.

What we love even more is watching actual NASA engineers trying out a hack and ordering the InSight lander to scoop sand on itself to increase the power from its solar panels. InSight, which recently had its two-year mission to study the interior geology of Mars extended, has been suffering from a buildup of dust on its solar panels. This dust is only adding on to the expected power loss which occurs as the red planet approaches aphelion - the maximum distance from the Sun in its orbit. Attempts to shake the panels clear by pulsing their deployment motors were unsuccessful. Other solar-powered missions have experienced a cleaning effect from the Martian winds; however, despite seeing plenty of gusts, InSight has not seen any significant improvement. Counterintuitively, operators instructed the lander to slowly trickle more dust and sand from its scoop close to one of the solar panels. As the wind blew, larger particles were carried by the breeze across the panels and bounced off the surface, carrying away some accumulated dust. While that may sound like a minuscule effect, the experiment resulted in about 30 extra watt-hours per Sol. Margins are still thin, and science instruments will still need to be disabled to conserve power. But this boost alone was enough to delay the powerdown for a few weeks. There are so many exciting missions operating on Mars right now. Though, it's also fun to take a look back at some of the earliest probes.

NASA's InSight lander touched down on the surface of Mars on November 26, 2018, with a mission to study the planet's seismic activity. After completing its two-year primary mission, NASA approved a two-year extension pushing the lander's capabilities to the limits. Over more than two years of operation on the surface of the Red Planet, InSight's two circular solar panels have become increasingly covered in Martian dust. To combat this, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have been devising novel solutions to the problem. In May, one of the team's more outlandish solutions proved to be successful. The solution proposed using the lander's robotic digging arm to drop a shovel full of Martian dirt near the lander's solar panels during the windiest time of the day. The wind would then blow the dirt across the surface of the solar panels picking up and clearing the fine dust covering the panels. An attempt of this counterintuitive approach was conducted on May 22, the 884th sol of the mission. Immediately following the operation, NASA observed a 30-watt power boost, a gain of approximately 2%. The team's success could not have come at a better time. Mars is approaching aphelion, its farthest point from the Sun. During this period, noticeably less sunlight will reach the lander's solar panels forcing operators to power down InSight's science instruments to ensure core systems have sufficient power. With the recent bump in power, NASA was able to push out the deadline to power down by \"a few weeks.\" This will enable the team to gain valuable science data that they would otherwise not have been able to.

With the nearest duster some 222 million miles away, the Martian regolith has been able to accumulate unchecked. Banerdt said 80% of of the lander's array surfaces are now blocked from the Sun, dropping the amount of available daily energy to less than 700 watt-hours, as opposed to the nearly 5,000 watt-hours that were available when InSight landed at Elysium Planitia in November 2018. It's a situation that's only getting worse, and things could come to a grinding halt during the first quarter of 2022, he added. That the InSight mission might soon be over is sad news but not altogether unexpected. The mission was designed to last for a full Martian year, or 687 Earth days, and the steady decline in energy was expected, according to SpaceNews. Earlier this year, NASA extended the mission to December 2022, with an emphasis on the monitoring of seismic activity. During the primary phase of the mission, InSight collected data about the Martian atmosphere and magnetic field, in addition to detecting marsquakes.

InSight touched down near the Martian equator in November 2018, tasked with probing the planet's interior like never before. The solar-powered lander's main science instruments are a burrowing heat probe and a supersensitive suite of seismometers. The mission team is also using InSight's communications gear to precisely track its location on Mars. This information reveals how much the planet is wobbling on its axis, which sheds further light on its interior structure. The heat probe, nicknamed the \"mole,\" was shut down earlier this year; it never managed to get very far underground, stymied by Martian dirt that was unexpectedly difficult to dig in. But the seismometers have been very productive, recording and characterizing hundreds of marsquakes to date. Analysis of these temblors has allowed the InSight team to map out the _Martian interior in detail. For example, the lander's observations have revealed that the Red Planet has a surprisingly large core and relatively thin crust. The newly detected marsquakes could help sharpen this picture. The InSight team is still studying the Sept. 18 quake, but mission researchers have already characterized the Aug. 25 events to some degree. For example, they've determined that the 4.2-magnitude temblor originated about 5,280 miles from InSight. It's the most distant quake the lander has ever detected, NASA officials said. And it's much farther away than the region that has spawned nearly all of the powerful quakes detected so far by InSight - Cerberus Fossae, an area about 1,000 miles from the lander where lava may have flowed just a few million years ago. The epicenter of Aug. 25's 4.2-magnitude quake remains unclear. \"One especially intriguing possibility is Valles Marineris, the epically long canyon system that scars the Martian equator,\" NASA officials wrote in an update Wednesday. \"The approximate center of that canyon system is 6,027 miles from InSight.\" The 4.1-magnitude temblor from Aug. 25 occurred much closer to the lander - about 575 miles away. And it sported fast, high-frequency vibrations, whereas the 4.2 event's shaking occurred in lower frequencies, NASA officials said. \"Even after more than two years, Mars seems to have given us something new with these two quakes, which have unique characteristics,\" InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said in Wednesday's update. InSight and its handlers overcame considerable adversity to make the newly reported detections. Lots of dust has accumulated on the lander's solar panels since touchdown, reducing its power output dramatically. This problem was compounded recently by Mars' orbital path, which took it farther and farther away from the sun. So the mission team temporarily turned off several instruments to save energy - which InSight's heaters needed more of to deal with the falling temperatures - and cleared some of the dust away. They did this by using the lander's robotic arm to trickle sand onto InSight's solar panels. As the Martian wind swept these granules away, they carried some dust with them. These efforts allowed InSight to maintain relatively steady power levels through aphelion, team members said. \"If we hadn't acted quickly earlier this year, we might have missed out on some great science,\" Banerdt said. The InSight team is considering whether to conduct additional dust-cleaning operations. Such activities, however, would have to wait until after solar conjunction, the period when Mars is on the opposite side of the sun from Earth. NASA suspends communications with Red Planet spacecraft during this time, as commands can be corrupted by solar interference. The InSight team will stop commanding the lander on Sept. 29, likely for about two weeks. The moratorium on commanding Mars spacecraft ends on Oct. 14, NASA officials said.

At the Seismological Society of America 's 2021 Annual Meeting, Savas Ceylan of ETH Z\u00fcrich discussed some of the findings from The Marsquake Service, the part of the InSight ground team that detects marsquakes and curates the planet's seismicity catalog. Marsquakes differ from earthquakes in a number of ways, Ceylan explained. To begin with, they are much smaller than earthquakes, with the largest event recorded at teleseismic distances around magnitude 3.6. SEIS is able to detect these small events because the background seismic noise on Mars can be much lower than on Earth, without the constant tremor produced by ocean waves. \"For much of a Martian year, from around sunset until early hours, the Martian atmosphere becomes very quiet, so there is no local noise either,\" he said. \"Additionally, our sensors are optimized and shielded for operating under severe Martian conditions, such as extremely low temperatures and the extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations on the red planet.\" Marsquakes also come in two distinct varieties: low-frequency events with seismic waves propagating at various depths in the planet's mantle, and high- frequency events with waves that appear to propagate through the crust. \"In terms of how the seismic energy decays over time, the low-frequency events appear to be more like earthquakes\" in which the shaking dies away relatively quickly, Ceylan said, \"while the high-frequency events are resembling moonquakes\" in persisting for longer periods. The vast majority of the events are high-frequency and occur at hundreds of kilometers of distance from the lander. \"It is not quite clear to us how these events could be confined to only high frequency energy while they occur at such large distances,\" he said. \"On top of that, the frequency of those events seems to vary over the Martian year, which is a pattern that we do not know at all from Earth.\" Only a handful of marsquakes have clear seismic phase arrivals-the order in which the different types of seismic waves arrive at a location-which allows researchers to calculate the direction and distance the waves come from. All these marsquakes originate from a sunken area of the surface called Cerberus Fossae, about 1800 kilometers away from the InSight Lander. Cerberus Fossae is one of the youngest geological structures on Mars, and may have formed from extensional faulting or subsidence due to dike emplacement. Recent studies suggest extension mechanism may be the source of the Cerberus Fossae quakes, Ceylan noted, \"however, we have a long way in front of us to be able to explain the main tectonic mechanisms behind these quakes.\" The biggest challenge for The Marsquake Service and InSight science team has been \"adapting to unexpected signals in the data from a new planet,\" Ceylan said. Although there were significant efforts to shield SEIS from non-seismic noise by covering it and placing it directly on the Martian surface, its data are still contaminated by weather and lander noise. \"We needed to understand the noise on Mars from scratch, discover how our seismometers behave, how the atmosphere of Mars affects seismic recordings, and find alternative methods to interpret the data properly,\" said Ceylan. It took the Service a while to be \"confident in identifying the different event types,\" he added, \"discriminating these weak signals from the rich and varied background noise, and being able to characterize these novel signals in a systematic manner to provide a self-consistent catalog.\" The InSight seismicity catalog and data are released to the public via IPG Paris, IRIS, and PDS on a three month schedule, with three month data delay.

NASA's InSight lander touched down on the surface of Mars on November 26, 2018, with a mission to study the planet's seismic activity. After completing its two-year primary mission, NASA approved a two-year extension pushing the lander's capabilities to the limits. Over more than two years of operation on the surface of the Red Planet, InSight's two circular solar panels have become increasingly covered in Martian dust. To combat this, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have been devising novel solutions to the problem. In May, one of the team's more outlandish solutions proved to be successful. The solution proposed using the lander's robotic digging arm to drop a shovel full of Martian dirt near the lander's solar panels during the windiest time of the day.

The steady buildup of dust on the probe's solar arrays has been \"considerable,\" as Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the InSight mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explained during the meeting. With the nearest duster some 222 million miles away, the Martian regolith has been able to accumulate unchecked. Banerdt said 80% of of the lander's array surfaces are now blocked from the Sun, dropping the amount of available daily energy to less than 700 watt-hours, as opposed to the nearly 5,000 watt-hours that were available when InSight landed at Elysium Planitia in November 2018. It's a situation that's only getting worse, and things could come to a grinding halt during the first quarter of 2022, he added. That the InSight mission might soon be over is sad news but not altogether unexpected. The mission was designed to last for a full Martian year, or 687 Earth days, and the steady decline in energy was expected, according to SpaceNews. Earlier this year, NASA extended the mission to December 2022, with an emphasis on the monitoring of seismic activity. During the primary phase of the mission, InSight collected data about the Martian atmosphere and magnetic field, in addition to detecting marsquakes. The lander's Heat Probe and Physical Properties instrument is another story, as the \"mole\" was never able to penetrate deeply into the Martian surface and was ultimately abandoned as a scientific project in January of this year. NASA had hoped for \"cleaning events,\" in which fortuitous gusts of wind might blow some dust off the arrays. They did not. The team tried to shake some dust off by activating motors used to deploy the panels, but that didn't work. They eventually came up with a creative, albeit counterintuitive, solution. InSight's robotic arm was used to sprinkle Martian sand near, but not directly above, the dust-covered panels. The team thought \"it might be possible to strike dust on the panels with sand grains that would 'saltate,' or hop off the solar panel surface and skip through the air in the wind\" and that the \"larger grains might then carry off the smaller dust particles in the wind,\" according to NASA. This was done on May 22, 2021, and worked to a small degree: The technique resulted in a gain of about 30-watt hours of energy per Martian day. At the June 21 meeting, Banerdt said subsequent attempts at saltation offered a slight energy increase and a \"little bit of headroom that we didn't have before,\" as SpaceNews reported. A clever short-term fix, but likely not a long-term solution. Making matters worse, Mars is heading into its aphelion, when the planet will be at its farthest point from the Sun along its orbital path. This will happen two months from now, during which time InSight will have limited access to sunlight. The mission is designed such that the lander can function without its science instruments during this temporary interval. During the aphelion phase, which will last until late October, InSight will reserve power for its heaters, computers, and other critical components, while keeping its seismometer active. At the same time, NASA will refrain from transmitting commands to the stationary lander. Banerdt said there could be \"a month or two of time where we might have to turn off the seismometer, but we're trying to tighten our belts and sharpen our pencils to see whether we can operate straight through.\" Grimly, the situation won't improve much after the aphelion, as Banerdt expects more dust to fall onto the arrays. Eventually, he expects power to fall below survivable levels, an event he predicts for April 2022. Should the lander fail to get a \"significant increase\" in solar array output, \"we're likely to end our mission sometime around that time next year,\" Banerdt said. We've seen this show before. NASA's Opportunity rover stopped transmitting messages on June 10, 2018 and was officially declared dead on February 13, 2019. A global dust storm was blamed for the rover's end. But it's important that we not get too ahead of ourselves here, as InSight has not yet relinquished its mortal coil. This lander, we are hoping, will not go gently into that good Martian night.

To save power and preserve InSight's essential items like heaters in the cold Martian environment, mission managers have already turned off several instruments on the lander. NASA has also tried a new way of encouraging the wind to blow off sand, but with limited success. \"The dust accumulation on the solar arrays has been considerable. We have about 80% obscuration of the arrays,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the InSight mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, according to SpaceNews. Banerdt showed the impact of the declining power levels during a June 21 meeting of NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group. When InSight landed near the Martian equator in November 2018, he said, the robot was generating roughly 5,000 watt-hours of power. Today that level is less than 700 watt-hours. The declining energy levels are not a huge surprise. InSight is in an extended phase of its mission to understand the origin story of the Martian interior and, by extension, that of rocky planets like Earth. A team reviewing the _potential for InSight to extend its mission_ last year warned that the spacecraft's power margins would require new measures to keep going after July 2021. Otherwise, power levels \"are likely to reach critically low levels during the proposed EM extended mission \" that ends in December 2022, compromising potential science return, the panel said at the time. Sometimes a lucky gust of wind from a dust devil can blow accumulated dirt and dust off a spacecraft, as happened during NASA's long-running Spirit and Opportunity Mars rover missions. \"In the case of InSight, the spacecraft's weather sensors have detected many passing whirlwinds, but none have cleared any dust,\" JPL officials said in a statement on June 3. InSight managers have thus been implementing backup plans. They spent more than a year trying to shake off the dust through methods like pulsing the lander's solar array deployment motors but met with little success, JPL officials said. Then, starting on May 22, engineers attempted a new method of budging the dust by using InSight's robotic arm to trickle sand near the panels. If InSight aimed the sand stream just right, some grains were expected to \"saltate,\" or bounce off the solar panel surface, JPL officials said. The bouncing grains skimming off the panels could then carry off some of the smaller dust particles already lying there, using the prevailing Martian winds. \"We had some success with that,\" Banerdt said on June 21 of the various attempts. The first try on May 22 increased energy output by 25 to 30 watt- hours, he said. But the second and third attempts only showed a moderate increase, although he said the three cleanings offered \"a little bit of headroom that we didn't have before.\" Now the managers are trying to triage which, if any, of the science instruments can stay on through aphelion - the farthest Mars gets from the sun during its elliptical orbit, which the planet will reach on July 12. Sensors for weather and magnetic field data are now used sporadically at most. InSight's main instrument, its seismometer suite, has remained operational so far, although Banerdt warned that it may need to be turned off as available light diminishes. \"There may be a month or two of time where we might have to turn off the seismometer, but we're trying to tighten our belts and sharpen our pencils to see whether we can operate straight through,\" Banerdt said. Even after aphelion, he warned, energy levels are expected to fall again by April 2022 due to more dust on the panels and in the atmosphere, along with changes in orbital geometry. \"Unless we get a fairly significant increase in our solar array output, we're likely to end our mission sometime around that time next year,\" Banerdt added, as the mission would fall below its required \"survival energy\" to keep functioning. While relying on solar panels may seem risky in such a dusty environment, doing so lessens the amount of mass at launch, lowering cost and complication for the mission, JPL officials said. Adding dust-removing brushes or fans could add failure points or problems to a long-running mission. Bigger NASA Mars robots such as the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers use nuclear power, making them more flexible in working in severe environments - but also more dependent on dwindling plutonium-238 decay levels over time. Perseverance, which just landed in February, should have enough power to go for 14 years, NASA officials have said. Curiosity is still going strong, nearly nine years after landing on Mars in August 2012. Some members of the public have suggested using the new Mars helicopter Ingenuity to fly near InSight and blow off the dust, JPL officials said. This operation is not only dangerous but impossible, they said, given the sheer distance between the two spacecraft - about 2,145 miles. The next major mission challenge for InSight after aphelion will be around Oct. 7, when Earth and Mars are on opposite sides of the sun. This period of \"solar conjunction\" happens every two years and can interrupt signals between the planets, so NASA stops active communications with its Mars missions for a few weeks as a precaution.

Banerdt said there could be \"a month or two of time where we might have to turn off the seismometer, but we're trying to tighten our belts and sharpen our pencils to see whether we can operate straight through.\" Grimly, the situation won't improve much after the aphelion, as Banerdt expects more dust to fall onto the arrays. Eventually, he expects power to fall below survivable levels, an event he predicts for April 2022. Should the lander fail to get a \"significant increase\" in solar array output, \"we're likely to end our mission sometime around that time next year,\" Banerdt said. We've seen this show before. NASA's Opportunity rover stopped transmitting messages on June 10, 2018 and was officially declared dead on February 13, 2019. A global dust storm was blamed for the rover's end. But it's important that we not get too ahead of ourselves here, as InSight has not yet relinquished its mortal coil. This lander, we are hoping, will not go gently into that good Martian night.

To save power and preserve InSight's essential items like heaters in the cold Martian environment, mission managers have already turned off several instruments on the lander. NASA has also tried a new way of encouraging the wind to blow off sand, but with limited success. \"The dust accumulation on the solar arrays has been considerable. We have about 80% obscuration of the arrays,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator for the InSight mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, according to SpaceNews. Banerdt showed the impact of the declining power levels during a June 21 meeting of NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group. When InSight landed near the Martian equator in November 2018, he said, the robot was generating roughly 5,000 watt-hours of power. Today that level is less than 700 watt-hours. The declining energy levels are not a huge surprise. InSight is in an extended phase of its mission to understand the origin story of the Martian interior and, by extension, that of rocky planets like Earth. A team reviewing the _potential for InSight to extend its mission_ last year warned that the spacecraft's power margins would require new measures to keep going after July 2021. Otherwise, power levels \"are likely to reach critically low levels during the proposed EM extended mission \" that ends in December 2022, compromising potential science return, the panel said at the time. Sometimes a lucky gust of wind from a dust devil can blow accumulated dirt and dust off a spacecraft, as happened during NASA's long-running Spirit and Opportunity Mars rover missions. \"In the case of InSight, the spacecraft's weather sensors have detected many passing whirlwinds, but none have cleared any dust,\" JPL officials said in a statement on June 3. InSight managers have thus been implementing backup plans. They spent more than a year trying to shake off the dust through methods like pulsing the lander's solar array deployment motors but met with little success, JPL officials said. Then, starting on May 22, engineers attempted a new method of budging the dust by using InSight's robotic arm to trickle sand near the panels. If InSight aimed the sand stream just right, some grains were expected to \"saltate,\" or bounce off the solar panel surface, JPL officials said. The bouncing grains skimming off the panels could then carry off some of the smaller dust particles already lying there, using the prevailing Martian winds. \"We had some success with that,\" Banerdt said on June 21 of the various attempts. The first try on May 22 increased energy output by 25 to 30 watt- hours, he said. But the second and third attempts only showed a moderate increase, although he said the three cleanings offered \"a little bit of headroom that we didn't have before.\" Now the managers are trying to triage which, if any, of the science instruments can stay on through aphelion - the farthest Mars gets from the sun during its elliptical orbit, which the planet will reach on July 12. Sensors for weather and magnetic field data are now used sporadically at most. InSight's main instrument, its seismometer suite, has remained operational so far, although Banerdt warned that it may need to be turned off as available light diminishes. \"There may be a month or two of time where we might have to turn off the seismometer, but we're trying to tighten our belts and sharpen our pencils to see whether we can operate straight through,\" Banerdt said. Even after aphelion, he warned, energy levels are expected to fall again by April 2022 due to more dust on the panels and in the atmosphere, along with changes in orbital geometry. \"Unless we get a fairly significant increase in our solar array output, we're likely to end our mission sometime around that time next year,\" Banerdt added, as the mission would fall below its required \"survival energy\" to keep functioning. While relying on solar panels may seem risky in such a dusty environment, doing so lessens the amount of mass at launch, lowering cost and complication for the mission, JPL officials said. Adding dust-removing brushes or fans could add failure points or problems to a long-running mission. Bigger NASA Mars robots such as the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers use nuclear power, making them more flexible in working in severe environments - but also more dependent on dwindling plutonium-238 decay levels over time. Perseverance, which just landed in February, should have enough power to go for 14 years, NASA officials have said. Curiosity is still going strong, nearly nine years after landing on Mars in August 2012. Some members of the public have suggested using the new Mars helicopter Ingenuity to fly near InSight and blow off the dust, JPL officials said. This operation is not only dangerous but impossible, they said, given the sheer distance between the two spacecraft - about 2,145 miles. The next major mission challenge for InSight after aphelion will be around Oct. 7, when Earth and Mars are on opposite sides of the sun. This period of \"solar conjunction\" happens every two years and can interrupt signals between the planets, so NASA stops active communications with its Mars missions for a few weeks as a precaution.

Analysis of these temblors has allowed the InSight team to map out the _Martian interior in detail. For example, the lander's observations have revealed that the Red Planet has a surprisingly large core and relatively thin crust. The newly detected marsquakes could help sharpen this picture. The InSight team is still studying the Sept. 18 quake, but mission researchers have already characterized the Aug. 25 events to some degree. For example, they've determined that the 4.2-magnitude temblor originated about 5,280 miles from InSight. It's the most distant quake the lander has ever detected, NASA officials said. And it's much farther away than the region that has spawned nearly all of the powerful quakes detected so far by InSight - Cerberus Fossae, an area about 1,000 miles from the lander where lava may have flowed just a few million years ago. The epicenter of Aug. 25's 4.2-magnitude quake remains unclear. \"One especially intriguing possibility is Valles Marineris, the epically long canyon system that scars the Martian equator,\" NASA officials wrote in an update Wednesday. \"The approximate center of that canyon system is 6,027 miles from InSight.\" The 4.1-magnitude temblor from Aug. 25 occurred much closer to the lander - about 575 miles away.

InSight and its handlers overcame considerable adversity to make the newly reported detections. Lots of dust has accumulated on the lander's solar panels since touchdown, reducing its power output dramatically. This problem was compounded recently by Mars' orbital path, which took it farther and farther away from the sun. So the mission team temporarily turned off several instruments to save energy - which InSight's heaters needed more of to deal with the falling temperatures - and cleared some of the dust away. They did this by using the lander's robotic arm to trickle sand onto InSight's solar panels. As the Martian wind swept these granules away, they carried some dust with them.

The mission is looking for tectonic activity and meteorite impacts, studying how much heat is still flowing through the planet, and tracking Mars' wobble as it orbits the sun. Seismic data collected in Elysium Planitia, the second largest volcanic region on Mars, suggest the presence of a shallow sedimentary layer sandwiched between lava flows beneath the planet's surface. These findings were gained in the framework of NASA's InSight mission, in which several international research partners, including the University of Cologne, collaborate. The paper 'The shallow structure of Mars at the InSight landing site from inversion of ambient vibrations' was published in _Nature Communications_ on November 23, 2021. Geophysicist Dr. C\u00e9dric Schmelzbach from ETH Zurich and colleagues, including the earthquake specialists Dr. Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun and doctoral researcher Sebastian Carrasco from the University of Cologne's Seismic Observatory in Bensberg, used seismic data to analyze the composition of the Elysium Planitia region. The authors examined the shallow subsurface to around 200 meters in depth. Right beneath the surface, they discovered a regolith layer of dominantly sandy material approximately three meters thick above a 15 meter layer of coarse blocky ejecta - rocky blocks that were ejected after a meteorite impact and fell back to the surface. Below these top layers, they identified around 150 meters of basaltic rocks, i.e., cooled and solidified lava flows, which was largely consistent with the expected subsurface structure. However, between these lava flows, starting at a depth of about 30 meters, the authors identified an additional layer 30 to 40 meters thick with low seismic velocity, suggesting it contains weak sedimentary materials relative to the stronger basalt layers. To date the shallower lava flows, the authors used crater counts from existing literature. Established knowledge about the impact rate of meteorites allows geologists to date rocks: surfaces with many impact craters from meteorites are older than ones with fewer craters. Also, craters with larger diameters extend into the lower layer, allowing the scientists to date the deep rock, while smaller ones allow them to date the shallower rock layers. They found that the shallower lava flows are approximately 1.7 billion years old, forming during the Amazonian period - a geological era on Mars characterized by low rates of meteorite and asteroid impacts and by cold, hyper-arid conditions, which began approximately 3 billion years ago. In contrast, the deeper basalt layer below the sediments formed much earlier, approximately 3.6 billion years ago during the Hesperian period, which was characterized by widespread volcanic activity. The authors propose that the intermediate layer with low volcanic velocities could be composed of sedimentary deposits sandwiched between the Hesperian and Amazonian basalts, or within the Amazonian basalts themselves. These results provide the first opportunity to compare seismic ground-truth measurements of the shallow subsurface to prior predictions based on orbital geological mapping. Prior to the landing, Dr. Knapmeyer-Endrun had already developed models of the velocity structure of the shallow subsurface at the InSight landing site based on terrestrial analogs. The actual measurements now indicate additional layering as well as more porous rocks in general. 'While the results help to better understand the geological processes in Elysium Planitia, comparison with pre-landing models is also valuable for future landed missions, since it can help to refine predictions,' Knapmeyer- Endrun remarked. Knowledge of the properties of the shallow subsurface is required to assess, for example, its load-bearing capacity and trafficability for rovers. Besides, details on the layering in the shallow subsurface help to understand where it might still contain ground water or ice.

This is probably just a temporary reprieve, however, for InSight is losing its battle with dust over the long haul.

InSight touched down near the Martian equator in November 2018, on a mission to help scientists understand the planet's interior structure and composition like never before.

InSight carries a burrowing heat probe as well, but the little digger failed to get deep enough on Mars to return the desired heat- flow data. InSight's primary mission lasted one Mars year, which is about 687 Earth days. The lander is currently operating during an extended mission, which is funded through the end of the year. InSight team members will try to get the lander through that finish line, though success is far from guaranteed. \"Having completed all primary mission science objectives, the goal now is to enable the spacecraft to operate through the end of its extended mission in December,\" Tuesday's update states. \"A passing whirlwind that removes dust or a new dust storm that increases the dust accumulation could alter the timeline.\" Mike Wall is the author of \"Out There\", a book about the search for alien life.

InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is designed to give the Red Planet its first thorough check up since it formed 4.5 billion years ago. The mission is looking for tectonic activity and meteorite impacts, studying how much heat is still flowing through the planet, and tracking Mars' wobble as it orbits the sun. Seismic data collected in Elysium Planitia, the second largest volcanic region on Mars, suggest the presence of a shallow sedimentary layer sandwiched between lava flows beneath the planet's surface. These findings were gained in the framework of NASA's InSight mission, in which several international research partners, including the University of Cologne, collaborate. The paper 'The shallow structure of Mars at the InSight landing site from inversion of ambient vibrations' was published in _Nature Communications_ on November 23, 2021. Geophysicist Dr. C\u00e9dric Schmelzbach from ETH Zurich and colleagues, including the earthquake specialists Dr. Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun and doctoral researcher Sebastian Carrasco from the University of Cologne's Seismic Observatory in Bensberg, used seismic data to analyze the composition of the Elysium Planitia region. The authors examined the shallow subsurface to around 200 meters in depth. Right beneath the surface, they discovered a regolith layer of dominantly sandy material approximately three meters thick above a 15 meter layer of coarse blocky ejecta - rocky blocks that were ejected after a meteorite impact and fell back to the surface. Below these top layers, they identified around 150 meters of basaltic rocks, i.e., cooled and solidified lava flows, which was largely consistent with the expected subsurface structure. However, between these lava flows, starting at a depth of about 30 meters, the authors identified an additional layer 30 to 40 meters thick with low seismic velocity, suggesting it contains weak sedimentary materials relative to the stronger basalt layers. To date the shallower lava flows, the authors used crater counts from existing literature. Established knowledge about the impact rate of meteorites allows geologists to date rocks: surfaces with many impact craters from meteorites are older than ones with fewer craters. Also, craters with larger diameters extend into the lower layer, allowing the scientists to date the deep rock, while smaller ones allow them to date the shallower rock layers. They found that the shallower lava flows are approximately 1.7 billion years old, forming during the Amazonian period - a geological era on Mars characterized by low rates of meteorite and asteroid impacts and by cold, hyper-arid conditions, which began approximately 3 billion years ago. In contrast, the deeper basalt layer below the sediments formed much earlier, approximately 3.6 billion years ago during the Hesperian period, which was characterized by widespread volcanic activity. The authors propose that the intermediate layer with low volcanic velocities could be composed of sedimentary deposits sandwiched between the Hesperian and Amazonian basalts, or within the Amazonian basalts themselves. These results provide the first opportunity to compare seismic ground-truth measurements of the shallow subsurface to prior predictions based on orbital geological mapping. Prior to the landing, Dr. Knapmeyer-Endrun had already developed models of the velocity structure of the shallow subsurface at the InSight landing site based on terrestrial analogs. The actual measurements now indicate additional layering as well as more porous rocks in general. 'While the results help to better understand the geological processes in Elysium Planitia, comparison with pre-landing models is also valuable for future landed missions, since it can help to refine predictions,' Knapmeyer- Endrun remarked. Knowledge of the properties of the shallow subsurface is required to assess, for example, its load-bearing capacity and trafficability for rovers. Besides, details on the layering in the shallow subsurface help to understand where it might still contain ground water or ice. Within the framework of his doctoral research at the University of Cologne, Sebastian Carrasco will continue to analyze the effect of the shallow structure of Elysium Planitia on marsquake recordings.

Recently, NASA shared the mesmerising picture taken by the InSight lander of the Martian dawn on the plains of Elysium Planitia. NASA took to Instagram to share the photo which was taken back on April 10, 2022, the 1198th Martian day of its mission. Talking about InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport is NASA's first mission to study the interior of Mars - from its crust, mantle, and core. InSight is the first outer space robotic explorer to study in-depth the \"inner space\" of Mars. In November 2018, the Mars lander InSight landed down in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars. The mission has already completed its preliminary mission of one full Martian year. One Martian year is equal to about 687 days on Earth. Right now, it is in its extended phase with time on its hand to try its photography skills. The lander uses cutting edge instruments, to delve deep beneath the surface and seek the fingerprints of the processes that formed the terrestrial planets. It does so by measuring the planet's vital signs such as its \"pulse\", \"temperature\", and \"reflexes\". According to NASA, studying about the interior structure of Mars helps to answer key questions about the early formation of rocky planets in our inner solar system such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars which have been formed around more than 4 billion years ago, as well as rocky exoplanets. NASA mentions that InSight has measured hundreds of \"Marsquakes\", studied mysterious magnetic pulses, and provided incredible views like this one, the Martian sunrise. NASA says that the learning from InSight will not only reveal how planets like Mars first formed, it will help to understand the Red Planet's patterns as in future for the preparation for humans to explore Mars on NASA missions. Not just InSight, NASA has been exploring Mars with other missions such as the Perseverance rover which is collecting rock samples.

You can see the red Martian regolith covering the lander, which touched down in November 2018, in a high-definition image acquired April 9 from the agency's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The spacecraft's High Resolution Imaging Experiment is often tasked with taking detailed pictures of spacecraft on the surface, especially when a robot finds itself in difficult circumstances. The InSight Mars lander went into safe mode in January briefly after so much dust covered its solar panels that little solar power was available to the lander, although power production has since recovered. \"Long-term change detection at sites, like the InSight landing area, tells us how dust moves around Mars and helps us understand how the surface evolves over time,\" the University of Arizona, which manages HiRISE, stated Friday. The agency said in a February update that it expects power to continue only until midyear or so. \"The solar panels of NASA's InSight lander are producing almost as much power as they did before the January storm. That power level should enable the lander to continue science operations into the summer,\" the update stated. Images taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show InSight shortly after landing and in March 2022. The photo on the left shows the blast zone created by the robot's November 2018 landing, as well as the parachute that helped the mission reach the surface. In the photo on the right, three and a half years' worth of dust have largely hidden these signs of spacecraft activity. InSight, which landed on the Red Planet in 2018, has been working on reduced power for a while due to dust buildup on its twin solar panels. Engineers managed to remove some dust on a single panel in 2021, by drizzling sand over the panel. But InSight hasn't been lucky enough to get a gust of wind to brush dust away. As a result, last year, NASA warned that reduced power availability could end InSight's operations sometimes in 2022. Compounding the issue is the natural orbital cycle of Mars. In 2021, the planet reached its greatest distance from the sun, weakening available solar power, and seasonal cycles of dust activities are picking up. The InSight lander, which was designed to last one Martian year is focused on understanding the interior of Mars, in particular by observing the Red Planet temblors dubbed marsquakes.

NASA took to Instagram to share the photo which was taken back on April 10, 2022, the 1198th Martian day of its mission. Talking about InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport is NASA's first mission to study the interior of Mars - from its crust, mantle, and core. InSight is the first outer space robotic explorer to study in-depth the \"inner space\" of Mars. In November 2018, the Mars lander InSight landed down in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars. The mission has already completed its preliminary mission of one full Martian year. One Martian year is equal to about 687 days on Earth. Right now, it is in its extended phase with time on its hand to try its photography skills. The lander uses cutting edge instruments, to delve deep beneath the surface and seek the fingerprints of the processes that formed the terrestrial planets. It does so by measuring the planet's vital signs such as its \"pulse\", \"temperature\", and \"reflexes\". According to NASA, studying about the interior structure of Mars helps to answer key questions about the early formation of rocky planets in our inner solar system such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars which have been formed around more than 4 billion years ago, as well as rocky exoplanets. NASA mentions that InSight has measured hundreds of \"Marsquakes\", studied mysterious magnetic pulses, and provided incredible views like this one, the Martian sunrise. NASA says that the learning from InSight will not only reveal how planets like Mars first formed, it will help to understand the Red Planet's patterns as in future for the preparation for humans to explore Mars on NASA missions. Not just InSight, NASA has been exploring Mars with other missions such as the Perseverance rover which is collecting rock samples.

The InSight Mars lander went into safe mode in January briefly after so much dust covered its solar panels that little solar power was available to the lander, although power production has since recovered. \"Long-term change detection at sites, like the InSight landing area, tells us how dust moves around Mars and helps us understand how the surface evolves over time,\" the University of Arizona, which manages HiRISE, stated Friday. The agency said in a February update that it expects power to continue only until midyear or so. \"The solar panels of NASA's InSight lander are producing almost as much power as they did before the January storm.

As a result, last year, NASA warned that reduced power availability could end InSight's operations sometimes in 2022. Compounding the issue is the natural orbital cycle of Mars. In 2021, the planet reached its greatest distance from the sun, weakening available solar power, and seasonal cycles of dust activities are picking up.

During its time on the Red Planet, InSight has achieved all its primary science goals and continues to hunt for quakes on Mars. The mission is the first to reveal the interior structure of Mars, using marsquakes to study the layers inside the planet. InSight's seismometer was the first to detect a quake on another planet. InSight also measured weather at Elysium Planitia for four years with a unique set of meteorological sensors. InSight has also persisted through adversity. The team found innovative ways to take on engineering challenges they encountered. InSight's findings help scientists understand how all rocky worlds, including Earth and its Moon, formed. Touchdown confirmed. InSight has been fantastically successful. We've gotten more science than we had ever dreamed that we would get during the course of this mission. Insight's primary goal was to better understand how the terrestrial planets, the rocky planets formed and evolved. First, we landed an incredibly sensitive seismometer on the surface of Mars, and with that we are able to record over 1300 Mars quakes. And these range all the way from tiny little temblors that just barely go over the noise background to a handful of quakes that were larger than magnitude four. And feeling those vibrations the scientists can actually take that information and use that to reconstruct all the material that those Mars quakes traveled through and thereby see the interior of the planet. We looked at its core, which is big and not very dense.We looked at its mantle, which is not so hot, and we looked at its crust, which is not too thick and not too dense compared to some of our permission expectations. By measuring the detailed structure of the inside of Mars, it gives us a snapshot of what the planet looked like. Four and a half billion years ago. The other thing that we've been able to do is make a very detailed record of the weather at Mars. But we have a really good weather station which has allowed meteorologists to study the weather at the at the Insight Landing site and relate that to the climate changes on Mars. What we didn't do, unfortunately, was make the heat flow measurement we wanted to make. Our heat flow probe was supposed to get 3 to 5 meters down,and we were unable to reach that depth. But we were able to get some of those measurements,such as the heat transfer among the soil. InSight is a solar powered mission. We have solar panels, and they were designed to give us enough power to easily get through the first two years. But there's a lot of dust in Mars's atmosphere, and that's falling down on top of our solar arrays and slowly blocking the sun. As the panels are getting dustier. We started wracking our brains of whether there's anything we can do to try to clean off those panels ourselves. When the idea of using dirt to clean the solar arrays was first proposed, it seemed counterintuitive. We were actually able to use the arm and the scoop to scoop up some soil from the ground and dump it over the lander, having some of that heavier sand blow onto the arrays and knock some of the dust off. So we essentially used it as an array cleaning tool. Cleaning with dirt actually worked! It allowed us to actually keep the instruments going during the low power season where the Mars is farthest from the sun during the winter. Unfortunately, later in the summer, we think that the power is going to be dropping so quickly due to the atmosphere getting dustier due to the alignment of Mars and the sun. We're going to be at a point where we can no longer have all of our instruments on, which means we'll be turning off the seismometer and other instruments on board.The last day is going to be bittersweet. Obviously, we're preparing for it. We know it's coming. But that first moment where we don't hear from the lander when we expect to, that's going to be tough. It's left a permanent mark on me and I literally tattooed InSight onto my arm. I'll never let it go. We've really rewritten sort of the chapter of the encyclopedia on the interior of Mars. That was our last big hole in our understanding of the planet. There's a lot of data that people are going to be looking at for decades to come.

The InSight lander is losing power because of all the dust on its solar panels. NASA said on May 17 that it will keep using the spacecraft's seismometer to register marsquakes until the power peters out, likely in July. Then flight controllers will monitor InSight until the end of this year, before calling everything off. \"There really hasn't been too much doom and gloom on the team. We're really still focused on operating the spacecraft,\" said Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Bruce Banerdt, the principal scientist. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has detected more than 1,300 marsquakes; the biggest one, a magnitude 5, occurred two weeks ago. It will be NASA's second Mars lander lost to dust: A global dust storm took out Opportunity in 2018. In InSight's case, it's been a gradual gathering of dust, especially over the past year. NASA's two other functioning spacecraft on the Martian surface - rovers Curiosity and Perseverance - are still going strong thanks to nuclear power. The space agency may rethink solar power in the future for Mars, said planetary science director Lori Glaze, or at least experiment with new panel- clearing tech or aim for the less-stormy seasons. InSight currently is generating one-tenth of the power from the sun than it did upon arrival. Deputy project manager Kathya Zamora Garcia said the lander initially had enough power to run an electric oven for one hour and 40 minutes; now it's down to 10 minutes max. The InSight team anticipated this much dust build-up but hoped a gust of wind or dust devil might clean off the solar panels. That has yet to happen, despite several thousand whirlwinds coming close. \"None of them have quite hit us dead-on yet enough to blow the dust off the panels,\" Banerdt told reporters. Another science instrument, dubbed the mole, was supposed to burrow 16 feet underground to measure the internal temperature of Mars. But the German digger never got deeper than a couple of feet because of the unexpected composition of the red dirt, and it finally was declared dead at the beginning of last year.

The lander will, however, leave behind a legacy of data that will be tapped by scientists around the world for years to come, helping to improve our understanding of planet formation, NASA said, while announcing on Tuesday the imminent end to InSight's science operations. Equipped with an ultra-sensitive seismometer, InSight recorded more than 1,300 \"marsquakes,\" including a magnitude 5 quake on May 4, the largest so far. But around July, the seismometer will be turned off. The lander's energy level will then be checked about once a day, and some pictures may still be taken. Then by the end of this year, the mission will be completely stopped. The cause: the accumulation over months of Martian dust on the lander's two solar panels, each measuring about 2.2 meters wide. InSight, which is already running on only a tenth of the energy it had at the beginning, will soon find its batteries drained. The speed at which dust accumulated corresponded more or less to what had been estimated by NASA. The lander got a new lease on life around a year ago, when its robotic arm was put to new and unplanned use to remove some dust from the solar panels, extending the mission. The maneuver - employed six times successfully - saw the arm use dust itself to clear the panels, as it scooped up some martian soil and gently dropped onto the robot so the dirt was blown across the solar panels, clearing parts of their surface. Adding something to the lander specifically to clean the panels was forgone due to costs, explained Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, during a press conference Tuesday. Such a mechanism would leave \"less to put into the science instruments,\" he said. InSight, one of four missions currently on the Red Planet - along with the US rovers Perseverance and Curiosity, and China's Zhurong - arrived on Mars in November 2018. Its seismometer, made in France, has since paved the way for great advances. \"The interior was kind of just a giant question mark,\" said Banerdt, who has worked on the InSight mission for more than a decade. But thanks to InSight, \"we've been able to map out the inside of Mars for the very first time in history.\" Seismic waves, varying based on the materials they pass through, offer a picture of the interior of the planet. For example, scientists were able to confirm that the core of Mars is liquid and to determine the thickness of the Martian crust - less dense than previously thought and likely consisting of three layers. The magnitude 5 quake in early May was much larger than all those previously recorded and close to what scientists thought would be the maximum on Mars, though it would not be considered a huge tremor on Earth. \"This quake is really going to be a treasure trove of scientific information when we get our teeth into it,\" Banerdt said. Earthquakes are in particular caused by plate tectonics, he explained. But, they can also be triggered when the Earth's crust moves due to temperature anomalies caused by its mantle. It is this type of vibration that scientists think they are dealing with on Mars. Not all of InSight's scientific operations have gone smoothly, however, such as when its heat probe had trouble being successfully buried below the surface to take the planet's temperature because of the composition of the soil where the robot landed. Regardless, in light of the seismometer's success, NASA is considering using the technique elsewhere in the future, said Lori Glaze, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. \"We'd really like to set up a complete network on the moon to really understand what's going on there.\" ", "url": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2022/05/19/2003778447"}, {"title": "InSight's Final Selfie - NASA's InSight Mars Lander", "date": "2022-05-23", "content": "NASA's InSight Mars lander took this final selfie on April 24, 2022, the 1,211th Martian day, or sol, of the mission.

The stationary spacecraft captured the image on April 24 using its robotic arm, which will soon be placed into a final resting position called \"retirement pose\" this month. In order to take a selfie, the arm has to move several times, and that won't be possible anymore. \"Before losing more solar energy, I took some time to take in my surroundings and snapped my final selfie before I rest my arm and camera permanently in the stowed position,\" the InSight account tweeted on Tuesday. Due to a decreasing power supply, the mission will cease scientific operations by the end of late summer. It has been revealing the mysterious interior of Mars since landing in November 2018. InSight's solar panels have been increasingly covered in red Martian dust, despite creative efforts by the mission's team on Earth. This accumulation will only worsen as Mars now enters winter, when more dust is lofted into the atmosphere. These floating particles reduce the sunlight necessary to charge the solar panels that power InSight, which is currently working on an extended mission that was expected to last through December. The mission achieved its primary goals after its first two years on Mars.

The lander went into safe mode on May 7, when its energy levels dropped, causing it to cease everything but essential functions. The team anticipates this could happen more frequently in the future as dust levels increase. The stationary lander is only able to collect about one-tenth of the available power supply it had after landing on Mars in November 2018. When InSight first landed, it could produce about 5,000 watt-hours each day on Mars, the equivalent of what it takes to power an electric oven for an hour and 40 minutes. Now, the lander produces 500 watt-hours per day, enough to power an electric oven for just 10 minutes. If 25% of the solar panels were cleaned, InSight would experience a power boost sufficient to keep it going. The spacecraft has witnessed many dust devils, or whirlwinds, but none have been close enough to clear off the solar panels. \"We've been hoping for a dust cleaning like we saw happen several times to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a statement. \"That's still possible, but energy is low enough that our focus is making the most of the science we can still collect.\" By the end of the summer, the team will turn off the seismometer, end science operations, and monitor what power levels remain on the lander. At the end of the year, the InSight mission will conclude. The InSight team, however, will still listen for any possible communication from the spacecraft and determine if it could ever operate again. The lander's highly sensitive seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, has detected more than 1,300 marsquakes from hundreds and thousands of miles away. InSight detected the largest one yet, a magnitude 5, on May 4. \"Even as we're starting to get close to the end of our mission, Mars is still giving us some really amazing things to see,\" Banerdt said. The data collected by InSight so far has revealed new details about the little-known Martian core, interior layers and crust. It has also recorded weather data and analyzed the remains of the magnetic field that once existed on Mars. InSight's steady stream of data heading to scientists on Earth will stop when the solar cells can no longer generate enough power. But researchers will be studying the detections made by InSight for decades to come in order to learn as much as possible about our enigmatic planetary neighbor.

InSight, a marsquake-seeking lander, alighted on the surface in 2018 on a bid to better understand the interior of Mars.

Still, the agency says InSight will likely run too low on power later this year to conduct new science. But the mission's science value is signaled by the agency's extensions to its work; the lander's primary mission lasted one Martian year, or nearly two Earth years. InSight didn't include a secondary system to clean off dust, relying instead on passing dust devils or strong breezes to clean the lander. Engineers did manage to remove a bit of dust in 2021 by drizzling sand on the lander and allowing wind to blow that sand across the panel, however.

The marsquake-tracking device will run for a little while longer, but is expected to be turned off late in the summer. That said, InSight might get lucky before that point. Its power may last a little longer than expected, or a passing breeze may finally push some of the dust away and allow the lander to squeak out a little more science later in the year. \"It's exceeded our expectations at just about every turn on Mars, and so it may actually last longer than that,\" Bruce Banerdt, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's principal investigator for the mission, told reporters during the May 17 press conference.

However, due to dust accumulation on its solar panels, InSight's electrical power production is dropping, and the mission is unlikely to continue operations for the duration of its current extended mission unless its solar panels are cleared by a passing \"dust devil\" in Mars' atmosphere.

During its time on the Red Planet, InSight has achieved all its primary science goals and continues to hunt for quakes on Mars. The mission is the first to reveal the interior structure of Mars, using marsquakes to study the layers inside the planet. InSight's seismometer was the first to detect a quake on another planet. InSight also measured weather at Elysium Planitia for four years with a unique set of meteorological sensors. InSight has also persisted through adversity. The team found innovative ways to take on engineering challenges they encountered. InSight's findings help scientists understand how all rocky worlds, including Earth and its Moon, formed. Touchdown confirmed. InSight has been fantastically successful. We've gotten more science than we had ever dreamed that we would get during the course of this mission. Insight's primary goal was to better understand how the terrestrial planets, the rocky planets formed and evolved. First, we landed an incredibly sensitive seismometer on the surface of Mars, and with that we are able to record over 1300 Mars quakes. And these range all the way from tiny little temblors that just barely go over the noise background to a handful of quakes that were larger than magnitude four. And feeling those vibrations the scientists can actually take that information and use that to reconstruct all the material that those Mars quakes traveled through and thereby see the interior of the planet. We looked at its core, which is big and not very dense.We looked at its mantle, which is not so hot, and we looked at its crust, which is not too thick and not too dense compared to some of our permission expectations. By measuring the detailed structure of the inside of Mars, it gives us a snapshot of what the planet looked like. Four and a half billion years ago. The other thing that we've been able to do is make a very detailed record of the weather at Mars. But we have a really good weather station which has allowed meteorologists to study the weather at the at the Insight Landing site and relate that to the climate changes on Mars. What we didn't do, unfortunately, was make the heat flow measurement we wanted to make. Our heat flow probe was supposed to get 3 to 5 meters down,and we were unable to reach that depth. But we were able to get some of those measurements,such as the heat transfer among the soil. InSight is a solar powered mission. We have solar panels, and they were designed to give us enough power to easily get through the first two years. But there's a lot of dust in Mars's atmosphere, and that's falling down on top of our solar arrays and slowly blocking the sun. As the panels are getting dustier. We started wracking our brains of whether there's anything we can do to try to clean off those panels ourselves. When the idea of using dirt to clean the solar arrays was first proposed, it seemed counterintuitive. We were actually able to use the arm and the scoop to scoop up some soil from the ground and dump it over the lander, having some of that heavier sand blow onto the arrays and knock some of the dust off. So we essentially used it as an array cleaning tool. Cleaning with dirt actually worked! It allowed us to actually keep the instruments going during the low power season where the Mars is farthest from the sun during the winter. Unfortunately, later in the summer, we think that the power is going to be dropping so quickly due to the atmosphere getting dustier due to the alignment of Mars and the sun. We're going to be at a point where we can no longer have all of our instruments on, which means we'll be turning off the seismometer and other instruments on board.The last day is going to be bittersweet. Obviously, we're preparing for it. We know it's coming. But that first moment where we don't hear from the lander when we expect to, that's going to be tough. It's left a permanent mark on me and I literally tattooed InSight onto my arm. I'll never let it go. We've really rewritten sort of the chapter of the encyclopedia on the interior of Mars. That was our last big hole in our understanding of the planet. There's a lot of data that people are going to be looking at for decades to come.

The InSight lander is losing power because of all the dust on its solar panels. NASA said on May 17 that it will keep using the spacecraft's seismometer to register marsquakes until the power peters out, likely in July. Then flight controllers will monitor InSight until the end of this year, before calling everything off. \"There really hasn't been too much doom and gloom on the team. We're really still focused on operating the spacecraft,\" said Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Bruce Banerdt, the principal scientist. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has detected more than 1,300 marsquakes; the biggest one, a magnitude 5, occurred two weeks ago. It will be NASA's second Mars lander lost to dust: A global dust storm took out Opportunity in 2018. In InSight's case, it's been a gradual gathering of dust, especially over the past year. NASA's two other functioning spacecraft on the Martian surface - rovers Curiosity and Perseverance - are still going strong thanks to nuclear power. The space agency may rethink solar power in the future for Mars, said planetary science director Lori Glaze, or at least experiment with new panel- clearing tech or aim for the less-stormy seasons. InSight currently is generating one-tenth of the power from the sun than it did upon arrival. Deputy project manager Kathya Zamora Garcia said the lander initially had enough power to run an electric oven for one hour and 40 minutes; now it's down to 10 minutes max. The InSight team anticipated this much dust build-up but hoped a gust of wind or dust devil might clean off the solar panels. That has yet to happen, despite several thousand whirlwinds coming close. \"None of them have quite hit us dead-on yet enough to blow the dust off the panels,\" Banerdt told reporters. Another science instrument, dubbed the mole, was supposed to burrow 16 feet underground to measure the internal temperature of Mars. But the German digger never got deeper than a couple of feet because of the unexpected composition of the red dirt, and it finally was declared dead at the beginning of last year.

The lander will, however, leave behind a legacy of data that will be tapped by scientists around the world for years to come, helping to improve our understanding of planet formation, NASA said, while announcing on Tuesday the imminent end to InSight's science operations. Equipped with an ultra-sensitive seismometer, InSight recorded more than 1,300 \"marsquakes,\" including a magnitude 5 quake on May 4, the largest so far. But around July, the seismometer will be turned off. The lander's energy level will then be checked about once a day, and some pictures may still be taken. Then by the end of this year, the mission will be completely stopped. The cause: the accumulation over months of Martian dust on the lander's two solar panels, each measuring about 2.2 meters wide. InSight, which is already running on only a tenth of the energy it had at the beginning, will soon find its batteries drained. The speed at which dust accumulated corresponded more or less to what had been estimated by NASA. The lander got a new lease on life around a year ago, when its robotic arm was put to new and unplanned use to remove some dust from the solar panels, extending the mission. The maneuver - employed six times successfully - saw the arm use dust itself to clear the panels, as it scooped up some martian soil and gently dropped onto the robot so the dirt was blown across the solar panels, clearing parts of their surface. Adding something to the lander specifically to clean the panels was forgone due to costs, explained Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, during a press conference Tuesday. Such a mechanism would leave \"less to put into the science instruments,\" he said. InSight, one of four missions currently on the Red Planet - along with the US rovers Perseverance and Curiosity, and China's Zhurong - arrived on Mars in November 2018. Its seismometer, made in France, has since paved the way for great advances. \"The interior was kind of just a giant question mark,\" said Banerdt, who has worked on the InSight mission for more than a decade. But thanks to InSight, \"we've been able to map out the inside of Mars for the very first time in history.\" Seismic waves, varying based on the materials they pass through, offer a picture of the interior of the planet. For example, scientists were able to confirm that the core of Mars is liquid and to determine the thickness of the Martian crust - less dense than previously thought and likely consisting of three layers. The magnitude 5 quake in early May was much larger than all those previously recorded and close to what scientists thought would be the maximum on Mars, though it would not be considered a huge tremor on Earth. \"This quake is really going to be a treasure trove of scientific information when we get our teeth into it,\" Banerdt said. Earthquakes are in particular caused by plate tectonics, he explained. But, they can also be triggered when the Earth's crust moves due to temperature anomalies caused by its mantle. It is this type of vibration that scientists think they are dealing with on Mars. Not all of InSight's scientific operations have gone smoothly, however, such as when its heat probe had trouble being successfully buried below the surface to take the planet's temperature because of the composition of the soil where the robot landed. Regardless, in light of the seismometer's success, NASA is considering using the technique elsewhere in the future, said Lori Glaze, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. \"We'd really like to set up a complete network on the moon to really understand what's going on there.\" ", "url": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2022/05/19/2003778447"}, {"title": "InSight's Final Selfie - NASA's InSight Mars Lander", "date": "2022-05-23", "content": "NASA's InSight Mars lander took this final selfie on April 24, 2022, the 1,211th Martian day, or sol, of the mission.

And judging by the amount of dust coating the lander's solar panels, it's easy to see why. The stationary spacecraft captured the image on April 24 using its robotic arm, which will soon be placed into a final resting position called \"retirement pose\" this month. In order to take a selfie, the arm has to move several times, and that won't be possible anymore. \"Before losing more solar energy, I took some time to take in my surroundings and snapped my final selfie before I rest my arm and camera permanently in the stowed position,\" the InSight account tweeted on Tuesday. Due to a decreasing power supply, the mission will cease scientific operations by the end of late summer. It has been revealing the mysterious interior of Mars since landing in November 2018. InSight's solar panels have been increasingly covered in red Martian dust, despite creative efforts by the mission's team on Earth. This accumulation will only worsen as Mars now enters winter, when more dust is lofted into the atmosphere. These floating particles reduce the sunlight necessary to charge the solar panels that power InSight, which is currently working on an extended mission that was expected to last through December. The mission achieved its primary goals after its first two years on Mars. The final selfie shows that the lander is covered with far more dust than it was in previous selfies from December 2018 and April 2019.

The lander went into safe mode on May 7, when its energy levels dropped, causing it to cease everything but essential functions. The team anticipates this could happen more frequently in the future as dust levels increase. The stationary lander is only able to collect about one-tenth of the available power supply it had after landing on Mars in November 2018. When InSight first landed, it could produce about 5,000 watt-hours each day on Mars, the equivalent of what it takes to power an electric oven for an hour and 40 minutes. Now, the lander produces 500 watt-hours per day, enough to power an electric oven for just 10 minutes. If 25% of the solar panels were cleaned, InSight would experience a power boost sufficient to keep it going. The spacecraft has witnessed many dust devils, or whirlwinds, but none have been close enough to clear off the solar panels. \"We've been hoping for a dust cleaning like we saw happen several times to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a statement. \"That's still possible, but energy is low enough that our focus is making the most of the science we can still collect.\" By the end of the summer, the team will turn off the seismometer, end science operations, and monitor what power levels remain on the lander. At the end of the year, the InSight mission will conclude. The InSight team, however, will still listen for any possible communication from the spacecraft and determine if it could ever operate again. The lander's highly sensitive seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, has detected more than 1,300 marsquakes from hundreds and thousands of miles away. InSight detected the largest one yet, a magnitude 5, on May 4. \"Even as we're starting to get close to the end of our mission, Mars is still giving us some really amazing things to see,\" Banerdt said. The data collected by InSight so far has revealed new details about the little-known Martian core, interior layers and crust. It has also recorded weather data and analyzed the remains of the magnetic field that once existed on Mars. InSight's steady stream of data heading to scientists on Earth will stop when the solar cells can no longer generate enough power. But researchers will be studying the detections made by InSight for decades to come in order to learn as much as possible about our enigmatic planetary neighbor.

InSight, a marsquake-seeking lander, alighted on the surface in 2018 on a bid to better understand the interior of Mars. While the data collected by the mission will be available forever, the spacecraft is winding down science activities to preserve power as best as possible.

Still, the agency says InSight will likely run too low on power later this year to conduct new science. But the mission's science value is signaled by the agency's extensions to its work; the lander's primary mission lasted one Martian year, or nearly two Earth years. InSight didn't include a secondary system to clean off dust, relying instead on passing dust devils or strong breezes to clean the lander. Engineers did manage to remove a bit of dust in 2021 by drizzling sand on the lander and allowing wind to blow that sand across the panel, however. With its likely final selfie accomplished, the lander will move its arm into a \"retirement pose,\" an inverted V-shape. The marsquake-tracking device will run for a little while longer, but is expected to be turned off late in the summer. That said, InSight might get lucky before that point. Its power may last a little longer than expected, or a passing breeze may finally push some of the dust away and allow the lander to squeak out a little more science later in the year. \"It's exceeded our expectations at just about every turn on Mars, and so it may actually last longer than that,\" Bruce Banerdt, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's principal investigator for the mission, told reporters during the May 17 press conference.

The InSight mission uncovered little or no sign of water or water ice in the nearly 1,000 feet below the lander, a new study shows. The subsurface around the landing zone - an equatorial site chosen especially for its flat terrain and good marsquake potential - appears loose and porous, with few ice grains in between gaps in the crust, researchers said. \"These findings don't preclude that there could be grains of ice or small balls of ice that are not cementing other minerals together,\" said study lead author and geophysicist Vashan Wright, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. \"The question is, How likely is ice to be present in that form?\" Wright said in a statement. Another possible indication of water is rocks cemented together below the landing area, but InSight hasn't found evidence of widespread cemented sediments, the statement added. InSight is located on Elysium Planitia, upon which the mission alighted in 2018 to look for marsquakes, or vibrations caused by interior activity or meteorites crashing into the Martian surface. The equatorial region where InSight is working, in theory, should be able to host subsurface water, as conditions are cold enough even there for water to freeze. But the new finding is challenging scientists' assumptions about possible ice or liquid water beneath the subsurface near InSight, whose job is to probe beneath the surface. While images from the surface have suggested there might be sedimentary rock and lava flows beneath InSight, researchers' models have uncertainties about porosity and mineral content. InSight is helping to fill in some of those gaps, and its new data suggests that \"uncemented material\" largely fills in the region blow the lander. That suggests little water is present, although more data needs to be collected. It's unclear how representative the InSight data is of the Martian subsurface in general, but more information may come courtesy of future missions. NASA is considering a Mars Life Explorer that would drill 6 feet below the surface to search for possible habitable conditions. Additionally, a proposed Mars Ice Mapper Mission could search for possible water reservoirs for human missions. A study based on the research was published Tuesday in Geophysical Research Letters.

The findings, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, describes the dry conditions in the top 300 metres of the subsurface beneath the landing site near the Martian equator. \"We find that Mars' crust is weak and porous. The sediments are not well- cemented. And there's no ice or not much ice filling the pore spaces,\" said geophysicist Vashan Wright of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. \"These findings don't preclude that there could be grains of ice or small balls of ice that are not cementing other minerals together,\" said Wright. \"The question is how likely is ice to be present in that form?\" Further, the team found that the red planet may have harboured oceans of water early in its history. Many experts suspected that much of the water became part of the minerals that make up underground cement. \"If you put water in contact with rocks, you produce a brand-new set of minerals, like clay, so the water's not a liquid. It's part of the mineral structure,\" said co-author Michael Manga of the University of California Berkeley. \"There is some cement, but the rocks are not full of cement.\" \"Water may also go into minerals that do not act as cement. But the uncemented subsurface removes one way to preserve a record of life or biological activity,\" Wright said. Cements by their very nature hold rocks and sediments together, protecting them from destructive erosion. The lack of cemented sediments suggests a water scarcity in the 300 metres below InSight's landing site near the equator. The below-freezing average temperature at the Mars equator means that conditions would be cold enough to freeze water if it were there. Many planetary scientists, including Manga, have long suspected that the Martian subsurface would be full of ice. Their suspicions have melted away. Still, big ice sheets and frozen ground ice remain at the Martian poles. \"As scientists, we're now confronted with the best data, the best observations. And our models predicted that there should still be frozen ground at that latitude with aquifers underneath,\" said Manga, professor and chair of Earth and planetary science at UC Berkeley. The InSight spacecraft landed on Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth, plain near the Martian equator, in 2018. Its instruments included a seismometer that measures vibrations caused by marsquakes and crashing meteorites. Scientists want to probe the subsurface because if life exists on Mars, that is where it would be. There is no liquid water on the surface, and subsurface life would be protected from radiation.

Next could come the 'Mars Life Explorer'", "date": "2022-08-18", "content": "Could life be hiding in ice under the surface of Mars? NASA's InSight mission is winding down, but a much more ambitious life-hunting lander bound for the red planet is already taking shape. It's the Mars Life Explorer, also known as MLE. This exciting new concept got a boost in April 2022 when it was prioritized by the U.S. National Academies Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey. Regarded by NASA as a \"to-do\" direct from the planetary science community, the report recommended that MLE should be the next medium-class mission in NASA's Mars Exploration Program (MEP). MLE is slated to cost $1.1 billion and could go to the red planet as early as 2033. It could help answer whether Mars' mid-latitudes have or recently had life in its near-surface ice by drilling deep into it. Should MLE become a reality, the search for life on Mars could be going underground. NASA's InSight lander is in its death throes after being on Elysium Planitia since Nov. 26, 2018. Since then, InSight has been using its seismometer to measure \"Marsquakes,\" but it's about to succumb to dust: the lander's pair of 2.2 meter-wide (7.2 foot-wide) solar panels are caked with the stuff and by May 2022 were producing less than a tenth of the power they did when InSight landed. InSight is expected to stop responding by Dec. 2022 at the latest. \"There are discussions about ways to modify the solar array so that you can do dust clearing,\" said Amy Williams, assistant professor, Geological Sciences at the University of Florida and \"science champion\" on the mission concept study for MLE. \"People are feeling more confident that we can engineer around that in the future.\" What is the Mars Life Explorer? We know there was once water on Mars. A lot of it. But as a planet, it's undergone profound climate change. Do any habitable environments remain? Are they inhabited? MLE should be able to explore these questions and more. A fixed landing platform launching in the early-to-late 2030s, it's a \"high heritage\" mission based on InSight and the Phoenix lander, which in 2008 confirmed the presence of water ice in Mars' polar regions. MLE would drill 2 meters (6.5 feet) into Mars looking for water ice to take samples and study them in situ. InSight's \"mole\" - its burrowing heat probe - was designed to take temperature measurements 3 meters (10 feet) beneath the Martian surface. \"Clumpy\" ground meant it couldn't get any deeper than just a few centimeters, so MLE will use Honeybee Robotics' The Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploration of New Terrains (TRIDENT) - a much larger rotary-hammer drill that will be tested on the Moon during the VIPER and PRIME-1 robotic missions in 2022 and 2023, respectively. TRIDENT will drill into the lowest latitude ice deposits on Mars. Why go underground? \"Mars' surface is pretty sterilizing to life as we know it, but just a few millimeters into the subsurface there's protection from UV radiation and meters down there's more protection from gamma radiation,\" said Williams. \"When the ice melts and you have liquid water present it can likely form a habitable environment if a couple other conditions are met.\" Even if the ice doesn't contain life itself it will contain a record of what happened to the Martian climate. MLE will also explore what's in the ice - such as organics, trace gasses, and isotopes - and explore its chemistry. It will also examine how the ice changes over a Martian year (687 Earth days). It might be tempting to think that by being merely a platform and not a rover like Perseverance or a drone like Ingenuity - and a much lower-cost mission - that MLE isn't as ambitious. But if successful, it could be a landmark moment in the search for life because it would be the first mission to look for life that exists right now. \"Perseverance looks in the ancient rock record at a time they were lakes, rivers, and hydrothermal systems,\" said Bethany Ehlmann, vice chair of the Decadal Survey Mars panel, member of MLE Steering Group, and president of The Planetary Society. \"The science of astrobiology has matured to the point that we can think about searching for modern habitats and modern life on Mars - and Mars Life Explorer is explicitly focused on modern habitability.\" Perseverance may have ancient Mars covered, but modern Mars is becoming more interesting. \"There's evidence for recent salt deposits, mid-latitude ices, trace gasses exchanging methane, volatiles exchanging water and gasses coming and going seasonally,\" said Ehlmann. \"Mars teeters right on the edge of habitability so the idea behind Mars Life Explorer is to investigate whether there are habitats on modern Mars.\" The mission must identify from orbit where to land in the mid-latitudes of Mars in a region where ground ice is accessible within a meter of the surface. Where MLE lands on Mars is everything, not only because it has to land where there is accessible ice close to the surface, but because its location will drastically affect light levels. \"The further north you go, the more likely you are to have water ice within one meter of the subsurface,\" said Williams. \"But you also can substantially impact your power and energy usage, so it's a balance.\" In the north it also gets colder for longer, which means more energy is needed to stay alive. \"The goal is for the prime mission to last for one Martian year,\" said Williams. \"We've got to make it through a winter.\" Mars is hard even for robots, which persuades astrobiologists that maybe if life exists on Mars it's often in a vegetative or spore state, perhaps reanimating itself when conditions allow. \"It might be right on the edge of what we expect life to be able to do,\" said Williams. \"If Martian life ever arose it will have evolved to thrive in what we consider to be an extreme environment.\" Landing somewhere with ice close to the surface is, of course, essential, but the mid-latitudes of Mars are seen as the sweet spot for the possible existence of life. \"If you do have episodic warming and melting of the ground ice you could have liquid water, which is vital for life as we know it as the universal solvent,\" said Williams. \"From an astrobiological perspective that might be enough to enable life, if it exists, to get liquid water when it needs it.\" One proposed landing zone for MLE is Arcadia Planitia, a dusty plain in mid-northern latitudes that is thought to have ice just below the surface. MLE could land on Mars in 2033, which is the same year NASA expects the Mars Sample Return mission to deliver the first rocks to Earth from the red planet. They could possibly contain traces of ancient extinct life on Mars. \"The Mars Exploration Program has searched for water, for organic carbon with Curiosity, and for extinct life with Perseverance,\" said Williams.

NASA leadership and mission team members will highlight InSight's science accomplishments, share details on the spacecraft's power situation, and discuss its future. InSight landed in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars in November 2018 with the goal of studying the planet's deep interior for the first time, using seismic signals to learn more about the properties of the crust, mantle, and core. Answering these questions helps shed light on how all rocky worlds form, including Earth and its Moon. After InSight met the goals of its two-year-long prime mission, NASA extended the mission until December 2022. However, due to dust accumulation on its solar panels, InSight's electrical power production is dropping, and the mission is unlikely to continue operations for the duration of its current extended mission unless its solar panels are cleared by a passing \"dust devil\" in Mars' atmosphere.

During its time on the Red Planet, InSight has achieved all its primary science goals and continues to hunt for quakes on Mars. The mission is the first to reveal the interior structure of Mars, using marsquakes to study the layers inside the planet. InSight's seismometer was the first to detect a quake on another planet. InSight also measured weather at Elysium Planitia for four years with a unique set of meteorological sensors. InSight has also persisted through adversity. The team found innovative ways to take on engineering challenges they encountered. InSight's findings help scientists understand how all rocky worlds, including Earth and its Moon, formed. Touchdown confirmed. InSight has been fantastically successful. We've gotten more science than we had ever dreamed that we would get during the course of this mission. Insight's primary goal was to better understand how the terrestrial planets, the rocky planets formed and evolved. First, we landed an incredibly sensitive seismometer on the surface of Mars, and with that we are able to record over 1300 Mars quakes. And these range all the way from tiny little temblors that just barely go over the noise background to a handful of quakes that were larger than magnitude four. And feeling those vibrations the scientists can actually take that information and use that to reconstruct all the material that those Mars quakes traveled through and thereby see the interior of the planet. We looked at its core, which is big and not very dense.We looked at its mantle, which is not so hot, and we looked at its crust, which is not too thick and not too dense compared to some of our permission expectations. By measuring the detailed structure of the inside of Mars, it gives us a snapshot of what the planet looked like. Four and a half billion years ago. The other thing that we've been able to do is make a very detailed record of the weather at Mars. But we have a really good weather station which has allowed meteorologists to study the weather at the at the Insight Landing site and relate that to the climate changes on Mars. What we didn't do, unfortunately, was make the heat flow measurement we wanted to make. Our heat flow probe was supposed to get 3 to 5 meters down,and we were unable to reach that depth. But we were able to get some of those measurements,such as the heat transfer among the soil. InSight is a solar powered mission. We have solar panels, and they were designed to give us enough power to easily get through the first two years. But there's a lot of dust in Mars's atmosphere, and that's falling down on top of our solar arrays and slowly blocking the sun. As the panels are getting dustier. We started wracking our brains of whether there's anything we can do to try to clean off those panels ourselves. When the idea of using dirt to clean the solar arrays was first proposed, it seemed counterintuitive. We were actually able to use the arm and the scoop to scoop up some soil from the ground and dump it over the lander, having some of that heavier sand blow onto the arrays and knock some of the dust off. So we essentially used it as an array cleaning tool. Cleaning with dirt actually worked! It allowed us to actually keep the instruments going during the low power season where the Mars is farthest from the sun during the winter. Unfortunately, later in the summer, we think that the power is going to be dropping so quickly due to the atmosphere getting dustier due to the alignment of Mars and the sun. We're going to be at a point where we can no longer have all of our instruments on, which means we'll be turning off the seismometer and other instruments on board.The last day is going to be bittersweet. Obviously, we're preparing for it. We know it's coming. But that first moment where we don't hear from the lander when we expect to, that's going to be tough. It's left a permanent mark on me and I literally tattooed InSight onto my arm. I'll never let it go. We've really rewritten sort of the chapter of the encyclopedia on the interior of Mars. That was our last big hole in our understanding of the planet. There's a lot of data that people are going to be looking at for decades to come.

The InSight lander is losing power because of all the dust on its solar panels. NASA said on May 17 that it will keep using the spacecraft's seismometer to register marsquakes until the power peters out, likely in July. Then flight controllers will monitor InSight until the end of this year, before calling everything off. \"There really hasn't been too much doom and gloom on the team. We're really still focused on operating the spacecraft,\" said Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Bruce Banerdt, the principal scientist. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has detected more than 1,300 marsquakes; the biggest one, a magnitude 5, occurred two weeks ago. It will be NASA's second Mars lander lost to dust: A global dust storm took out Opportunity in 2018. In InSight's case, it's been a gradual gathering of dust, especially over the past year. NASA's two other functioning spacecraft on the Martian surface - rovers Curiosity and Perseverance - are still going strong thanks to nuclear power. The space agency may rethink solar power in the future for Mars, said planetary science director Lori Glaze, or at least experiment with new panel- clearing tech or aim for the less-stormy seasons. InSight currently is generating one-tenth of the power from the sun than it did upon arrival. Deputy project manager Kathya Zamora Garcia said the lander initially had enough power to run an electric oven for one hour and 40 minutes; now it's down to 10 minutes max. The InSight team anticipated this much dust build-up but hoped a gust of wind or dust devil might clean off the solar panels. That has yet to happen, despite several thousand whirlwinds coming close. \"None of them have quite hit us dead-on yet enough to blow the dust off the panels,\" Banerdt told reporters. Another science instrument, dubbed the mole, was supposed to burrow 16 feet underground to measure the internal temperature of Mars. But the German digger never got deeper than a couple of feet because of the unexpected composition of the red dirt, and it finally was declared dead at the beginning of last year.

The lander will, however, leave behind a legacy of data that will be tapped by scientists around the world for years to come, helping to improve our understanding of planet formation, NASA said, while announcing on Tuesday the imminent end to InSight's science operations. Equipped with an ultra-sensitive seismometer, InSight recorded more than 1,300 \"marsquakes,\" including a magnitude 5 quake on May 4, the largest so far. But around July, the seismometer will be turned off. The lander's energy level will then be checked about once a day, and some pictures may still be taken. Then by the end of this year, the mission will be completely stopped. The cause: the accumulation over months of Martian dust on the lander's two solar panels, each measuring about 2.2 meters wide. InSight, which is already running on only a tenth of the energy it had at the beginning, will soon find its batteries drained. The speed at which dust accumulated corresponded more or less to what had been estimated by NASA. The lander got a new lease on life around a year ago, when its robotic arm was put to new and unplanned use to remove some dust from the solar panels, extending the mission. The maneuver - employed six times successfully - saw the arm use dust itself to clear the panels, as it scooped up some martian soil and gently dropped onto the robot so the dirt was blown across the solar panels, clearing parts of their surface. Adding something to the lander specifically to clean the panels was forgone due to costs, explained Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, during a press conference Tuesday. Such a mechanism would leave \"less to put into the science instruments,\" he said. InSight, one of four missions currently on the Red Planet - along with the US rovers Perseverance and Curiosity, and China's Zhurong - arrived on Mars in November 2018. Its seismometer, made in France, has since paved the way for great advances. \"The interior was kind of just a giant question mark,\" said Banerdt, who has worked on the InSight mission for more than a decade. But thanks to InSight, \"we've been able to map out the inside of Mars for the very first time in history.\" Seismic waves, varying based on the materials they pass through, offer a picture of the interior of the planet. For example, scientists were able to confirm that the core of Mars is liquid and to determine the thickness of the Martian crust - less dense than previously thought and likely consisting of three layers. The magnitude 5 quake in early May was much larger than all those previously recorded and close to what scientists thought would be the maximum on Mars, though it would not be considered a huge tremor on Earth. \"This quake is really going to be a treasure trove of scientific information when we get our teeth into it,\" Banerdt said. Earthquakes are in particular caused by plate tectonics, he explained. But, they can also be triggered when the Earth's crust moves due to temperature anomalies caused by its mantle. It is this type of vibration that scientists think they are dealing with on Mars. Not all of InSight's scientific operations have gone smoothly, however, such as when its heat probe had trouble being successfully buried below the surface to take the planet's temperature because of the composition of the soil where the robot landed. Regardless, in light of the seismometer's success, NASA is considering using the technique elsewhere in the future, said Lori Glaze, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. \"We'd really like to set up a complete network on the moon to really understand what's going on there.\" ", "url": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2022/05/19/2003778447"}, {"title": "InSight's Final Selfie - NASA's InSight Mars Lander", "date": "2022-05-23", "content": "NASA's InSight Mars lander took this final selfie on April 24, 2022, the 1,211th Martian day, or sol, of the mission.

And judging by the amount of dust coating the lander's solar panels, it's easy to see why. The stationary spacecraft captured the image on April 24 using its robotic arm, which will soon be placed into a final resting position called \"retirement pose\" this month. In order to take a selfie, the arm has to move several times, and that won't be possible anymore. \"Before losing more solar energy, I took some time to take in my surroundings and snapped my final selfie before I rest my arm and camera permanently in the stowed position,\" the InSight account tweeted on Tuesday. Due to a decreasing power supply, the mission will cease scientific operations by the end of late summer. It has been revealing the mysterious interior of Mars since landing in November 2018. InSight's solar panels have been increasingly covered in red Martian dust, despite creative efforts by the mission's team on Earth. This accumulation will only worsen as Mars now enters winter, when more dust is lofted into the atmosphere. These floating particles reduce the sunlight necessary to charge the solar panels that power InSight, which is currently working on an extended mission that was expected to last through December. The mission achieved its primary goals after its first two years on Mars. The final selfie shows that the lander is covered with far more dust than it was in previous selfies from December 2018 and April 2019.

The lander went into safe mode on May 7, when its energy levels dropped, causing it to cease everything but essential functions. The team anticipates this could happen more frequently in the future as dust levels increase. The stationary lander is only able to collect about one-tenth of the available power supply it had after landing on Mars in November 2018. When InSight first landed, it could produce about 5,000 watt-hours each day on Mars, the equivalent of what it takes to power an electric oven for an hour and 40 minutes. Now, the lander produces 500 watt-hours per day, enough to power an electric oven for just 10 minutes. If 25% of the solar panels were cleaned, InSight would experience a power boost sufficient to keep it going. The spacecraft has witnessed many dust devils, or whirlwinds, but none have been close enough to clear off the solar panels. \"We've been hoping for a dust cleaning like we saw happen several times to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a statement. \"That's still possible, but energy is low enough that our focus is making the most of the science we can still collect.\" By the end of the summer, the team will turn off the seismometer, end science operations, and monitor what power levels remain on the lander. At the end of the year, the InSight mission will conclude. The InSight team, however, will still listen for any possible communication from the spacecraft and determine if it could ever operate again. The lander's highly sensitive seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, has detected more than 1,300 marsquakes from hundreds and thousands of miles away. InSight detected the largest one yet, a magnitude 5, on May 4. \"Even as we're starting to get close to the end of our mission, Mars is still giving us some really amazing things to see,\" Banerdt said. The data collected by InSight so far has revealed new details about the little-known Martian core, interior layers and crust. It has also recorded weather data and analyzed the remains of the magnetic field that once existed on Mars. InSight's steady stream of data heading to scientists on Earth will stop when the solar cells can no longer generate enough power. But researchers will be studying the detections made by InSight for decades to come in order to learn as much as possible about our enigmatic planetary neighbor.

InSight, a marsquake-seeking lander, alighted on the surface in 2018 on a bid to better understand the interior of Mars. While the data collected by the mission will be available forever, the spacecraft is winding down science activities to preserve power as best as possible. The new image, released Monday, shows regolith all over InSight in a selfie taken on April 24, the 1,211th sol of the mission.

Still, the agency says InSight will likely run too low on power later this year to conduct new science. But the mission's science value is signaled by the agency's extensions to its work; the lander's primary mission lasted one Martian year, or nearly two Earth years. InSight didn't include a secondary system to clean off dust, relying instead on passing dust devils or strong breezes to clean the lander. Engineers did manage to remove a bit of dust in 2021 by drizzling sand on the lander and allowing wind to blow that sand across the panel, however. With its likely final selfie accomplished, the lander will move its arm into a \"retirement pose,\" an inverted V-shape. The marsquake-tracking device will run for a little while longer, but is expected to be turned off late in the summer. That said, InSight might get lucky before that point. Its power may last a little longer than expected, or a passing breeze may finally push some of the dust away and allow the lander to squeak out a little more science later in the year. \"It's exceeded our expectations at just about every turn on Mars, and so it may actually last longer than that,\" Bruce Banerdt, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's principal investigator for the mission, told reporters during the May 17 press conference.

The InSight mission uncovered little or no sign of water or water ice in the nearly 1,000 feet below the lander, a new study shows. The subsurface around the landing zone - an equatorial site chosen especially for its flat terrain and good marsquake potential - appears loose and porous, with few ice grains in between gaps in the crust, researchers said. \"These findings don't preclude that there could be grains of ice or small balls of ice that are not cementing other minerals together,\" said study lead author and geophysicist Vashan Wright, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. \"The question is, How likely is ice to be present in that form?\" Wright said in a statement. Another possible indication of water is rocks cemented together below the landing area, but InSight hasn't found evidence of widespread cemented sediments, the statement added. InSight is located on Elysium Planitia, upon which the mission alighted in 2018 to look for marsquakes, or vibrations caused by interior activity or meteorites crashing into the Martian surface. The equatorial region where InSight is working, in theory, should be able to host subsurface water, as conditions are cold enough even there for water to freeze. But the new finding is challenging scientists' assumptions about possible ice or liquid water beneath the subsurface near InSight, whose job is to probe beneath the surface. While images from the surface have suggested there might be sedimentary rock and lava flows beneath InSight, researchers' models have uncertainties about porosity and mineral content. InSight is helping to fill in some of those gaps, and its new data suggests that \"uncemented material\" largely fills in the region blow the lander. That suggests little water is present, although more data needs to be collected. It's unclear how representative the InSight data is of the Martian subsurface in general, but more information may come courtesy of future missions. NASA is considering a Mars Life Explorer that would drill 6 feet below the surface to search for possible habitable conditions. Additionally, a proposed Mars Ice Mapper Mission could search for possible water reservoirs for human missions. A study based on the research was published Tuesday in Geophysical Research Letters.

The findings, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, describes the dry conditions in the top 300 metres of the subsurface beneath the landing site near the Martian equator. \"We find that Mars' crust is weak and porous. The sediments are not well- cemented. And there's no ice or not much ice filling the pore spaces,\" said geophysicist Vashan Wright of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. \"These findings don't preclude that there could be grains of ice or small balls of ice that are not cementing other minerals together,\" said Wright. \"The question is how likely is ice to be present in that form?\" Further, the team found that the red planet may have harboured oceans of water early in its history. Many experts suspected that much of the water became part of the minerals that make up underground cement. \"If you put water in contact with rocks, you produce a brand-new set of minerals, like clay, so the water's not a liquid. It's part of the mineral structure,\" said co-author Michael Manga of the University of California Berkeley. \"There is some cement, but the rocks are not full of cement.\" \"Water may also go into minerals that do not act as cement. But the uncemented subsurface removes one way to preserve a record of life or biological activity,\" Wright said. Cements by their very nature hold rocks and sediments together, protecting them from destructive erosion. The lack of cemented sediments suggests a water scarcity in the 300 metres below InSight's landing site near the equator. The below-freezing average temperature at the Mars equator means that conditions would be cold enough to freeze water if it were there. Many planetary scientists, including Manga, have long suspected that the Martian subsurface would be full of ice. Their suspicions have melted away. Still, big ice sheets and frozen ground ice remain at the Martian poles. \"As scientists, we're now confronted with the best data, the best observations. And our models predicted that there should still be frozen ground at that latitude with aquifers underneath,\" said Manga, professor and chair of Earth and planetary science at UC Berkeley. The InSight spacecraft landed on Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth, plain near the Martian equator, in 2018. Its instruments included a seismometer that measures vibrations caused by marsquakes and crashing meteorites. Scientists want to probe the subsurface because if life exists on Mars, that is where it would be. There is no liquid water on the surface, and subsurface life would be protected from radiation.

Next could come the 'Mars Life Explorer'", "date": "2022-08-18", "content": "Could life be hiding in ice under the surface of Mars? NASA's InSight mission is winding down, but a much more ambitious life-hunting lander bound for the red planet is already taking shape. It's the Mars Life Explorer, also known as MLE. This exciting new concept got a boost in April 2022 when it was prioritized by the U.S. National Academies Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey. Regarded by NASA as a \"to-do\" direct from the planetary science community, the report recommended that MLE should be the next medium-class mission in NASA's Mars Exploration Program (MEP). MLE is slated to cost $1.1 billion and could go to the red planet as early as 2033. It could help answer whether Mars' mid-latitudes have or recently had life in its near-surface ice by drilling deep into it. Should MLE become a reality, the search for life on Mars could be going underground. NASA's InSight lander is in its death throes after being on Elysium Planitia since Nov. 26, 2018. Since then, InSight has been using its seismometer to measure \"Marsquakes,\" but it's about to succumb to dust: the lander's pair of 2.2 meter-wide (7.2 foot-wide) solar panels are caked with the stuff and by May 2022 were producing less than a tenth of the power they did when InSight landed. InSight is expected to stop responding by Dec. 2022 at the latest. \"There are discussions about ways to modify the solar array so that you can do dust clearing,\" said Amy Williams, assistant professor, Geological Sciences at the University of Florida and \"science champion\" on the mission concept study for MLE. \"People are feeling more confident that we can engineer around that in the future.\" What is the Mars Life Explorer? We know there was once water on Mars. A lot of it. But as a planet, it's undergone profound climate change. Do any habitable environments remain? Are they inhabited? MLE should be able to explore these questions and more. A fixed landing platform launching in the early-to-late 2030s, it's a \"high heritage\" mission based on InSight and the Phoenix lander, which in 2008 confirmed the presence of water ice in Mars' polar regions. MLE would drill 2 meters (6.5 feet) into Mars looking for water ice to take samples and study them in situ. InSight's \"mole\" - its burrowing heat probe - was designed to take temperature measurements 3 meters (10 feet) beneath the Martian surface. \"Clumpy\" ground meant it couldn't get any deeper than just a few centimeters, so MLE will use Honeybee Robotics' The Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploration of New Terrains (TRIDENT) - a much larger rotary-hammer drill that will be tested on the Moon during the VIPER and PRIME-1 robotic missions in 2022 and 2023, respectively. TRIDENT will drill into the lowest latitude ice deposits on Mars. Why go underground? \"Mars' surface is pretty sterilizing to life as we know it, but just a few millimeters into the subsurface there's protection from UV radiation and meters down there's more protection from gamma radiation,\" said Williams. \"When the ice melts and you have liquid water present it can likely form a habitable environment if a couple other conditions are met.\" Even if the ice doesn't contain life itself it will contain a record of what happened to the Martian climate. MLE will also explore what's in the ice - such as organics, trace gasses, and isotopes - and explore its chemistry. It will also examine how the ice changes over a Martian year (687 Earth days). It might be tempting to think that by being merely a platform and not a rover like Perseverance or a drone like Ingenuity - and a much lower-cost mission - that MLE isn't as ambitious. But if successful, it could be a landmark moment in the search for life because it would be the first mission to look for life that exists right now. \"Perseverance looks in the ancient rock record at a time they were lakes, rivers, and hydrothermal systems,\" said Bethany Ehlmann, vice chair of the Decadal Survey Mars panel, member of MLE Steering Group, and president of The Planetary Society. \"The science of astrobiology has matured to the point that we can think about searching for modern habitats and modern life on Mars - and Mars Life Explorer is explicitly focused on modern habitability.\" Perseverance may have ancient Mars covered, but modern Mars is becoming more interesting. \"There's evidence for recent salt deposits, mid-latitude ices, trace gasses exchanging methane, volatiles exchanging water and gasses coming and going seasonally,\" said Ehlmann. \"Mars teeters right on the edge of habitability so the idea behind Mars Life Explorer is to investigate whether there are habitats on modern Mars.\" The mission must identify from orbit where to land in the mid-latitudes of Mars in a region where ground ice is accessible within a meter of the surface. Where MLE lands on Mars is everything, not only because it has to land where there is accessible ice close to the surface, but because its location will drastically affect light levels. \"The further north you go, the more likely you are to have water ice within one meter of the subsurface,\" said Williams. \"But you also can substantially impact your power and energy usage, so it's a balance.\" In the north it also gets colder for longer, which means more energy is needed to stay alive. \"The goal is for the prime mission to last for one Martian year,\" said Williams. \"We've got to make it through a winter.\" Mars is hard even for robots, which persuades astrobiologists that maybe if life exists on Mars it's often in a vegetative or spore state, perhaps reanimating itself when conditions allow. \"It might be right on the edge of what we expect life to be able to do,\" said Williams. \"If Martian life ever arose it will have evolved to thrive in what we consider to be an extreme environment.\" Landing somewhere with ice close to the surface is, of course, essential, but the mid-latitudes of Mars are seen as the sweet spot for the possible existence of life. \"If you do have episodic warming and melting of the ground ice you could have liquid water, which is vital for life as we know it as the universal solvent,\" said Williams. \"From an astrobiological perspective that might be enough to enable life, if it exists, to get liquid water when it needs it.\" One proposed landing zone for MLE is Arcadia Planitia, a dusty plain in mid-northern latitudes that is thought to have ice just below the surface. MLE could land on Mars in 2033, which is the same year NASA expects the Mars Sample Return mission to deliver the first rocks to Earth from the red planet. They could possibly contain traces of ancient extinct life on Mars. \"The Mars Exploration Program has searched for water, for organic carbon with Curiosity, and for extinct life with Perseverance,\" said Williams. MLE seems the next logical step. If MLE teases out habitable conditions, 2033 could be a big year in the search for life beyond Earth.

The InSight mission uncovered little or no sign of water or water ice in the nearly 1,000 feet below the lander, a new study shows. The subsurface around the landing zone - an equatorial site chosen especially for its flat terrain and good marsquake potential - appears loose and porous, with few ice grains in between gaps in the crust, researchers said. \"These findings don't preclude that there could be grains of ice or small balls of ice that are not cementing other minerals together,\" said study lead author and geophysicist Vashan Wright, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. \"The question is, How likely is ice to be present in that form?\" Wright said in a statement. Another possible indication of water is rocks cemented together below the landing area, but InSight hasn't found evidence of widespread cemented sediments, the statement added. InSight is located on Elysium Planitia, upon which the mission alighted in 2018 to look for marsquakes, or vibrations caused by interior activity or meteorites crashing into the Martian surface. The equatorial region where InSight is working, in theory, should be able to host subsurface water, as conditions are cold enough even there for water to freeze. But the new finding is challenging scientists' assumptions about possible ice or liquid water beneath the subsurface near InSight, whose job is to probe beneath the surface. While images from the surface have suggested there might be sedimentary rock and lava flows beneath InSight, researchers' models have uncertainties about porosity and mineral content. InSight is helping to fill in some of those gaps, and its new data suggests that \"uncemented material\" largely fills in the region blow the lander. That suggests little water is present, although more data needs to be collected. It's unclear how representative the InSight data is of the Martian subsurface in general, but more information may come courtesy of future missions. NASA is considering a Mars Life Explorer that would drill 6 feet below the surface to search for possible habitable conditions. Additionally, a proposed Mars Ice Mapper Mission could search for possible water reservoirs for human missions. A study based on the research was published Tuesday in Geophysical Research Letters.

The findings, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, describes the dry conditions in the top 300 metres of the subsurface beneath the landing site near the Martian equator. \"We find that Mars' crust is weak and porous. The sediments are not well- cemented. And there's no ice or not much ice filling the pore spaces,\" said geophysicist Vashan Wright of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. \"These findings don't preclude that there could be grains of ice or small balls of ice that are not cementing other minerals together,\" said Wright. \"The question is how likely is ice to be present in that form?\" Further, the team found that the red planet may have harboured oceans of water early in its history. Many experts suspected that much of the water became part of the minerals that make up underground cement. \"If you put water in contact with rocks, you produce a brand-new set of minerals, like clay, so the water's not a liquid. It's part of the mineral structure,\" said co-author Michael Manga of the University of California Berkeley. \"There is some cement, but the rocks are not full of cement.\" \"Water may also go into minerals that do not act as cement. But the uncemented subsurface removes one way to preserve a record of life or biological activity,\" Wright said. Cements by their very nature hold rocks and sediments together, protecting them from destructive erosion. The lack of cemented sediments suggests a water scarcity in the 300 metres below InSight's landing site near the equator. The below-freezing average temperature at the Mars equator means that conditions would be cold enough to freeze water if it were there. Many planetary scientists, including Manga, have long suspected that the Martian subsurface would be full of ice. Their suspicions have melted away. Still, big ice sheets and frozen ground ice remain at the Martian poles. \"As scientists, we're now confronted with the best data, the best observations. And our models predicted that there should still be frozen ground at that latitude with aquifers underneath,\" said Manga, professor and chair of Earth and planetary science at UC Berkeley. The InSight spacecraft landed on Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth, plain near the Martian equator, in 2018. Its instruments included a seismometer that measures vibrations caused by marsquakes and crashing meteorites. Scientists want to probe the subsurface because if life exists on Mars, that is where it would be. There is no liquid water on the surface, and subsurface life would be protected from radiation. Following a sample-return mission, a NASA priority for the next decade is the Mars Life Explorer mission concept. The goal is to drill two metres into the Martian crust at high latitude to search for life where ice, rock, and the atmosphere come together.

Next could come the 'Mars Life Explorer'", "date": "2022-08-18", "content": "Could life be hiding in ice under the surface of Mars? NASA's InSight mission is winding down, but a much more ambitious life-hunting lander bound for the red planet is already taking shape. It's the Mars Life Explorer, also known as MLE. This exciting new concept got a boost in April 2022 when it was prioritized by the U.S. National Academies Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey. Regarded by NASA as a \"to-do\" direct from the planetary science community, the report recommended that MLE should be the next medium-class mission in NASA's Mars Exploration Program (MEP). MLE is slated to cost $1.1 billion and could go to the red planet as early as 2033. It could help answer whether Mars' mid-latitudes have or recently had life in its near-surface ice by drilling deep into it. Should MLE become a reality, the search for life on Mars could be going underground. NASA's InSight lander is in its death throes after being on Elysium Planitia since Nov. 26, 2018. Since then, InSight has been using its seismometer to measure \"Marsquakes,\" but it's about to succumb to dust: the lander's pair of 2.2 meter-wide (7.2 foot-wide) solar panels are caked with the stuff and by May 2022 were producing less than a tenth of the power they did when InSight landed. InSight is expected to stop responding by Dec. 2022 at the latest. \"There are discussions about ways to modify the solar array so that you can do dust clearing,\" said Amy Williams, assistant professor, Geological Sciences at the University of Florida and \"science champion\" on the mission concept study for MLE. \"People are feeling more confident that we can engineer around that in the future.\" What is the Mars Life Explorer? We know there was once water on Mars. A lot of it. But as a planet, it's undergone profound climate change. Do any habitable environments remain? Are they inhabited? MLE should be able to explore these questions and more. A fixed landing platform launching in the early-to-late 2030s, it's a \"high heritage\" mission based on InSight and the Phoenix lander, which in 2008 confirmed the presence of water ice in Mars' polar regions. MLE would drill 2 meters (6.5 feet) into Mars looking for water ice to take samples and study them in situ. InSight's \"mole\" - its burrowing heat probe - was designed to take temperature measurements 3 meters (10 feet) beneath the Martian surface. \"Clumpy\" ground meant it couldn't get any deeper than just a few centimeters, so MLE will use Honeybee Robotics' The Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploration of New Terrains (TRIDENT) - a much larger rotary-hammer drill that will be tested on the Moon during the VIPER and PRIME-1 robotic missions in 2022 and 2023, respectively. TRIDENT will drill into the lowest latitude ice deposits on Mars. Why go underground? \"Mars' surface is pretty sterilizing to life as we know it, but just a few millimeters into the subsurface there's protection from UV radiation and meters down there's more protection from gamma radiation,\" said Williams. \"When the ice melts and you have liquid water present it can likely form a habitable environment if a couple other conditions are met.\" Even if the ice doesn't contain life itself it will contain a record of what happened to the Martian climate. MLE will also explore what's in the ice - such as organics, trace gasses, and isotopes - and explore its chemistry. It will also examine how the ice changes over a Martian year (687 Earth days). It might be tempting to think that by being merely a platform and not a rover like Perseverance or a drone like Ingenuity - and a much lower-cost mission - that MLE isn't as ambitious.
