The observatory was shipped to Florida from the Lockheed Martin plant in Sunnyvale, Calif. The Space Infrared Telescope Facility marks the finale of NASA's Great Observatories program, which includes the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Its unprecedented infrared sensitivity will allow astronomers to capture what they affectionately call \"the Old, the Cold, and the Dirty,\" referring to the coldest, oldest, and most dust-obscured objects and processes in the universe. The observatory's amazing ability to sleuth around for low-temperature objects will also aid in the search for planetary systems in the making, some of which may breed Earth-like planets harboring life. The mission is a cornerstone of NASA's Origins Program, which seeks to answer the questions, \"Where did we come from? Are we alone?\" Final launch preparations for the mission will occur in NASA spacecraft Hangar AE, a \"class 10,000\" laminar flow clean room on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, where the telescope will spend approximately one month. Among the milestones that the mission must accomplish while there are a confidence test of the telescope's three instruments and the associated optics, which are part of the cryogenic telescope assembly; testing of the attitude and pointing control subsystem, which will then be filled with ultra-pure high pressure nitrogen gas; checkout of the power and communications systems; and an end-to-end communications test with the Deep Space Network of tracking stations. After final closeouts of the observatory, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility will be mated to the payload attach fitting and transported to the launch pad. Meanwhile, on Pad B at Launch Complex 17, the stacking of the Boeing Delta II launch vehicle began on Feb. 24 and was followed with the erection of the nine solid rocket boosters. The second stage is planned for hoisting atop the first stage on March 12. A flight simulation and a minus count with the vehicle loaded with liquid oxygen will occur the following week. The Space Infrared Telescope Facility is scheduled to arrive at Pad 17-B on April 2 and will spend approximately two weeks atop the Delta II Heavy launch vehicle. The payload fairing will be placed around the telescope on April 5. Then the observatory's dewar will be cryogenically topped off with super-cold liquid helium to its maximum capacity -- 360 liters (90 gallons) -- chilled to near absolute zero. This is used to cool the infrared detectors so that they can achieve the highest level of sensitivity to the infrared spectrum of light. This process of filling the spacecraft dewar will take approximately six days. Finally, two days before launch, the Delta launch vehicle's second stage will be fueled in advance for launch with its complement of storable hypergolic propellants. Launch is scheduled to occur on Tuesday, April 15, 2003, at 4:34:07 a.m. EDT.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2003-0-space-infrared-telescope-facility-arrives-at-ksc"}, {"title": "Space Infrared Telescope Facility Lifts Off", "date": "2003-08-25", "content": "NASA's Space Infrared Telescope Facility successfully launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 1:35:39 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (10:35:39 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, August 24) aboard a Delta II launch vehicle.

Jay Stidolph, a Canadian resident of Fort Nelson, British Columbia, submitted the winning entry. Spitzer (1914-1997) was the first to propose, in 1946, placing a large telescope in space to avoid the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere. He then devoted the next 50 years of his career to making this vision a reality. His efforts led to the Hubble Space Telescope and another successful NASA space telescope -- the Copernicus satellite. He also made significant contributions to the fields of stellar dynamics, the interstellar medium and plasma physics. Spitzer served on the faculty of Princeton University for 50 years. He received numerous awards, including the Catherine Wolfe Bruce gold medal (1973); the National Academy of Sciences' Henry Draper Medal; the first James Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics by the American Physical Society (1975); the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1978); the National Medal of Science (1979); and the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy (1985), the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for fields excluded from those awards. In addition to being an outstanding scientist, Spitzer was an exceptional teacher, well regarded by his colleagues and students.

Spitzer's state-of-the-art infrared detectors can sense the infrared radiation, or heat, from the farthest, coldest and dustiest objects in the universe. One such dusty object is the Tarantula Nebula. Located in the southern constellation of Dorado, in a nearby galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud, this glowing cloud of gas and dust is one of the most dynamic star-forming regions in our local group of galaxies.

The first observations, of a glowing stellar nursery; a swirling, dusty galaxy; a disc of planet-forming debris; and organic material in the distant universe, demonstrate the power of the telescope's infrared detectors to capture cosmic features never before seen. The Spitzer Space Telescope was also officially named today after the late Dr. Lyman Spitzer, Jr. He was one of the 20th century's most influential scientists, and in the mid-1940s, he first proposed placing telescopes in space. \"NASA's newest Great Observatory is open for business, and it is beginning to take its place at the forefront of science,\" said NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science, Dr. Ed Weiler. \"Like Hubble, Compton and Chandra, the new Spitzer Space Telescope will soon be making major discoveries, and, as these first images show, should excite the public with views of the cosmos like we've never had before.\" \"The Spitzer Space Telescope is working extremely well. The scientists who are starting to use it deeply appreciate the ingenuity and dedication of the thousands of people devoted to development and operations of the mission,\" said Dr. Michael Werner, project scientist for the Spitzer Space Telescope at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Launched Aug. 25 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., the Spitzer Space Telescope is the fourth of NASA's Great Observatories, a program designed to paint a more comprehensive picture of the cosmos using different wavelengths of light. While the other Great Observatories have probed the universe with visible light (Hubble Space Telescope), gamma rays (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) and X-rays (Chandra X-ray Observatory), the Spitzer Space Telescope observes the cosmos in the infrared. Spitzer's unprecedented sensitivity allows it to sense infrared radiation, or heat, from the most distant, cold and dust-obscured celestial objects. Today's initial images revealed the versatility of the telescope and its three science instruments. The images: -- Resembling a creature on the run with flames streaming behind it, the Spitzer image of a dark globule in the emission nebula IC 1396 is in spectacular contrast to the view seen in visible light.

It was named in honor of the late Dr. Lyman Spitzer Jr., one of the 20th century's most distinguished scientists. Spitzer's pioneering efforts to put telescopes in space led to two successful space missions, including the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA also released the Spitzer Space Telescope's first dazzling observations. \"The Spitzer Space Telescope takes its place at the forefront of astronomy in the 21st century, just as its namesake, Dr. Lyman Spitzer Jr., was at the forefront of astronomy in the 20th,\" said NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science Dr. Ed Weiler. The telescope was launched August 25, 2003, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla. Its state-of-the-art infrared detectors pierce the dense clouds of gas and dust that enshroud many celestial objects, including distant galaxies; clusters of stars in formation; and planet forming discs surrounding stars. It is the fourth of NASA's Great Observatories, a program that also includes the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The new name was chosen after an international contest sponsored by NASA. More than 7,000 names and supporting essays were submitted, with more than a third coming from outside the United States. Jay Stidolph, a Canadian resident of Fort Nelson, British Columbia, submitted the winning entry. Spitzer (1914-1997) was the first to propose, in 1946, placing a large telescope in space to avoid the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere. He then devoted the next 50 years of his career to making this vision a reality. His efforts led to the Hubble Space Telescope and another successful NASA space telescope -- the Copernicus satellite. He also made significant contributions to the fields of stellar dynamics, the interstellar medium and plasma physics. Spitzer served on the faculty of Princeton University for 50 years. He received numerous awards, including the Catherine Wolfe Bruce gold medal (1973); the National Academy of Sciences' Henry Draper Medal; the first James Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics by the American Physical Society (1975); the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1978); the National Medal of Science (1979); and the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy (1985), the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for fields excluded from those awards. In addition to being an outstanding scientist, Spitzer was an exceptional teacher, well regarded by his colleagues and students. He authored two popular reference books: Physics of Fully Ionized Gases and Diffuse Matter in Space. Considered to be a man of incredible discipline, diligence and politeness, Spitzer also loved to mountain-climb and ski. He was a member of the American Alpine Club. His wife, Doreen Canaday Spitzer, four children and 10 grandchildren survive him.

The findings were presented today at the American Astronomical Society annual meeting in Denver, Colo. A stunning image of the galaxy and its bizarre dust structure can be found at www.spitzer.caltech.edu. While previous observations with other telescopes have revealed this galactic remnant, it appeared as one long and irregular bar of dust. Spitzer's uniquely sensitive infrared eyes allowed the telescope to see clearly this strangely geometric structure for the first time. \"Now we can actually see the shape of this structure, which helps us explain how it arose,\" said Dr. Jocelyn Keene, principal investigator for the new research and an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, both in Pasadena, Calif. Located 11 million light-years away, Centaurus A is a type of galaxy known as \"elliptical.\" It is one of the brightest sources of radio waves in the sky, which suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole at its center. About 200 million years ago, this galaxy is believed to have consumed a smaller spiral galaxy -- the contents of which appear to be churning inside Centaurus A's core, triggering new generations of star birth. Resolving this unusual parallelogram structure has helped astronomers finally put together a picture of its history. The geometric shape can be explained using a model that describes a flat spiral galaxy falling into an elliptical galaxy and becoming twisted and warped in the process. The folds in the warped disc, when viewed nearly edge on, take on the appearance of a parallelogram. The model predicts that the leftover galaxy will ultimately flatten into a plane before being entirely devoured by Centaurus A. Warped discs like this are the \"smoking guns\" of galactic cannibalism, providing proof that one galaxy once made a meal of another. Such galactic feeding has long thought to be a mechanism by which giant elliptical galaxies form and grow, and likely provides the fuel that drives the strong radio activity surrounding Centaurus A's central black hole.

Dr. Mark Dickinson, of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, Tucson, Ariz., principal investigator for the new observations, said, \"With these ultra-deep Spitzer images, we are easily seeing objects throughout time and space, where the most distant known galaxies lie. Moreover, we see some objects that are completely invisible, but whose existence was hinted at by previous observations from the Chandra and Hubble Observatories.\" Seven of the objects detected by Spitzer may be part of the long-sought population of \"missing\" supermassive black holes that powered the bright cores of the earliest active galaxies. The discovery completes a full accounting of all the X-ray sources seen in one of the deepest surveys of the universe ever taken. This detective story required the combined power of NASA's three Great Observatories -- the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescope. Each observatory studies different wavelengths, from high-energy X-rays with Chandra, through visible light with Hubble, and into the infrared with Spitzer. Together, these telescopes yield far more information than any single instrument. All three telescopes looked as far as 13 billion light-years away, toward a small patch of the southern sky containing more than 10,000 galaxies, in a coordinated project called the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). Chandra images detected more than 200 X-ray sources believed to be supermassive black holes in the centers of young galaxies. Extremely hot interstellar gases falling into the black holes produce the X-rays. Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys revealed optical galaxies around almost all the X-ray black holes. However, seven mysterious X-ray sources remained for which there was no optical galaxy. Dr. Anton Koekemoer of the Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, Md., discovered these sources and has three intriguing possibilities for their origin: \"The galaxies around these black holes may be completely hidden by thick clouds of dust absorbing all their light, or may contain very old, red stars. Or some could be the most distant black holes ever observed -- perhaps as far as 13 billion light-years.\" If so, all their optical light would be shifted to very long infrared wavelengths by expansion of the universe. Scientists eagerly awaited the Spitzer images to solve this puzzle. Because Spitzer observes at infrared wavelengths up to 100 times longer than those probed by Hubble, Spitzer might be able to see the otherwise invisible objects. Indeed, the very first Spitzer images of these objects, obtained earlier this year, immediately revealed the telltale infrared glow from the host galaxies around all the missing X-ray black holes. Three of Koekemoer's galaxies are extremely \"red,\" or bright, in infrared. The Spitzer data, together with new images at shorter infrared wavelengths from the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory, indicate that the galaxies around these black holes could be heavily obscured by dust, and perhaps more distant than other known dust-obscured galaxies. Some of the other objects, however, have quite different colors, and are even more intriguing. \"Their colors may be consistent with objects more distant than any now known,\" said Dickinson, who cautioned that additional Spitzer observations later this year will help confirm what kind of objects these might be. Old Galaxies Shine in Infrared: In another study using the same Spitzer data, Dr. Haojing Yan of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif., studied 17 unusual galaxies near the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. This small patch of sky within the GOODS area was recently the target for the deepest optical images ever taken with Hubble's Advanced Camera. The Deep Field optical images, released in March 2004, reach more than five times fainter than the GOODS Hubble data. But even with that phenomenal sensitivity, two of the 17 Spitzer-selected objects remain completely invisible in optical light, while the others are only faintly detected. Yan finds that these galaxies get steadily brighter at longer wavelengths, and seem to be more distant cousins of the so-called \"Extremely Red Objects,\" known from previous deep surveys. Most are distant galaxies that are red because they are either old or dusty. These new Spitzer-identified objects, however, appear to lie farther away to a time when the universe was only two billion years old. \"These objects could be the remnants of the first stars -- the very first galaxies formed in the earliest stages of the universe,\" said Yan. Most galaxies that we see today formed their stars gradually over a long period of time. But these 17 objects seem to be \"old before their time,\" perhaps almost as old as the universe itself at that early epoch. \"If we indeed are seeing the direct, 'pure' descendants of the first stars, this would make a thrilling story,\" says Yan. Further Spitzer observations at longer wavelengths, planned for later this year, should help decide whether these objects are red because they are old, or because they are young and actively forming stars enveloped in dust. Black Holes In Hiding: Using Hubble and Chandra data, Dr. Meg Urry, a GOODS astronomer at Yale University, New Haven, Conn., and her team suggest that most accreting black holes are hidden at visible wavelengths, even in the early universe. Few such hidden black holes had previously been found at such large distances, despite theoretical arguments for their existence. They were missed because their visible radiation is so dim they look like faint, ordinary galaxies. \"With the new Spitzer data these very luminous, distant objects are easily visible,\" said Urry. \"The great sensitivity of the new Spitzer infrared cameras, combined with the superb spatial resolution of Chandra, means that finding all of the black holes that are powered by infalling gas is now possible.\" Urry's team is using data from the three space observatories to take a census of the supermassive black holes that formed two to five billion years after the big bang. Most of these active galactic nuclei are hidden by dust, which absorbs visible and some X-ray light but emits strongly at infrared wavelengths. \"The Spitzer GOODS observations verify that large numbers -- perhaps three-quarters -- of the obscured active galactic nuclei were indeed present in the early universe. The longer-wavelength Spitzer data still to come will reveal even more shrouded active galactic nuclei,\" said Urry, \"including some, missed by X-ray observations, which look like ultraluminous infrared galaxies.\"", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2004-10-spitzer-leads-nasas-great-observatories-to-uncover-black-holes-other-hidden-objects"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Spitzer Telescope Sends Rose for Valentine's Day", "date": "2004-02-12", "content": "Out of the dark and dusty cosmos comes an unusual valentine -- a stellar nursery resembling a shimmering pink rosebud.

Indeed, the very first Spitzer images of these objects, obtained earlier this year, immediately revealed the telltale infrared glow from the host galaxies around all the missing X-ray black holes. Three of Koekemoer's galaxies are extremely \"red,\" or bright, in infrared. The Spitzer data, together with new images at shorter infrared wavelengths from the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory, indicate that the galaxies around these black holes could be heavily obscured by dust, and perhaps more distant than other known dust-obscured galaxies. Some of the other objects, however, have quite different colors, and are even more intriguing. \"Their colors may be consistent with objects more distant than any now known,\" said Dickinson, who cautioned that additional Spitzer observations later this year will help confirm what kind of objects these might be. Old Galaxies Shine in Infrared: In another study using the same Spitzer data, Dr. Haojing Yan of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif., studied 17 unusual galaxies near the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. This small patch of sky within the GOODS area was recently the target for the deepest optical images ever taken with Hubble's Advanced Camera. The Deep Field optical images, released in March 2004, reach more than five times fainter than the GOODS Hubble data. But even with that phenomenal sensitivity, two of the 17 Spitzer-selected objects remain completely invisible in optical light, while the others are only faintly detected. Yan finds that these galaxies get steadily brighter at longer wavelengths, and seem to be more distant cousins of the so-called \"Extremely Red Objects,\" known from previous deep surveys. Most are distant galaxies that are red because they are either old or dusty. These new Spitzer-identified objects, however, appear to lie farther away to a time when the universe was only two billion years old. \"These objects could be the remnants of the first stars -- the very first galaxies formed in the earliest stages of the universe,\" said Yan. Most galaxies that we see today formed their stars gradually over a long period of time. But these 17 objects seem to be \"old before their time,\" perhaps almost as old as the universe itself at that early epoch. \"If we indeed are seeing the direct, 'pure' descendants of the first stars, this would make a thrilling story,\" says Yan. Further Spitzer observations at longer wavelengths, planned for later this year, should help decide whether these objects are red because they are old, or because they are young and actively forming stars enveloped in dust. Black Holes In Hiding: Using Hubble and Chandra data, Dr. Meg Urry, a GOODS astronomer at Yale University, New Haven, Conn., and her team suggest that most accreting black holes are hidden at visible wavelengths, even in the early universe. Few such hidden black holes had previously been found at such large distances, despite theoretical arguments for their existence. They were missed because their visible radiation is so dim they look like faint, ordinary galaxies. \"With the new Spitzer data these very luminous, distant objects are easily visible,\" said Urry. \"The great sensitivity of the new Spitzer infrared cameras, combined with the superb spatial resolution of Chandra, means that finding all of the black holes that are powered by infalling gas is now possible.\" Urry's team is using data from the three space observatories to take a census of the supermassive black holes that formed two to five billion years after the big bang. Most of these active galactic nuclei are hidden by dust, which absorbs visible and some X-ray light but emits strongly at infrared wavelengths. \"The Spitzer GOODS observations verify that large numbers -- perhaps three-quarters -- of the obscured active galactic nuclei were indeed present in the early universe. The longer-wavelength Spitzer data still to come will reveal even more shrouded active galactic nuclei,\" said Urry, \"including some, missed by X-ray observations, which look like ultraluminous infrared galaxies.\"", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2004-10-spitzer-leads-nasas-great-observatories-to-uncover-black-holes-other-hidden-objects"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Spitzer Spies Parallelogram-Shaped Galactic Meal", "date": "2004-06-01", "content": "Peering into the \"gut\" of the galaxy Centaurus A, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has captured in unprecedented detail this massive galaxy's last big meal: a spiral galaxy twisted into a parallelogram-shaped structure of dust.

About 200 million years ago, this galaxy is believed to have consumed a smaller spiral galaxy -- the contents of which appear to be churning inside Centaurus A's core, triggering new generations of star birth. Resolving this unusual parallelogram structure has helped astronomers finally put together a picture of its history. The geometric shape can be explained using a model that describes a flat spiral galaxy falling into an elliptical galaxy and becoming twisted and warped in the process. The folds in the warped disc, when viewed nearly edge on, take on the appearance of a parallelogram.

When a star like our own Sun begins to run out of fuel, its core shrinks and heats up, boiling off the star's outer layers. Leftover material shoots outward, expanding in shells around the star. This ejected material is then bombarded with ultraviolet light from the central star's fiery surface, producing huge, glowing clouds -- planetary nebulas -- that look like giant jellyfish in space. These cosmic beauties last a relatively brief time, about a few thousand years, in the approximately 10-billion-year lifetime of a star. The name \"planetary nebula\" came from early astronomers who thought the rounded clouds looked like planets. NGC 246 is located 1,800 light-years away in the Cetus constellation of our galaxy. Previous observations of this object by visible-light telescopes showed a glistening orb of gas and dust surrounding a central, compact star. By cutting through the envelope of dust with its infrared eyes, Spitzer provides a more transparent view through and behind the nebula. \"What we have seen with Spitzer is totally unexpected,\" said Hora. \"Although previous observations showed the nebula had a patchy appearance, Spitzer has revealed a ring component of this dying star, possibly consisting of hydrogen molecules.\" In the new false-color picture, the ring appears clumpy and red and off-center from the central star, while fluorescent, or ionized, gases are green.

The colliding galaxies, called the Antennae galaxies, are in the process of merging together. As they churn into each other, they throw off massive streamers of stars and dark clouds of dust. Spitzer's heat-seeking eyes peered through that dust and found a hidden population of newborn stars. The new Spitzer image is reported in one of 86 Spitzer papers published in the September issue of The Astrophysical Journal Supplement. This special all-Spitzer issue comes just after the one-year anniversary of the observatory's launch, and testifies to its tremendously successful first year in space. \"This abundance of Spitzer papers just one year after launch shows that the telescope is truly providing a new window on the universe,\" said Dr. Michael Werner, project scientist for Spitzer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"These papers report the earliest results, so the best is yet to come.\" In the latest Antennae galaxies study, led by Dr. Zhong Wang of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass., Spitzer uncovered a new generation of stars at the site where the two galaxies clash. The Antennae galaxies are a classic example of a galactic merger in action. These two spiral galaxies, located 68 million light-years away from Earth, began falling into each other around a common center of gravity about 800 million years ago. As they continue to crash together, clouds of gas are shocked and compressed in a process thought to trigger the birth of new stars. Astronomers believe that the two galaxies will ultimately merge into one spheroidal-shaped galaxy, leaving only hints of their varied pasts. Galactic mergers are common throughout the universe and play a key role in determining how galaxies grow and evolve. Our own Milky Way galaxy, for example, will eventually collide with our closest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. Previous images of the Antennae taken by visible-light telescopes show striking views of the swirling duo, with bright pockets of young stars dotting the spiral arms. At the center of the galaxies, however, where the two overlap, only a dark cloud of dust can be seen. In the new false-color Spitzer image, which has been combined with an image from a ground-based, visible-light telescope to highlight new features, this cloud of buried stars appears bright red. The visible-light information, on the other hand, is colored blue and indicates regions containing older stars. The nuclei, or centers, of the two galaxies are white. \"This more complete picture of star-formation in the Antennae will help us better understand the evolution of colliding galaxies, and the eventual fate of our own,\" said Dr. Giovanni Fazio, a co-author of the research and an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\" Fazio is principal investigator for the infrared array camera on Spitzer, which captured the new Antennae image.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2004-14-spitzer-arrives-at-scene-of-galactic-collision"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Spitzer Spies Parallelogram-Shaped Galactic Meal", "date": "2004-06-01", "content": "Peering into the \"gut\" of the galaxy Centaurus A, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has captured in unprecedented detail this massive galaxy's last big meal: a spiral galaxy twisted into a parallelogram-shaped structure of dust.

Dr. Mark Dickinson, of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, Tucson, Ariz., principal investigator for the new observations, said, \"With these ultra-deep Spitzer images, we are easily seeing objects throughout time and space, where the most distant known galaxies lie. Moreover, we see some objects that are completely invisible, but whose existence was hinted at by previous observations from the Chandra and Hubble Observatories.\" Seven of the objects detected by Spitzer may be part of the long-sought population of \"missing\" supermassive black holes that powered the bright cores of the earliest active galaxies. The discovery completes a full accounting of all the X-ray sources seen in one of the deepest surveys of the universe ever taken. This detective story required the combined power of NASA's three Great Observatories -- the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescope. Each observatory studies different wavelengths, from high-energy X-rays with Chandra, through visible light with Hubble, and into the infrared with Spitzer. Together, these telescopes yield far more information than any single instrument. All three telescopes looked as far as 13 billion light-years away, toward a small patch of the southern sky containing more than 10,000 galaxies, in a coordinated project called the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). Chandra images detected more than 200 X-ray sources believed to be supermassive black holes in the centers of young galaxies. Extremely hot interstellar gases falling into the black holes produce the X-rays. Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys revealed optical galaxies around almost all the X-ray black holes. However, seven mysterious X-ray sources remained for which there was no optical galaxy. Dr. Anton Koekemoer of the Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, Md., discovered these sources and has three intriguing possibilities for their origin: \"The galaxies around these black holes may be completely hidden by thick clouds of dust absorbing all their light, or may contain very old, red stars. Or some could be the most distant black holes ever observed -- perhaps as far as 13 billion light-years.\" If so, all their optical light would be shifted to very long infrared wavelengths by expansion of the universe. Scientists eagerly awaited the Spitzer images to solve this puzzle. Because Spitzer observes at infrared wavelengths up to 100 times longer than those probed by Hubble, Spitzer might be able to see the otherwise invisible objects. Indeed, the very first Spitzer images of these objects, obtained earlier this year, immediately revealed the telltale infrared glow from the host galaxies around all the missing X-ray black holes. Three of Koekemoer's galaxies are extremely \"red,\" or bright, in infrared. The Spitzer data, together with new images at shorter infrared wavelengths from the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory, indicate that the galaxies around these black holes could be heavily obscured by dust, and perhaps more distant than other known dust-obscured galaxies. Some of the other objects, however, have quite different colors, and are even more intriguing. \"Their colors may be consistent with objects more distant than any now known,\" said Dickinson, who cautioned that additional Spitzer observations later this year will help confirm what kind of objects these might be. Old Galaxies Shine in Infrared: In another study using the same Spitzer data, Dr. Haojing Yan of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif., studied 17 unusual galaxies near the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. This small patch of sky within the GOODS area was recently the target for the deepest optical images ever taken with Hubble's Advanced Camera. The Deep Field optical images, released in March 2004, reach more than five times fainter than the GOODS Hubble data. But even with that phenomenal sensitivity, two of the 17 Spitzer-selected objects remain completely invisible in optical light, while the others are only faintly detected. Yan finds that these galaxies get steadily brighter at longer wavelengths, and seem to be more distant cousins of the so-called \"Extremely Red Objects,\" known from previous deep surveys. Most are distant galaxies that are red because they are either old or dusty. These new Spitzer-identified objects, however, appear to lie farther away to a time when the universe was only two billion years old. \"These objects could be the remnants of the first stars -- the very first galaxies formed in the earliest stages of the universe,\" said Yan. Most galaxies that we see today formed their stars gradually over a long period of time. But these 17 objects seem to be \"old before their time,\" perhaps almost as old as the universe itself at that early epoch. \"If we indeed are seeing the direct, 'pure' descendants of the first stars, this would make a thrilling story,\" says Yan. Further Spitzer observations at longer wavelengths, planned for later this year, should help decide whether these objects are red because they are old, or because they are young and actively forming stars enveloped in dust. Black Holes In Hiding: Using Hubble and Chandra data, Dr. Meg Urry, a GOODS astronomer at Yale University, New Haven, Conn., and her team suggest that most accreting black holes are hidden at visible wavelengths, even in the early universe. Few such hidden black holes had previously been found at such large distances, despite theoretical arguments for their existence. They were missed because their visible radiation is so dim they look like faint, ordinary galaxies. \"With the new Spitzer data these very luminous, distant objects are easily visible,\" said Urry. \"The great sensitivity of the new Spitzer infrared cameras, combined with the superb spatial resolution of Chandra, means that finding all of the black holes that are powered by infalling gas is now possible.\" Urry's team is using data from the three space observatories to take a census of the supermassive black holes that formed two to five billion years after the big bang. Most of these active galactic nuclei are hidden by dust, which absorbs visible and some X-ray light but emits strongly at infrared wavelengths. \"The Spitzer GOODS observations verify that large numbers -- perhaps three-quarters -- of the obscured active galactic nuclei were indeed present in the early universe. The longer-wavelength Spitzer data still to come will reveal even more shrouded active galactic nuclei,\" said Urry, \"including some, missed by X-ray observations, which look like ultraluminous infrared galaxies.\"", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2004-10-spitzer-leads-nasas-great-observatories-to-uncover-black-holes-other-hidden-objects"}, {"title": "Dying Star Goes Out With a Ring", "date": "2004-08-09", "content": "A new image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope shows the shimmering embers of a dying star, and in their midst a mysterious doughnut-shaped ring. \"Spitzer's infrared vision has revealed what could not be seen before - a massive ring of material that was expelled from the dying star,\" said Dr. Joseph Hora, a Spitzer scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass. \"The composition of the ring and how it formed are mysteries we hope to address with further Spitzer studies.\" The dying star is part of a \"planetary nebula\" called NGC 246. When a star like our own Sun begins to run out of fuel, its core shrinks and heats up, boiling off the star's outer layers. Leftover material shoots outward, expanding in shells around the star. This ejected material is then bombarded with ultraviolet light from the central star's fiery surface, producing huge, glowing clouds -- planetary nebulas -- that look like giant jellyfish in space. These cosmic beauties last a relatively brief time, about a few thousand years, in the approximately 10-billion-year lifetime of a star. The name \"planetary nebula\" came from early astronomers who thought the rounded clouds looked like planets. NGC 246 is located 1,800 light-years away in the Cetus constellation of our galaxy. Previous observations of this object by visible-light telescopes showed a glistening orb of gas and dust surrounding a central, compact star. By cutting through the envelope of dust with its infrared eyes, Spitzer provides a more transparent view through and behind the nebula. \"What we have seen with Spitzer is totally unexpected,\" said Hora. \"Although previous observations showed the nebula had a patchy appearance, Spitzer has revealed a ring component of this dying star, possibly consisting of hydrogen molecules.\" In the new false-color picture, the ring appears clumpy and red and off-center from the central star, while fluorescent, or ionized, gases are green. The central star is the left white spot in the middle of the cloud. Ultimately, these data will help astronomers better understand how planetary nebulas take shape, and how they nourish new generations of stars.

The colliding galaxies, called the Antennae galaxies, are in the process of merging together. As they churn into each other, they throw off massive streamers of stars and dark clouds of dust. Spitzer's heat-seeking eyes peered through that dust and found a hidden population of newborn stars. The new Spitzer image is reported in one of 86 Spitzer papers published in the September issue of The Astrophysical Journal Supplement. This special all-Spitzer issue comes just after the one-year anniversary of the observatory's launch, and testifies to its tremendously successful first year in space. \"This abundance of Spitzer papers just one year after launch shows that the telescope is truly providing a new window on the universe,\" said Dr. Michael Werner, project scientist for Spitzer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"These papers report the earliest results, so the best is yet to come.\" In the latest Antennae galaxies study, led by Dr. Zhong Wang of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass., Spitzer uncovered a new generation of stars at the site where the two galaxies clash. The Antennae galaxies are a classic example of a galactic merger in action. These two spiral galaxies, located 68 million light-years away from Earth, began falling into each other around a common center of gravity about 800 million years ago. As they continue to crash together, clouds of gas are shocked and compressed in a process thought to trigger the birth of new stars. Astronomers believe that the two galaxies will ultimately merge into one spheroidal-shaped galaxy, leaving only hints of their varied pasts. Galactic mergers are common throughout the universe and play a key role in determining how galaxies grow and evolve. Our own Milky Way galaxy, for example, will eventually collide with our closest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. Previous images of the Antennae taken by visible-light telescopes show striking views of the swirling duo, with bright pockets of young stars dotting the spiral arms. At the center of the galaxies, however, where the two overlap, only a dark cloud of dust can be seen. In the new false-color Spitzer image, which has been combined with an image from a ground-based, visible-light telescope to highlight new features, this cloud of buried stars appears bright red. The visible-light information, on the other hand, is colored blue and indicates regions containing older stars. The nuclei, or centers, of the two galaxies are white. \"This more complete picture of star-formation in the Antennae will help us better understand the evolution of colliding galaxies, and the eventual fate of our own,\" said Dr. Giovanni Fazio, a co-author of the research and an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\" Fazio is principal investigator for the infrared array camera on Spitzer, which captured the new Antennae image.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2004-14-spitzer-arrives-at-scene-of-galactic-collision"}, {"title": "Spitzer Sees Ice and Warm Glows in Dark and Dusty Places", "date": "2004-11-09", "content": "Two new results from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope released today are helping astronomers better understand how stars form out of thick clouds of gas and dust, and how the molecules in those clouds ultimately become planets. Two discoveries -- the detection of an oddly dim object inside what was thought to be an empty cloud, and the discovery of icy planetary building blocks in a system believed to resemble our own solar system in its infancy -- were presented today at the first Spitzer science conference in Pasadena, Calif. Since Spitzer science observations began less than one year ago, the infrared capabilities of the space observatory have unveiled hundreds of space objects too dim, cool or distant to be seen with other telescopes. In one discovery, astronomers have detected a faint, star-like object in the least expected of places -- a \"starless core.\" Named for their apparent lack of stars, starless cores are dense knots of gas and dust that should eventually form individual newborn stars. Using Spitzer's infrared eyes, a team of astronomers led by Dr. Neal Evans of the University of Texas at Austin probed dozens of these dusty cores to gain insight into conditions that are needed for stars to form. Starless cores are fascinating to study because they tell us what conditions exist in the instants before a star forms. Understanding this environment is key to improving our theories of star formation, said Evans. But when they looked into one core, called L1014, they found a surprise -- a warm glow coming from a star-like object. The object defies all models of star formation; it is fainter than would be expected for a young star. Astronomers theorize that the mystery object is one of three possibilities: the youngest \"failed star,\" or brown dwarf ever detected; a newborn star caught in a very early stage of development; or something else entirely. This object might represent a different way of forming stars or brown dwarfs. Objects like this are so dim that previous studies would have missed them. It might be like a stealth version of star formation, Evans said. The new object is located 600 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. In another discovery, Spitzer's infrared eyes have peered into the place where planets are born -- the center of a dusty disc surrounding an infant star -- and spied the icy ingredients of planets and comets. This is the first definitive detection of ices in planet-forming discs. This disc resembles closely how we imagine our own solar system looked when it was only a few hundred thousand years old. It has the right size, and the central star is small and probably stable enough to support a water-rich planetary system for billions of years into the future, said Dr. Klaus Pontoppidan of Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, who led the team that made this discovery. Previously, astronomers had seen ices, or ice-coated dust particles, in the large cocoons of gas and dust that envelop young stars. But they were not able to distinguish these ices from those in the inner planet-forming portion of a star's disc. Using Spitzer's ultra-sensitive infrared vision and a clever trick, Pontoppidan and his colleagues were able to overcome this challenge. Their trick was to view a young star and its dusty disc at \"dawn.\" Discs can be viewed from a variety of angles, ranging from the side or edge-on, where the discs appear as dark bars, to face-on, where the discs become washed out by the light of the central star. They found that if they observed a disc at a 20-degree angle, at a position where the star peeks out like our Sun at dawn, they could see the ices. \"We hit the sweet spot,\" said Pontoppidan. \"Our models predicted that the search for ices in discs is a problem of finding an object with just the right viewing angle, and Spitzer confirmed that model.\" In this system, astronomers found ammonium ions as well as components of water and carbon dioxide ice.

Spitzer has discovered for the first time dusty discs around mature, Sun-like stars known to have planets. Hubble captured the most detailed image ever of a brighter disc circling a much younger Sun-like star. The findings offer \"snapshots\" of the process by which our own solar system evolved, from its dusty and chaotic beginnings to its more settled present-day state. \"Young stars have huge reservoirs of planet-building materials, while older ones have only leftover piles of rubble. Hubble saw the reservoirs and Spitzer, the rubble,\" said Dr. Charles Beichman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. He is lead author of the Spitzer study. \"This demonstrates how the two telescopes complement each other,\" he added. The young star observed by Hubble is 50 million to 250 million years old. This is old enough to theoretically have gas planets, but young enough that rocky planets like Earth may still be forming. The six older stars studied by Spitzer average 4 billion years old, nearly the same age as the Sun. They are known to have gas planets, and rocky planets may also be present. Prior to these findings, rings of planetary debris, or \"debris discs,\" around stars the size of the Sun had rarely been observed, because they are fainter and more difficult to see than those around more massive stars. \"The new Hubble image gives us the best look so far at reflected light from a disc around a star the mass of the Sun,\" said Hubble study lead author, Dr. David Ardila of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. \"Basically, it shows one of the possible pasts of our own solar system,\" he said. Debris discs around older stars the same size and age as our Sun, including those hosting known planets, are even harder to detect. These discs are 10 to 100 times thinner than the ones around young stars. Spitzer's highly sensitive infrared detectors were able to sense their warm glow for the first time. \"Spitzer has established the first direct link between planets and discs,\" Beichman said. \"Now, we can study the relationship between the two.\" These studies will help future planet-hunting missions, including NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder and the Space Interferometry Mission, predict which stars have planets. Finding and studying planets around other stars is a key goal of NASA's exploration mission. Rocky planets arise out of large clouds of dust that envelop young stars. Dust particles collide and stick together until a planet eventually forms. Sometimes the accumulating bodies crash together and shatter. Debris from these collisions collects into giant doughnut-shaped discs, the centers of which may be carved out by orbiting planets. With time, the discs fade and a smaller, stable debris disc, like the comet-filled Kuiper Belt in our own solar system, is all that is left. The debris disc imaged by Hubble surrounds the Sun-like star called HD 107146, located 88 light-years away. John Krist, a JPL astronomer, also used Hubble to capture another disc around a smaller star, a red dwarf called AU Microscopii, located 32 light-years away and only 12 million years old. The Hubble view reveals a gap in the disc, where planets may have swept up dust and cleared a path. The disc around HD 107146 also has an inner gap. Beichman and his colleagues at JPL and the University of Arizona, Tucson, used Spitzer to scan 26 older Sun-like stars with known planets, and found six with Kuiper Belt-like debris discs. The stars range from 50 to 160 light-years away. Their discs are about 100 times fainter than those recently imaged by Hubble, and about 100 times brighter than the debris disc around the Sun.

The colliding galaxies, called the Antennae galaxies, are in the process of merging together. As they churn into each other, they throw off massive streamers of stars and dark clouds of dust. Spitzer's heat-seeking eyes peered through that dust and found a hidden population of newborn stars. The new Spitzer image is reported in one of 86 Spitzer papers published in the September issue of The Astrophysical Journal Supplement. This special all-Spitzer issue comes just after the one-year anniversary of the observatory's launch, and testifies to its tremendously successful first year in space. \"This abundance of Spitzer papers just one year after launch shows that the telescope is truly providing a new window on the universe,\" said Dr. Michael Werner, project scientist for Spitzer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"These papers report the earliest results, so the best is yet to come.\" In the latest Antennae galaxies study, led by Dr. Zhong Wang of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass., Spitzer uncovered a new generation of stars at the site where the two galaxies clash. The Antennae galaxies are a classic example of a galactic merger in action. These two spiral galaxies, located 68 million light-years away from Earth, began falling into each other around a common center of gravity about 800 million years ago. As they continue to crash together, clouds of gas are shocked and compressed in a process thought to trigger the birth of new stars. Astronomers believe that the two galaxies will ultimately merge into one spheroidal-shaped galaxy, leaving only hints of their varied pasts. Galactic mergers are common throughout the universe and play a key role in determining how galaxies grow and evolve. Our own Milky Way galaxy, for example, will eventually collide with our closest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. Previous images of the Antennae taken by visible-light telescopes show striking views of the swirling duo, with bright pockets of young stars dotting the spiral arms. At the center of the galaxies, however, where the two overlap, only a dark cloud of dust can be seen. In the new false-color Spitzer image, which has been combined with an image from a ground-based, visible-light telescope to highlight new features, this cloud of buried stars appears bright red. The visible-light information, on the other hand, is colored blue and indicates regions containing older stars. The nuclei, or centers, of the two galaxies are white. \"This more complete picture of star-formation in the Antennae will help us better understand the evolution of colliding galaxies, and the eventual fate of our own,\" said Dr. Giovanni Fazio, a co-author of the research and an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\" Fazio is principal investigator for the infrared array camera on Spitzer, which captured the new Antennae image.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2004-14-spitzer-arrives-at-scene-of-galactic-collision"}, {"title": "Spitzer Sees Ice and Warm Glows in Dark and Dusty Places", "date": "2004-11-09", "content": "Two new results from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope released today are helping astronomers better understand how stars form out of thick clouds of gas and dust, and how the molecules in those clouds ultimately become planets. Two discoveries -- the detection of an oddly dim object inside what was thought to be an empty cloud, and the discovery of icy planetary building blocks in a system believed to resemble our own solar system in its infancy -- were presented today at the first Spitzer science conference in Pasadena, Calif. Since Spitzer science observations began less than one year ago, the infrared capabilities of the space observatory have unveiled hundreds of space objects too dim, cool or distant to be seen with other telescopes. In one discovery, astronomers have detected a faint, star-like object in the least expected of places -- a \"starless core.\" Named for their apparent lack of stars, starless cores are dense knots of gas and dust that should eventually form individual newborn stars. Using Spitzer's infrared eyes, a team of astronomers led by Dr. Neal Evans of the University of Texas at Austin probed dozens of these dusty cores to gain insight into conditions that are needed for stars to form. Starless cores are fascinating to study because they tell us what conditions exist in the instants before a star forms. Understanding this environment is key to improving our theories of star formation, said Evans. But when they looked into one core, called L1014, they found a surprise -- a warm glow coming from a star-like object. The object defies all models of star formation; it is fainter than would be expected for a young star. Astronomers theorize that the mystery object is one of three possibilities: the youngest \"failed star,\" or brown dwarf ever detected; a newborn star caught in a very early stage of development; or something else entirely. This object might represent a different way of forming stars or brown dwarfs. Objects like this are so dim that previous studies would have missed them. It might be like a stealth version of star formation, Evans said. The new object is located 600 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. In another discovery, Spitzer's infrared eyes have peered into the place where planets are born -- the center of a dusty disc surrounding an infant star -- and spied the icy ingredients of planets and comets. This is the first definitive detection of ices in planet-forming discs. This disc resembles closely how we imagine our own solar system looked when it was only a few hundred thousand years old. It has the right size, and the central star is small and probably stable enough to support a water-rich planetary system for billions of years into the future, said Dr. Klaus Pontoppidan of Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, who led the team that made this discovery. Previously, astronomers had seen ices, or ice-coated dust particles, in the large cocoons of gas and dust that envelop young stars. But they were not able to distinguish these ices from those in the inner planet-forming portion of a star's disc. Using Spitzer's ultra-sensitive infrared vision and a clever trick, Pontoppidan and his colleagues were able to overcome this challenge. Their trick was to view a young star and its dusty disc at \"dawn.\" Discs can be viewed from a variety of angles, ranging from the side or edge-on, where the discs appear as dark bars, to face-on, where the discs become washed out by the light of the central star. They found that if they observed a disc at a 20-degree angle, at a position where the star peeks out like our Sun at dawn, they could see the ices. \"We hit the sweet spot,\" said Pontoppidan. \"Our models predicted that the search for ices in discs is a problem of finding an object with just the right viewing angle, and Spitzer confirmed that model.\" In this system, astronomers found ammonium ions as well as components of water and carbon dioxide ice.

Spitzer has discovered for the first time dusty discs around mature, Sun-like stars known to have planets. Hubble captured the most detailed image ever of a brighter disc circling a much younger Sun-like star. The findings offer \"snapshots\" of the process by which our own solar system evolved, from its dusty and chaotic beginnings to its more settled present-day state. \"Young stars have huge reservoirs of planet-building materials, while older ones have only leftover piles of rubble. Hubble saw the reservoirs and Spitzer, the rubble,\" said Dr. Charles Beichman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. He is lead author of the Spitzer study. \"This demonstrates how the two telescopes complement each other,\" he added. The young star observed by Hubble is 50 million to 250 million years old. This is old enough to theoretically have gas planets, but young enough that rocky planets like Earth may still be forming. The six older stars studied by Spitzer average 4 billion years old, nearly the same age as the Sun. They are known to have gas planets, and rocky planets may also be present. Prior to these findings, rings of planetary debris, or \"debris discs,\" around stars the size of the Sun had rarely been observed, because they are fainter and more difficult to see than those around more massive stars. \"The new Hubble image gives us the best look so far at reflected light from a disc around a star the mass of the Sun,\" said Hubble study lead author, Dr. David Ardila of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. \"Basically, it shows one of the possible pasts of our own solar system,\" he said. Debris discs around older stars the same size and age as our Sun, including those hosting known planets, are even harder to detect. These discs are 10 to 100 times thinner than the ones around young stars. Spitzer's highly sensitive infrared detectors were able to sense their warm glow for the first time. \"Spitzer has established the first direct link between planets and discs,\" Beichman said. \"Now, we can study the relationship between the two.\" These studies will help future planet-hunting missions, including NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder and the Space Interferometry Mission, predict which stars have planets. Finding and studying planets around other stars is a key goal of NASA's exploration mission. Rocky planets arise out of large clouds of dust that envelop young stars. Dust particles collide and stick together until a planet eventually forms. Sometimes the accumulating bodies crash together and shatter. Debris from these collisions collects into giant doughnut-shaped discs, the centers of which may be carved out by orbiting planets. With time, the discs fade and a smaller, stable debris disc, like the comet-filled Kuiper Belt in our own solar system, is all that is left. The debris disc imaged by Hubble surrounds the Sun-like star called HD 107146, located 88 light-years away. John Krist, a JPL astronomer, also used Hubble to capture another disc around a smaller star, a red dwarf called AU Microscopii, located 32 light-years away and only 12 million years old. The Hubble view reveals a gap in the disc, where planets may have swept up dust and cleared a path. The disc around HD 107146 also has an inner gap. Beichman and his colleagues at JPL and the University of Arizona, Tucson, used Spitzer to scan 26 older Sun-like stars with known planets, and found six with Kuiper Belt-like debris discs. The stars range from 50 to 160 light-years away. Their discs are about 100 times fainter than those recently imaged by Hubble, and about 100 times brighter than the debris disc around the Sun. These discs are also punctuated by holes at their centers.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2004-22-spitzer-and-hubble-capture-evolving-planetary-systems"}, {"title": "Spitzer Sees Dusty Aftermath of Pluto-Sized Collision", "date": "2005-01-10", "content": "Astronomers say a dusty disk swirling around the nearby star Vega is bigger than earlier thought. It was probably caused by collisions of objects, perhaps as big as the planet Pluto, up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,200 miles) in diameter. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has seen the dusty aftermath of this \"run-in.\" Astronomers think embryonic planets smashed together, shattered into pieces and repeatedly crashed into other fragments to create ever-finer debris. Vega's light heats the debris, and Spitzer's infrared telescope detects the radiation. Vega, located 25 light-years away in the constellation Lyra, is the fifth brightest star in the night sky. It is 60 times brighter than our Sun. Observations of Vega in 1984, with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, provided the first evidence for dust particles around a typical star. Because of Vega's proximity and because its pole faces Earth, it provides a great opportunity for detailed study of the dust cloud around it. \"Vega's debris disk is another piece of evidence demonstrating the evolution of planetary systems is a pretty chaotic process,\" said the lead author of the study, Dr. Kate Su of the University of Arizona, Tucson, Ariz. The findings were presented today at the 205th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Diego. Like a drop of ink spreading out in a glass of water, the particles in Vega's dust cloud don't stay close to the star long. \"The dust we are seeing in the Spitzer images is being blown out by intense light from the star,\" Su said. \"We are witnessing the aftermath of a relatively recent collision, probably within the last million years.\" Scientists say this disk event is short-lived. The majority of the detected material is only a few microns in size, 100 times smaller than a grain of Earth sand. These tiny dust grains leave the system and dissipate into interstellar space on a time scale less than 1,000 years. \"But there are so many tiny grains,\" Su said. \"They add up to a total mass equal to one third of the weight of our moon.\" The mass of these short-lived grains implies a high dust-production rate. The Vega disk would have to have an improbably massive reservoir of planet-building material and collisions to maintain this amount of dust production throughout the star's life (350 million years, 13 times younger than our Sun). \"We think a transient disk phenomenon is more likely,\" Su said. Su and her colleagues were struck by other characteristics of Vega's debris disk, including its physical size. It has a radius of at least 815 astronomical units, roughly 20 times larger than our solar system. One astronomical unit is the distance from Earth to the Sun, which is 150million kilometers (93- million miles). A study of the disk's surface brightness indicates the presence of an inner hole at a radius of 86 astronomical units (twice the distance between Pluto and the Sun). Large embryonic planets at the edge of this inner hole may have collided to make the rest of the debris around Vega. \"Spitzer has obtained the first high spatial-resolution infrared images of Vega's disk,\" said Dr. Michael Werner, co-author and project scientist for Spitzer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Its sensitive infrared detectors have allowed us to see that Vega is surrounded by an enormous disk of debris.\"", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2005-01-spitzer-sees-dusty-aftermath-of-pluto-sized-collision"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Spitzer Arrives at Scene of Galactic Collision", "date": "2004-09-07", "content": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has set its infrared sight on a major galactic collision and witnessed not death, but a teeming nest of life.

Now, astronomers have learned that planets may also circle celestial bodies almost as small as planets. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has spotted a dusty disk of planet-building material around an extraordinarily low-mass brown dwarf, or \"failed star.\" The brown dwarf, called OTS 44, is only 15 times the mass of Jupiter. Previously, the smallest brown dwarf known to host a planet-forming disk was 25 to 30 times more massive than Jupiter. The finding will ultimately help astronomers better understand how and where planets -- including rocky ones resembling our own -- form. \"There may be a host of miniature solar systems out there, in which planets orbit brown dwarfs,\" said Dr. Kevin Luhman, lead author of the new study from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass. \"This leads to all sorts of new questions, like 'Could life exist on such planets?' or 'What do you call a planet circling a planet-sized body? A moon or a planet?'\" Brown dwarfs are something of misfits in the astronomy world. These cool orbs of gas have been called both failed stars and super planets. Like planets, they lack the mass to ignite and produce starlight. Like stars, they are often found alone in space, with no parent body to orbit. \"In this case, we are seeing the ingredients for planets around a brown dwarf near the dividing line between planets and stars. This raises the tantalizing possibility of planet formation around objects that themselves have planetary masses,\" said Dr. Giovanni Fazio, an astronomer at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a co-author of the new study. The results were presented today at the Planet Formation and Detection meeting at the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, Colo., and will be published in the Feb. 10th issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Planet-forming, or protoplanetary, disks are the precursors to planets. Astronomers speculate that the disk circling OTS 44 has enough mass to make a small gas giant planet and a few Earth-sized, rocky ones. This begs the question: Could a habitable planet like Earth sustain life around a brown dwarf? \"If life did exist in this system, it would have to constantly adjust to the dwindling temperatures of a brown dwarf,\" said Luhman. \"For liquid water to be present, the planet would have to be much closer to the brown dwarf than Earth is to our Sun.\" \"It's exciting to speculate about the possibilities for life in such as system, of course at this point we are only beginning to understand the unusual circumstances under which planets arise,\" he added. Brown dwarfs are rare and difficult to study due to their dim light. Though astronomers recently reported what may be the first-ever image of a planet around a brown dwarf called 2M1207, not much is understood about the planet-formation process around these odd balls of gas. Less is understood about low-mass brown dwarfs, of which only a handful are known. OTS 44 was first discovered about six months ago by Luhman and his colleagues using the Gemini Observatory in Chile. The object is located 500 light-years away in the Chamaeleon constellation. Later, the team used Spitzer's highly sensitive infrared eyes to see the dim glow of OTS 44's dusty disk. These observations took only 20 seconds. Longer searches with Spitzer could reveal disks around brown dwarfs below 10 Jupiter masses.

In one discovery, astronomers have detected a faint, star-like object in the least expected of places -- a \"starless core.\" Named for their apparent lack of stars, starless cores are dense knots of gas and dust that should eventually form individual newborn stars. Using Spitzer's infrared eyes, a team of astronomers led by Dr. Neal Evans of the University of Texas at Austin probed dozens of these dusty cores to gain insight into conditions that are needed for stars to form. Starless cores are fascinating to study because they tell us what conditions exist in the instants before a star forms. Understanding this environment is key to improving our theories of star formation, said Evans. But when they looked into one core, called L1014, they found a surprise -- a warm glow coming from a star-like object. The object defies all models of star formation; it is fainter than would be expected for a young star. Astronomers theorize that the mystery object is one of three possibilities: the youngest \"failed star,\" or brown dwarf ever detected; a newborn star caught in a very early stage of development; or something else entirely. This object might represent a different way of forming stars or brown dwarfs. Objects like this are so dim that previous studies would have missed them. It might be like a stealth version of star formation, Evans said. The new object is located 600 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. In another discovery, Spitzer's infrared eyes have peered into the place where planets are born -- the center of a dusty disc surrounding an infant star -- and spied the icy ingredients of planets and comets. This is the first definitive detection of ices in planet-forming discs. This disc resembles closely how we imagine our own solar system looked when it was only a few hundred thousand years old. It has the right size, and the central star is small and probably stable enough to support a water-rich planetary system for billions of years into the future, said Dr. Klaus Pontoppidan of Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, who led the team that made this discovery. Previously, astronomers had seen ices, or ice-coated dust particles, in the large cocoons of gas and dust that envelop young stars. But they were not able to distinguish these ices from those in the inner planet-forming portion of a star's disc. Using Spitzer's ultra-sensitive infrared vision and a clever trick, Pontoppidan and his colleagues were able to overcome this challenge. Their trick was to view a young star and its dusty disc at \"dawn.\" Discs can be viewed from a variety of angles, ranging from the side or edge-on, where the discs appear as dark bars, to face-on, where the discs become washed out by the light of the central star. They found that if they observed a disc at a 20-degree angle, at a position where the star peeks out like our Sun at dawn, they could see the ices. \"We hit the sweet spot,\" said Pontoppidan. \"Our models predicted that the search for ices in discs is a problem of finding an object with just the right viewing angle, and Spitzer confirmed that model.\" In this system, astronomers found ammonium ions as well as components of water and carbon dioxide ice.

Spitzer has discovered for the first time dusty discs around mature, Sun-like stars known to have planets. Hubble captured the most detailed image ever of a brighter disc circling a much younger Sun-like star. The findings offer \"snapshots\" of the process by which our own solar system evolved, from its dusty and chaotic beginnings to its more settled present-day state. \"Young stars have huge reservoirs of planet-building materials, while older ones have only leftover piles of rubble. Hubble saw the reservoirs and Spitzer, the rubble,\" said Dr. Charles Beichman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. He is lead author of the Spitzer study. \"This demonstrates how the two telescopes complement each other,\" he added. The young star observed by Hubble is 50 million to 250 million years old. This is old enough to theoretically have gas planets, but young enough that rocky planets like Earth may still be forming. The six older stars studied by Spitzer average 4 billion years old, nearly the same age as the Sun. They are known to have gas planets, and rocky planets may also be present. Prior to these findings, rings of planetary debris, or \"debris discs,\" around stars the size of the Sun had rarely been observed, because they are fainter and more difficult to see than those around more massive stars. \"The new Hubble image gives us the best look so far at reflected light from a disc around a star the mass of the Sun,\" said Hubble study lead author, Dr. David Ardila of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. \"Basically, it shows one of the possible pasts of our own solar system,\" he said. Debris discs around older stars the same size and age as our Sun, including those hosting known planets, are even harder to detect. These discs are 10 to 100 times thinner than the ones around young stars. Spitzer's highly sensitive infrared detectors were able to sense their warm glow for the first time. \"Spitzer has established the first direct link between planets and discs,\" Beichman said. \"Now, we can study the relationship between the two.\" These studies will help future planet-hunting missions, including NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder and the Space Interferometry Mission, predict which stars have planets. Finding and studying planets around other stars is a key goal of NASA's exploration mission. Rocky planets arise out of large clouds of dust that envelop young stars. Dust particles collide and stick together until a planet eventually forms. Sometimes the accumulating bodies crash together and shatter. Debris from these collisions collects into giant doughnut-shaped discs, the centers of which may be carved out by orbiting planets. With time, the discs fade and a smaller, stable debris disc, like the comet-filled Kuiper Belt in our own solar system, is all that is left. The debris disc imaged by Hubble surrounds the Sun-like star called HD 107146, located 88 light-years away. John Krist, a JPL astronomer, also used Hubble to capture another disc around a smaller star, a red dwarf called AU Microscopii, located 32 light-years away and only 12 million years old. The Hubble view reveals a gap in the disc, where planets may have swept up dust and cleared a path. The disc around HD 107146 also has an inner gap. Beichman and his colleagues at JPL and the University of Arizona, Tucson, used Spitzer to scan 26 older Sun-like stars with known planets, and found six with Kuiper Belt-like debris discs. The stars range from 50 to 160 light-years away. Their discs are about 100 times fainter than those recently imaged by Hubble, and about 100 times brighter than the debris disc around the Sun.

It was probably caused by collisions of objects, perhaps as big as the planet Pluto, up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,200 miles) in diameter. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has seen the dusty aftermath of this \"run-in.\" Astronomers think embryonic planets smashed together, shattered into pieces and repeatedly crashed into other fragments to create ever-finer debris. Vega's light heats the debris, and Spitzer's infrared telescope detects the radiation. Vega, located 25 light-years away in the constellation Lyra, is the fifth brightest star in the night sky. It is 60 times brighter than our Sun. Observations of Vega in 1984, with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, provided the first evidence for dust particles around a typical star. Because of Vega's proximity and because its pole faces Earth, it provides a great opportunity for detailed study of the dust cloud around it. \"Vega's debris disk is another piece of evidence demonstrating the evolution of planetary systems is a pretty chaotic process,\" said the lead author of the study, Dr. Kate Su of the University of Arizona, Tucson, Ariz. The findings were presented today at the 205th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Diego. Like a drop of ink spreading out in a glass of water, the particles in Vega's dust cloud don't stay close to the star long. \"The dust we are seeing in the Spitzer images is being blown out by intense light from the star,\" Su said. \"We are witnessing the aftermath of a relatively recent collision, probably within the last million years.\" Scientists say this disk event is short-lived. The majority of the detected material is only a few microns in size, 100 times smaller than a grain of Earth sand. These tiny dust grains leave the system and dissipate into interstellar space on a time scale less than 1,000 years. \"But there are so many tiny grains,\" Su said. \"They add up to a total mass equal to one third of the weight of our moon.\" The mass of these short-lived grains implies a high dust-production rate. The Vega disk would have to have an improbably massive reservoir of planet-building material and collisions to maintain this amount of dust production throughout the star's life (350 million years, 13 times younger than our Sun). \"We think a transient disk phenomenon is more likely,\" Su said. Su and her colleagues were struck by other characteristics of Vega's debris disk, including its physical size. It has a radius of at least 815 astronomical units, roughly 20 times larger than our solar system. One astronomical unit is the distance from Earth to the Sun, which is 150million kilometers (93- million miles). A study of the disk's surface brightness indicates the presence of an inner hole at a radius of 86 astronomical units (twice the distance between Pluto and the Sun). Large embryonic planets at the edge of this inner hole may have collided to make the rest of the debris around Vega. \"Spitzer has obtained the first high spatial-resolution infrared images of Vega's disk,\" said Dr. Michael Werner, co-author and project scientist for Spitzer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Its sensitive infrared detectors have allowed us to see that Vega is surrounded by an enormous disk of debris.\"", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2005-01-spitzer-sees-dusty-aftermath-of-pluto-sized-collision"}, {"title": "Astronomers Discover Beginnings of 'Mini' Solar System", "date": "2005-02-07", "content": "Moons circle planets, and planets circle stars. Now, astronomers have learned that planets may also circle celestial bodies almost as small as planets. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has spotted a dusty disk of planet-building material around an extraordinarily low-mass brown dwarf, or \"failed star.\" The brown dwarf, called OTS 44, is only 15 times the mass of Jupiter. Previously, the smallest brown dwarf known to host a planet-forming disk was 25 to 30 times more massive than Jupiter. The finding will ultimately help astronomers better understand how and where planets -- including rocky ones resembling our own -- form. \"There may be a host of miniature solar systems out there, in which planets orbit brown dwarfs,\" said Dr. Kevin Luhman, lead author of the new study from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass. \"This leads to all sorts of new questions, like 'Could life exist on such planets?' or 'What do you call a planet circling a planet-sized body? A moon or a planet?'\" Brown dwarfs are something of misfits in the astronomy world. These cool orbs of gas have been called both failed stars and super planets. Like planets, they lack the mass to ignite and produce starlight. Like stars, they are often found alone in space, with no parent body to orbit. \"In this case, we are seeing the ingredients for planets around a brown dwarf near the dividing line between planets and stars. This raises the tantalizing possibility of planet formation around objects that themselves have planetary masses,\" said Dr. Giovanni Fazio, an astronomer at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a co-author of the new study. The results were presented today at the Planet Formation and Detection meeting at the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, Colo., and will be published in the Feb. 10th issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Planet-forming, or protoplanetary, disks are the precursors to planets. Astronomers speculate that the disk circling OTS 44 has enough mass to make a small gas giant planet and a few Earth-sized, rocky ones. This begs the question: Could a habitable planet like Earth sustain life around a brown dwarf? \"If life did exist in this system, it would have to constantly adjust to the dwindling temperatures of a brown dwarf,\" said Luhman. \"For liquid water to be present, the planet would have to be much closer to the brown dwarf than Earth is to our Sun.\" \"It's exciting to speculate about the possibilities for life in such as system, of course at this point we are only beginning to understand the unusual circumstances under which planets arise,\" he added. Brown dwarfs are rare and difficult to study due to their dim light. Though astronomers recently reported what may be the first-ever image of a planet around a brown dwarf called 2M1207, not much is understood about the planet-formation process around these odd balls of gas. Less is understood about low-mass brown dwarfs, of which only a handful are known. OTS 44 was first discovered about six months ago by Luhman and his colleagues using the Gemini Observatory in Chile. The object is located 500 light-years away in the Chamaeleon constellation. Later, the team used Spitzer's highly sensitive infrared eyes to see the dim glow of OTS 44's dusty disk. These observations took only 20 seconds. Longer searches with Spitzer could reveal disks around brown dwarfs below 10 Jupiter masses.

Nuria Calvet, Lori Allen, Lee Hartmann, Thomas Megeath and Philip Myers of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2005-06-astronomers-discover-beginnings-of-mini-solar-system"}, {"title": "Spitzer Reaches 10,000 Mark", "date": "2005-03-01", "content": "Only 541 days into its mission, Spitzer has reached 10,000 science observations. The telescope's Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) captured the milestone observation of nearby spiral galaxy M83 on Feb. 16, 2005 at 9:12:27:02 UTC. Principal Investigator Robert Rubin submitted his proposal to study star formation in the spiral arms of M83 during the first cycle of observation requests. The galaxy is a barred spiral, similar to our own, and can be found in the constellation Hydra about 12 million light years away. Spitzer's 10,000 observations (also known as AORs, or Astronomical Observation Requests) range from stars to brown dwarfs to interstellar clouds of gas and dust to galaxies and have returned to Earth with excellent quality. About 98 percent of the observations have been labeled \"nominal,\" meaning the data has no significant problems and has met the set qualifications in order to be released. \"Most of the data Spitzer transmits is very good,\" Data Quality Analysis (DQA) Research Scientist Vince Mannings said. \"There have been relatively few instances where observations from a particular AOR are missing, overexposed or affected by latent images from bright objects.\" Mannings heads the team responsible for the DQA of the transmitted images. They are the first to examine the data once it has been processed into a viewable format. The DQA team rates each AOR, which is composed of several thousand exposures from Spitzer, and assigns it a quality label. \"The fact that we have reached this milestone observation number of 10,000 so early into the mission is a reflection of how few problems Spitzer has experienced so far and a testament to the number of people that worked insanely hard prior to its flight,\" System Engineer and Test Lead Dr. Lee Bennett said. However, some variables, such as solar flare storms, are beyond the control of the scientists and engineers. These astronomical occurrences help account for the small percentage of images that don't meet quality standards. \"If we detect a problem with the observations for a particular AOR, we contact the Observer Support Team to ensure that the scientist will receive usable data during another transmission,\" Mannings said. The Observer Support Team is headed by Dr. Nancy Silbermann, and works as a liaison between the Spitzer Science Center and the scientists and astronomers who have submitted the AORs. \"We serve as an advocate and police force at the same time,\" Silbermann said. \"Our job is to make sure that everyone is abiding by the rules and guidelines that Spitzer sets forth while also trying to ensure the scientists are happy with their data observations.\" The deadline for the next set of general observation proposals was Feb. 12. Silbermann says the center received about 700 proposals. The Time Allocation Committee, a council composed of science peers, will review these in April and make selections based on their scientific justification to fill the 5400 available observation hours. The scheduling of AORs is a dynamic process and is done five weeks in advance according to the object's visibility and its position and timing relative to when Spitzer is scheduled to operate. Because Spitzer isn't serviceable in deep space and its instruments can only be cooled and functional for about five years, every decision is made on the basis of efficiency. Instrument support teams are actively calibrating Spitzer's instruments to increase the telescope's observational effectiveness. Mannings equates the process to tuning a car. \"We are basically looking for ways to ensure that Spitzer operates longer,\" he said. Of the 10,000 AORs, many are available in the archive database for the public to view on the Spitzer Science Center homepage under \"Science Archive Update.\" These science AORs are giving insight into objects that were previously blocked from our sight by large dark clouds of dust and debris. Visible light has wavelengths shorter than 0.7 micron while infrared wavelengths are detected with Spitzer from 3.5 microns to 170 microns and primarily traces the emission from heat or thermal energy. Spitzer picks up the infrared emissions where Hubble left off in the visible light emissions, essentially filling in the black voids. This will help astronomers and scientists detect other systems similar to our own solar system and study the formation and other processes fueling development.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/feature05-03-spitzer-reaches-10-000-mark"}, {"title": "NASA's Spitzer Marks Beginning of New Age of Planetary Science", "date": "2005-03-22", "content": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has for the first time captured the light from two known planets orbiting stars other than our Sun. The findings mark the beginning of a new age of planetary science, in which \"extrasolar\" planets can be directly measured and compared. \"Spitzer has provided us with a powerful new tool for learning about the temperatures, atmospheres and orbits of planets hundreds of light-years from Earth,\" said Dr. Drake Deming of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., lead author of a new study on one of the planets. \"It's fantastic,\" said Dr. David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass., lead author of a separate study on a different planet. \"We've been hunting for this light for almost 10 years, ever since extrasolar planets were first discovered.\" The Deming paper appears today in Nature's online publication; the Charbonneau paper will be published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal. So far, all confirmed extrasolar planets, including the two recently observed by Spitzer, have been discovered indirectly, mainly by the \"wobble\" technique and more recently, the \"transit\" technique. In the first method, a planet is detected by the gravitational tug it exerts on its parent star, which makes the star wobble. In the second, a planet's presence is inferred when it passes in front of its star, causing the star to dim, or blink. Both strategies use visible-light telescopes and indirectly reveal the mass and size of planets, respectively. In the new studies, Spitzer has directly observed the warm infrared glows of two previously detected \"hot Jupiter\" planets, designated HD 209458b and TrES-1. Hot Jupiters are extrasolar gas giants that zip closely around their parent stars. From their toasty orbits, they soak up ample starlight and shine brightly in infrared wavelengths. To distinguish this planet glow from that of the fiery hot stars, the astronomers used a simple trick. First, they used Spitzer to collect the total infrared light from both the stars and planets. Then, when the planets dipped behind the stars as part of their regular orbit, the astronomers measured the infrared light coming from just the stars. This pinpointed exactly how much infrared light belonged to the planets. \"In visible light, the glare of the star completely overwhelms the glimmer of light reflected by the planet,\" said Charbonneau. \"In infrared, the star-planet contrast is more favorable because the planet emits its own light.\" The Spitzer data told the astronomers that both planets are at least a steaming 1,000 Kelvin (727 degrees Celsius, 1340 Fahrenheit). These measurements confirm that hot Jupiters are indeed hot. Upcoming Spitzer observations using a range of infrared wavelengths are expected to provide more information about the planets' winds and atmospheric compositions. The findings also reawaken a mystery that some astronomers had laid to rest. Planet HD 209458b is unusually puffy, or large for its mass, which some scientists thought was the result of an unseen planet's gravitational pull. If this theory had been correct, HD 209458b would have a non-circular orbit. Spitzer discovered that the planet does in fact follow a circular path. \"We're back to square one,\" said Dr. Sara Seager, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, co-author of the Deming paper. \"For us theorists, that's fun.\" Spitzer is ideally suited for studying extrasolar planets known to transit, or cross, stars the size of our Sun out to distances of 500 light-years. Of the seven known transiting planets, only the two mentioned here meet those criteria. As more are discovered, Spitzer will be able to collect their light -- a bonus for the observatory, considering it was not originally designed to see extrasolar planets. NASA's future Terrestrial Planet Finder coronagraph, set to launch in 2016, will be able to directly image extrasolar planets as small as Earth. Shortly after its discovery in 1999, HD 209458b became the first planet detected via the transit method. That result came from two teams, one led by Charbonneau. TrES-1 was found via the transit method in 2004 as part of the NASA-funded Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey, a ground-based telescope program established in part by Charbonneau.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2005-09-nasas-spitzer-marks-beginning-of-new-age-of-planetary-science"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Spitzer Sees Ice and Warm Glows in Dark and Dusty Places", "date": "2004-11-09", "content": "Two new results from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope released today are helping astronomers better understand how stars form out of thick clouds of gas and dust, and how the molecules in those clouds ultimately become planets.

The Vega disk would have to have an improbably massive reservoir of planet-building material and collisions to maintain this amount of dust production throughout the star's life (350 million years, 13 times younger than our Sun). \"We think a transient disk phenomenon is more likely,\" Su said. Su and her colleagues were struck by other characteristics of Vega's debris disk, including its physical size. It has a radius of at least 815 astronomical units, roughly 20 times larger than our solar system. One astronomical unit is the distance from Earth to the Sun, which is 150million kilometers (93- million miles). A study of the disk's surface brightness indicates the presence of an inner hole at a radius of 86 astronomical units (twice the distance between Pluto and the Sun). Large embryonic planets at the edge of this inner hole may have collided to make the rest of the debris around Vega. \"Spitzer has obtained the first high spatial-resolution infrared images of Vega's disk,\" said Dr. Michael Werner, co-author and project scientist for Spitzer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Its sensitive infrared detectors have allowed us to see that Vega is surrounded by an enormous disk of debris.\"", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2005-01-spitzer-sees-dusty-aftermath-of-pluto-sized-collision"}, {"title": "Astronomers Discover Beginnings of 'Mini' Solar System", "date": "2005-02-07", "content": "Moons circle planets, and planets circle stars.

The findings mark the beginning of a new age of planetary science, in which \"extrasolar\" planets can be directly measured and compared. \"Spitzer has provided us with a powerful new tool for learning about the temperatures, atmospheres and orbits of planets hundreds of light-years from Earth,\" said Dr. Drake Deming of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., lead author of a new study on one of the planets. \"It's fantastic,\" said Dr. David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass., lead author of a separate study on a different planet. \"We've been hunting for this light for almost 10 years, ever since extrasolar planets were first discovered.\" The Deming paper appears today in Nature's online publication; the Charbonneau paper will be published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal. So far, all confirmed extrasolar planets, including the two recently observed by Spitzer, have been discovered indirectly, mainly by the \"wobble\" technique and more recently, the \"transit\" technique. In the first method, a planet is detected by the gravitational tug it exerts on its parent star, which makes the star wobble. In the second, a planet's presence is inferred when it passes in front of its star, causing the star to dim, or blink. Both strategies use visible-light telescopes and indirectly reveal the mass and size of planets, respectively. In the new studies, Spitzer has directly observed the warm infrared glows of two previously detected \"hot Jupiter\" planets, designated HD 209458b and TrES-1. Hot Jupiters are extrasolar gas giants that zip closely around their parent stars. From their toasty orbits, they soak up ample starlight and shine brightly in infrared wavelengths. To distinguish this planet glow from that of the fiery hot stars, the astronomers used a simple trick. First, they used Spitzer to collect the total infrared light from both the stars and planets. Then, when the planets dipped behind the stars as part of their regular orbit, the astronomers measured the infrared light coming from just the stars. This pinpointed exactly how much infrared light belonged to the planets. \"In visible light, the glare of the star completely overwhelms the glimmer of light reflected by the planet,\" said Charbonneau. \"In infrared, the star-planet contrast is more favorable because the planet emits its own light.\" The Spitzer data told the astronomers that both planets are at least a steaming 1,000 Kelvin (727 degrees Celsius, 1340 Fahrenheit). These measurements confirm that hot Jupiters are indeed hot. Upcoming Spitzer observations using a range of infrared wavelengths are expected to provide more information about the planets' winds and atmospheric compositions. The findings also reawaken a mystery that some astronomers had laid to rest. Planet HD 209458b is unusually puffy, or large for its mass, which some scientists thought was the result of an unseen planet's gravitational pull. If this theory had been correct, HD 209458b would have a non-circular orbit. Spitzer discovered that the planet does in fact follow a circular path. \"We're back to square one,\" said Dr. Sara Seager, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, co-author of the Deming paper. \"For us theorists, that's fun.\" Spitzer is ideally suited for studying extrasolar planets known to transit, or cross, stars the size of our Sun out to distances of 500 light-years. Of the seven known transiting planets, only the two mentioned here meet those criteria. As more are discovered, Spitzer will be able to collect their light -- a bonus for the observatory, considering it was not originally designed to see extrasolar planets. NASA's future Terrestrial Planet Finder coronagraph, set to launch in 2016, will be able to directly image extrasolar planets as small as Earth. Shortly after its discovery in 1999, HD 209458b became the first planet detected via the transit method. That result came from two teams, one led by Charbonneau. TrES-1 was found via the transit method in 2004 as part of the NASA-funded Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey, a ground-based telescope program established in part by Charbonneau.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2005-09-nasas-spitzer-marks-beginning-of-new-age-of-planetary-science"}, {"title": "NASA's Spitzer Telescope Sees Signs of Alien Asteroid Belt", "date": "2005-04-20", "content": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has spotted what may be the dusty spray of asteroids banging together in a belt that orbits a star like our Sun. The discovery offers astronomers a rare glimpse at a distant star system that resembles our home, and may represent a significant step toward learning if and where other Earths form. \"Asteroids are the leftover building blocks of rocky planets like Earth,\" said Dr. Charles Beichman of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. Beichman is lead author of a paper that will appear in the Astrophysical Journal. \"We can't directly see other terrestrial planets, but now we can study their dusty fossils.\" Asteroid belts are the junkyards of planetary systems. They are littered with the rocky scraps of failed planets, which occasionally crash into each other, kicking up plumes of dust. In our own solar system, asteroids have collided with Earth, the moon and other planets. If confirmed, the new asteroid belt would be the first detected around a star about the same age and size as our Sun. The star, called HD69830, is located 41 light-years away from Earth. There are two other known distant asteroid belts, but they circle younger, more massive stars. While this new belt is the closest known match to our own, it is not a perfect twin. It is thicker than our asteroid belt, with 25 times as much material. If our solar system had a belt this dense, its dust would light up the night skies as a brilliant band. The alien belt is also much closer to its star. Our asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, whereas this one is located inside an orbit equivalent to that of Venus. Yet, the two belts may have one important trait in common. In our solar system, Jupiter acts as an outer wall to the asteroid belt, shepherding its debris into a series of bands. Similarly, an unseen planet the size of Saturn or smaller may be marshalling this star's rubble. One of NASA's future planet-hunting missions, SIM PlanetQuest, may ultimately identify such a planet orbiting HD 69830. The mission, which will detect planets as small as a few Earth masses, is scheduled to launch in 2011. Beichman and colleagues used Spitzer's infrared spectrograph to observe 85 Sun-like stars. Only HD 69830 was found to possibly host an asteroid belt. They did not see the asteroids themselves, but detected a thick disk of warm dust confined to the inner portion of the star system. The dust most likely came from an asteroid belt in which dusty smash-ups occur relatively frequently, about every 1,000 years. \"Because this belt has more asteroids than ours, collisions are larger and more frequent, which is why Spitzer could detect the belt,\" said Dr. George Rieke, University of Arizona, Tucson, co-author of the paper. \"Our present-day solar system is a quieter place, with impacts of the scale that killed the dinosaurs occurring only every 100 million years or so.\" To confirm that the dust detected by Spitzer is indeed ground-up asteroids, a second less-likely theory will have to be ruled out. According to the astronomers, it is possible a giant comet, almost as big as Pluto, got knocked into the inner solar system and is slowly boiling away, leaving a trail of dust. This hypothesis came about when the astronomers discovered the dust around the star consists of small silicate crystals like those found in comet Hale-Bopp. One of these crystals is the bright green-colored gem called forsterite. \"The 'super comet' theory is more of a long shot,\" Beichman said, \"but we'll know soon enough.\" Future observations of the star using Spitzer and ground-based telescopes are expected to conclude whether asteroids or comets are the source of the dust.

Spitzer has discovered for the first time dusty discs around mature, Sun-like stars known to have planets. Hubble captured the most detailed image ever of a brighter disc circling a much younger Sun-like star. The findings offer \"snapshots\" of the process by which our own solar system evolved, from its dusty and chaotic beginnings to its more settled present-day state. \"Young stars have huge reservoirs of planet-building materials, while older ones have only leftover piles of rubble. Hubble saw the reservoirs and Spitzer, the rubble,\" said Dr. Charles Beichman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. He is lead author of the Spitzer study. \"This demonstrates how the two telescopes complement each other,\" he added. The young star observed by Hubble is 50 million to 250 million years old. This is old enough to theoretically have gas planets, but young enough that rocky planets like Earth may still be forming. The six older stars studied by Spitzer average 4 billion years old, nearly the same age as the Sun. They are known to have gas planets, and rocky planets may also be present. Prior to these findings, rings of planetary debris, or \"debris discs,\" around stars the size of the Sun had rarely been observed, because they are fainter and more difficult to see than those around more massive stars. \"The new Hubble image gives us the best look so far at reflected light from a disc around a star the mass of the Sun,\" said Hubble study lead author, Dr. David Ardila of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. \"Basically, it shows one of the possible pasts of our own solar system,\" he said. Debris discs around older stars the same size and age as our Sun, including those hosting known planets, are even harder to detect. These discs are 10 to 100 times thinner than the ones around young stars. Spitzer's highly sensitive infrared detectors were able to sense their warm glow for the first time. \"Spitzer has established the first direct link between planets and discs,\" Beichman said. \"Now, we can study the relationship between the two.\" These studies will help future planet-hunting missions, including NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder and the Space Interferometry Mission, predict which stars have planets. Finding and studying planets around other stars is a key goal of NASA's exploration mission. Rocky planets arise out of large clouds of dust that envelop young stars. Dust particles collide and stick together until a planet eventually forms. Sometimes the accumulating bodies crash together and shatter. Debris from these collisions collects into giant doughnut-shaped discs, the centers of which may be carved out by orbiting planets. With time, the discs fade and a smaller, stable debris disc, like the comet-filled Kuiper Belt in our own solar system, is all that is left. The debris disc imaged by Hubble surrounds the Sun-like star called HD 107146, located 88 light-years away. John Krist, a JPL astronomer, also used Hubble to capture another disc around a smaller star, a red dwarf called AU Microscopii, located 32 light-years away and only 12 million years old. The Hubble view reveals a gap in the disc, where planets may have swept up dust and cleared a path. The disc around HD 107146 also has an inner gap. Beichman and his colleagues at JPL and the University of Arizona, Tucson, used Spitzer to scan 26 older Sun-like stars with known planets, and found six with Kuiper Belt-like debris discs. The stars range from 50 to 160 light-years away. Their discs are about 100 times fainter than those recently imaged by Hubble, and about 100 times brighter than the debris disc around the Sun. These discs are also punctuated by holes at their centers.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2004-22-spitzer-and-hubble-capture-evolving-planetary-systems"}, {"title": "Spitzer Sees Dusty Aftermath of Pluto-Sized Collision", "date": "2005-01-10", "content": "Astronomers say a dusty disk swirling around the nearby star Vega is bigger than earlier thought. It was probably caused by collisions of objects, perhaps as big as the planet Pluto, up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,200 miles) in diameter. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has seen the dusty aftermath of this \"run-in.\" Astronomers think embryonic planets smashed together, shattered into pieces and repeatedly crashed into other fragments to create ever-finer debris. Vega's light heats the debris, and Spitzer's infrared telescope detects the radiation. Vega, located 25 light-years away in the constellation Lyra, is the fifth brightest star in the night sky. It is 60 times brighter than our Sun. Observations of Vega in 1984, with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, provided the first evidence for dust particles around a typical star. Because of Vega's proximity and because its pole faces Earth, it provides a great opportunity for detailed study of the dust cloud around it. \"Vega's debris disk is another piece of evidence demonstrating the evolution of planetary systems is a pretty chaotic process,\" said the lead author of the study, Dr. Kate Su of the University of Arizona, Tucson, Ariz. The findings were presented today at the 205th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Diego. Like a drop of ink spreading out in a glass of water, the particles in Vega's dust cloud don't stay close to the star long. \"The dust we are seeing in the Spitzer images is being blown out by intense light from the star,\" Su said. \"We are witnessing the aftermath of a relatively recent collision, probably within the last million years.\" Scientists say this disk event is short-lived. The majority of the detected material is only a few microns in size, 100 times smaller than a grain of Earth sand.

The findings mark the beginning of a new age of planetary science, in which \"extrasolar\" planets can be directly measured and compared. \"Spitzer has provided us with a powerful new tool for learning about the temperatures, atmospheres and orbits of planets hundreds of light-years from Earth,\" said Dr. Drake Deming of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., lead author of a new study on one of the planets. \"It's fantastic,\" said Dr. David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass., lead author of a separate study on a different planet. \"We've been hunting for this light for almost 10 years, ever since extrasolar planets were first discovered.\" The Deming paper appears today in Nature's online publication; the Charbonneau paper will be published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal. So far, all confirmed extrasolar planets, including the two recently observed by Spitzer, have been discovered indirectly, mainly by the \"wobble\" technique and more recently, the \"transit\" technique. In the first method, a planet is detected by the gravitational tug it exerts on its parent star, which makes the star wobble. In the second, a planet's presence is inferred when it passes in front of its star, causing the star to dim, or blink. Both strategies use visible-light telescopes and indirectly reveal the mass and size of planets, respectively. In the new studies, Spitzer has directly observed the warm infrared glows of two previously detected \"hot Jupiter\" planets, designated HD 209458b and TrES-1. Hot Jupiters are extrasolar gas giants that zip closely around their parent stars. From their toasty orbits, they soak up ample starlight and shine brightly in infrared wavelengths. To distinguish this planet glow from that of the fiery hot stars, the astronomers used a simple trick. First, they used Spitzer to collect the total infrared light from both the stars and planets. Then, when the planets dipped behind the stars as part of their regular orbit, the astronomers measured the infrared light coming from just the stars. This pinpointed exactly how much infrared light belonged to the planets. \"In visible light, the glare of the star completely overwhelms the glimmer of light reflected by the planet,\" said Charbonneau. \"In infrared, the star-planet contrast is more favorable because the planet emits its own light.\" The Spitzer data told the astronomers that both planets are at least a steaming 1,000 Kelvin (727 degrees Celsius, 1340 Fahrenheit). These measurements confirm that hot Jupiters are indeed hot. Upcoming Spitzer observations using a range of infrared wavelengths are expected to provide more information about the planets' winds and atmospheric compositions. The findings also reawaken a mystery that some astronomers had laid to rest. Planet HD 209458b is unusually puffy, or large for its mass, which some scientists thought was the result of an unseen planet's gravitational pull. If this theory had been correct, HD 209458b would have a non-circular orbit. Spitzer discovered that the planet does in fact follow a circular path. \"We're back to square one,\" said Dr. Sara Seager, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, co-author of the Deming paper. \"For us theorists, that's fun.\" Spitzer is ideally suited for studying extrasolar planets known to transit, or cross, stars the size of our Sun out to distances of 500 light-years. Of the seven known transiting planets, only the two mentioned here meet those criteria. As more are discovered, Spitzer will be able to collect their light -- a bonus for the observatory, considering it was not originally designed to see extrasolar planets. NASA's future Terrestrial Planet Finder coronagraph, set to launch in 2016, will be able to directly image extrasolar planets as small as Earth. Shortly after its discovery in 1999, HD 209458b became the first planet detected via the transit method. That result came from two teams, one led by Charbonneau. TrES-1 was found via the transit method in 2004 as part of the NASA-funded Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey, a ground-based telescope program established in part by Charbonneau.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2005-09-nasas-spitzer-marks-beginning-of-new-age-of-planetary-science"}, {"title": "NASA's Spitzer Telescope Sees Signs of Alien Asteroid Belt", "date": "2005-04-20", "content": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has spotted what may be the dusty spray of asteroids banging together in a belt that orbits a star like our Sun. The discovery offers astronomers a rare glimpse at a distant star system that resembles our home, and may represent a significant step toward learning if and where other Earths form. \"Asteroids are the leftover building blocks of rocky planets like Earth,\" said Dr. Charles Beichman of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. Beichman is lead author of a paper that will appear in the Astrophysical Journal. \"We can't directly see other terrestrial planets, but now we can study their dusty fossils.\" Asteroid belts are the junkyards of planetary systems. They are littered with the rocky scraps of failed planets, which occasionally crash into each other, kicking up plumes of dust. In our own solar system, asteroids have collided with Earth, the moon and other planets. If confirmed, the new asteroid belt would be the first detected around a star about the same age and size as our Sun. The star, called HD69830, is located 41 light-years away from Earth. There are two other known distant asteroid belts, but they circle younger, more massive stars. While this new belt is the closest known match to our own, it is not a perfect twin. It is thicker than our asteroid belt, with 25 times as much material. If our solar system had a belt this dense, its dust would light up the night skies as a brilliant band. The alien belt is also much closer to its star. Our asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, whereas this one is located inside an orbit equivalent to that of Venus. Yet, the two belts may have one important trait in common. In our solar system, Jupiter acts as an outer wall to the asteroid belt, shepherding its debris into a series of bands. Similarly, an unseen planet the size of Saturn or smaller may be marshalling this star's rubble. One of NASA's future planet-hunting missions, SIM PlanetQuest, may ultimately identify such a planet orbiting HD 69830. The mission, which will detect planets as small as a few Earth masses, is scheduled to launch in 2011. Beichman and colleagues used Spitzer's infrared spectrograph to observe 85 Sun-like stars. Only HD 69830 was found to possibly host an asteroid belt. They did not see the asteroids themselves, but detected a thick disk of warm dust confined to the inner portion of the star system. The dust most likely came from an asteroid belt in which dusty smash-ups occur relatively frequently, about every 1,000 years. \"Because this belt has more asteroids than ours, collisions are larger and more frequent, which is why Spitzer could detect the belt,\" said Dr. George Rieke, University of Arizona, Tucson, co-author of the paper. \"Our present-day solar system is a quieter place, with impacts of the scale that killed the dinosaurs occurring only every 100 million years or so.\" To confirm that the dust detected by Spitzer is indeed ground-up asteroids, a second less-likely theory will have to be ruled out. According to the astronomers, it is possible a giant comet, almost as big as Pluto, got knocked into the inner solar system and is slowly boiling away, leaving a trail of dust. This hypothesis came about when the astronomers discovered the dust around the star consists of small silicate crystals like those found in comet Hale-Bopp. One of these crystals is the bright green-colored gem called forsterite. \"The 'super comet' theory is more of a long shot,\" Beichman said, \"but we'll know soon enough.\" Future observations of the star using Spitzer and ground-based telescopes are expected to conclude whether asteroids or comets are the source of the dust.

It was probably caused by collisions of objects, perhaps as big as the planet Pluto, up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,200 miles) in diameter. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has seen the dusty aftermath of this \"run-in.\" Astronomers think embryonic planets smashed together, shattered into pieces and repeatedly crashed into other fragments to create ever-finer debris. Vega's light heats the debris, and Spitzer's infrared telescope detects the radiation. Vega, located 25 light-years away in the constellation Lyra, is the fifth brightest star in the night sky. It is 60 times brighter than our Sun. Observations of Vega in 1984, with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, provided the first evidence for dust particles around a typical star. Because of Vega's proximity and because its pole faces Earth, it provides a great opportunity for detailed study of the dust cloud around it. \"Vega's debris disk is another piece of evidence demonstrating the evolution of planetary systems is a pretty chaotic process,\" said the lead author of the study, Dr. Kate Su of the University of Arizona, Tucson, Ariz. The findings were presented today at the 205th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Diego. Like a drop of ink spreading out in a glass of water, the particles in Vega's dust cloud don't stay close to the star long. \"The dust we are seeing in the Spitzer images is being blown out by intense light from the star,\" Su said. \"We are witnessing the aftermath of a relatively recent collision, probably within the last million years.\" Scientists say this disk event is short-lived. The majority of the detected material is only a few microns in size, 100 times smaller than a grain of Earth sand. These tiny dust grains leave the system and dissipate into interstellar space on a time scale less than 1,000 years. \"But there are so many tiny grains,\" Su said. \"They add up to a total mass equal to one third of the weight of our moon.\" The mass of these short-lived grains implies a high dust-production rate. The Vega disk would have to have an improbably massive reservoir of planet-building material and collisions to maintain this amount of dust production throughout the star's life (350 million years, 13 times younger than our Sun). \"We think a transient disk phenomenon is more likely,\" Su said. Su and her colleagues were struck by other characteristics of Vega's debris disk, including its physical size. It has a radius of at least 815 astronomical units, roughly 20 times larger than our solar system. One astronomical unit is the distance from Earth to the Sun, which is 150million kilometers (93- million miles). A study of the disk's surface brightness indicates the presence of an inner hole at a radius of 86 astronomical units (twice the distance between Pluto and the Sun). Large embryonic planets at the edge of this inner hole may have collided to make the rest of the debris around Vega. \"Spitzer has obtained the first high spatial-resolution infrared images of Vega's disk,\" said Dr. Michael Werner, co-author and project scientist for Spitzer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Its sensitive infrared detectors have allowed us to see that Vega is surrounded by an enormous disk of debris.\"", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2005-01-spitzer-sees-dusty-aftermath-of-pluto-sized-collision"}, {"title": "Astronomers Discover Beginnings of 'Mini' Solar System", "date": "2005-02-07", "content": "Moons circle planets, and planets circle stars. Now, astronomers have learned that planets may also circle celestial bodies almost as small as planets. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has spotted a dusty disk of planet-building material around an extraordinarily low-mass brown dwarf, or \"failed star.\" The brown dwarf, called OTS 44, is only 15 times the mass of Jupiter. Previously, the smallest brown dwarf known to host a planet-forming disk was 25 to 30 times more massive than Jupiter. The finding will ultimately help astronomers better understand how and where planets -- including rocky ones resembling our own -- form. \"There may be a host of miniature solar systems out there, in which planets orbit brown dwarfs,\" said Dr. Kevin Luhman, lead author of the new study from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass. \"This leads to all sorts of new questions, like 'Could life exist on such planets?' or 'What do you call a planet circling a planet-sized body? A moon or a planet?'\" Brown dwarfs are something of misfits in the astronomy world. These cool orbs of gas have been called both failed stars and super planets. Like planets, they lack the mass to ignite and produce starlight. Like stars, they are often found alone in space, with no parent body to orbit. \"In this case, we are seeing the ingredients for planets around a brown dwarf near the dividing line between planets and stars. This raises the tantalizing possibility of planet formation around objects that themselves have planetary masses,\" said Dr. Giovanni Fazio, an astronomer at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a co-author of the new study. The results were presented today at the Planet Formation and Detection meeting at the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, Colo., and will be published in the Feb. 10th issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Planet-forming, or protoplanetary, disks are the precursors to planets. Astronomers speculate that the disk circling OTS 44 has enough mass to make a small gas giant planet and a few Earth-sized, rocky ones. This begs the question: Could a habitable planet like Earth sustain life around a brown dwarf? \"If life did exist in this system, it would have to constantly adjust to the dwindling temperatures of a brown dwarf,\" said Luhman. \"For liquid water to be present, the planet would have to be much closer to the brown dwarf than Earth is to our Sun.\" \"It's exciting to speculate about the possibilities for life in such as system, of course at this point we are only beginning to understand the unusual circumstances under which planets arise,\" he added. Brown dwarfs are rare and difficult to study due to their dim light. Though astronomers recently reported what may be the first-ever image of a planet around a brown dwarf called 2M1207, not much is understood about the planet-formation process around these odd balls of gas. Less is understood about low-mass brown dwarfs, of which only a handful are known. OTS 44 was first discovered about six months ago by Luhman and his colleagues using the Gemini Observatory in Chile. The object is located 500 light-years away in the Chamaeleon constellation. Later, the team used Spitzer's highly sensitive infrared eyes to see the dim glow of OTS 44's dusty disk. These observations took only 20 seconds. Longer searches with Spitzer could reveal disks around brown dwarfs below 10 Jupiter masses.

The telescope's Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) captured the milestone observation of nearby spiral galaxy M83 on Feb. 16, 2005 at 9:12:27:02 UTC. Principal Investigator Robert Rubin submitted his proposal to study star formation in the spiral arms of M83 during the first cycle of observation requests. The galaxy is a barred spiral, similar to our own, and can be found in the constellation Hydra about 12 million light years away. Spitzer's 10,000 observations (also known as AORs, or Astronomical Observation Requests) range from stars to brown dwarfs to interstellar clouds of gas and dust to galaxies and have returned to Earth with excellent quality. About 98 percent of the observations have been labeled \"nominal,\" meaning the data has no significant problems and has met the set qualifications in order to be released. \"Most of the data Spitzer transmits is very good,\" Data Quality Analysis (DQA) Research Scientist Vince Mannings said. \"There have been relatively few instances where observations from a particular AOR are missing, overexposed or affected by latent images from bright objects.\" Mannings heads the team responsible for the DQA of the transmitted images. They are the first to examine the data once it has been processed into a viewable format. The DQA team rates each AOR, which is composed of several thousand exposures from Spitzer, and assigns it a quality label. \"The fact that we have reached this milestone observation number of 10,000 so early into the mission is a reflection of how few problems Spitzer has experienced so far and a testament to the number of people that worked insanely hard prior to its flight,\" System Engineer and Test Lead Dr. Lee Bennett said. However, some variables, such as solar flare storms, are beyond the control of the scientists and engineers. These astronomical occurrences help account for the small percentage of images that don't meet quality standards. \"If we detect a problem with the observations for a particular AOR, we contact the Observer Support Team to ensure that the scientist will receive usable data during another transmission,\" Mannings said. The Observer Support Team is headed by Dr. Nancy Silbermann, and works as a liaison between the Spitzer Science Center and the scientists and astronomers who have submitted the AORs. \"We serve as an advocate and police force at the same time,\" Silbermann said. \"Our job is to make sure that everyone is abiding by the rules and guidelines that Spitzer sets forth while also trying to ensure the scientists are happy with their data observations.\" The deadline for the next set of general observation proposals was Feb. 12. Silbermann says the center received about 700 proposals. The Time Allocation Committee, a council composed of science peers, will review these in April and make selections based on their scientific justification to fill the 5400 available observation hours. The scheduling of AORs is a dynamic process and is done five weeks in advance according to the object's visibility and its position and timing relative to when Spitzer is scheduled to operate. Because Spitzer isn't serviceable in deep space and its instruments can only be cooled and functional for about five years, every decision is made on the basis of efficiency. Instrument support teams are actively calibrating Spitzer's instruments to increase the telescope's observational effectiveness. Mannings equates the process to tuning a car. \"We are basically looking for ways to ensure that Spitzer operates longer,\" he said. Of the 10,000 AORs, many are available in the archive database for the public to view on the Spitzer Science Center homepage under \"Science Archive Update.\" These science AORs are giving insight into objects that were previously blocked from our sight by large dark clouds of dust and debris.

As if that is not challenging enough, the comet's size, shape and other characteristics are not entirely known. Two of NASA's eyes in the sky, the Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes, helped scientists prepare for the comet encounter. From their orbits high above Earth, the telescopes watched Tempel 1 in early 2004. Together they came up with the best estimates of the comet's size, shape, reflectivity and rotation rate. The data may help Deep Impact snap pictures of the dramatic rendezvous and increase the probability of making contact with the comet. \"Even tiny adjustments to our model of Tempel 1 are crucial to hitting the target and setting camera exposure times,\" said Dr. Carey Lisse, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Md. Lisse is team leader for the Tempel 1 Spitzer studies. Previous observations of Tempel 1 taken with ground-based telescopes indicated the comet is dark and oblong, with a width of a few miles, or kilometers. Spitzer and Hubble refined these measurements, revealing a matte black comet approximately 14 by 4 kilometers (8.7 by 2.5 miles), or roughly one-half the size of Manhattan. \"Spitzer was crucial in pinning down the comet's size,\" said Dr. Michael A'Hearn of the University of Maryland, College Park. He is principal investigator for Deep Impact and the Hubble observations. \"We'll know exactly what it looks like when we get there.\" The Deep Impact spacecraft was launched on Jan. 12, 2005. Its mission is to study the primordial soup of our solar system, which is sealed away inside comets. On July 3, as it approaches Tempel 1, the spacecraft will separate into two parts. The impactor will attempt the tricky task of placing itself in the path of the speeding snowball, while the second part, the flyby spacecraft, swings around for a ringside view. After the impactor is released, its specialized software will steer it toward the sunlit portion of Tempel 1's nucleus. To program the software, mission planners at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., needed to know the size and reflectivity of Tempel 1's surface. Since its surface can't be observed directly from Earth, scientists turned to Spitzer's infrared eyes to measure its size. When viewing a comet in visible light from very far away, only reflected sunlight can be seen, so a big, dark comet can look the same as a highly reflective, small comet. In infrared light, a comet's radiated heat is measured, providing a direct look at its size. Once the size of Tempel 1 was known, scientists could calculate surface reflectivity using a combination of Spitzer and Hubble data. They found Tempel 1 reflects only four percent of the sunlight that falls on it. \"Knowing the reflectivity also tells us how to set up our cameras,\" Lisse said. \"Like photographers, it's important for us to know our subject before the shoot.\" Tempel 1's shape and two-day rotation rate were derived from long-term observations made by various telescopes, including Hubble, Spitzer and the University of Hawaii's 2.2-meter telescope at Mauna Kea. In addition to the flyby spacecraft, at least 30 telescopes around the world, including Spitzer, Hubble and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, will be watching the dramatic impact.

Now, astronomers have learned that planets may also circle celestial bodies almost as small as planets. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has spotted a dusty disk of planet-building material around an extraordinarily low-mass brown dwarf, or \"failed star.\" The brown dwarf, called OTS 44, is only 15 times the mass of Jupiter. Previously, the smallest brown dwarf known to host a planet-forming disk was 25 to 30 times more massive than Jupiter. The finding will ultimately help astronomers better understand how and where planets -- including rocky ones resembling our own -- form. \"There may be a host of miniature solar systems out there, in which planets orbit brown dwarfs,\" said Dr. Kevin Luhman, lead author of the new study from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass. \"This leads to all sorts of new questions, like 'Could life exist on such planets?' or 'What do you call a planet circling a planet-sized body? A moon or a planet?'\" Brown dwarfs are something of misfits in the astronomy world. These cool orbs of gas have been called both failed stars and super planets. Like planets, they lack the mass to ignite and produce starlight. Like stars, they are often found alone in space, with no parent body to orbit. \"In this case, we are seeing the ingredients for planets around a brown dwarf near the dividing line between planets and stars. This raises the tantalizing possibility of planet formation around objects that themselves have planetary masses,\" said Dr. Giovanni Fazio, an astronomer at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a co-author of the new study. The results were presented today at the Planet Formation and Detection meeting at the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, Colo., and will be published in the Feb. 10th issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Planet-forming, or protoplanetary, disks are the precursors to planets. Astronomers speculate that the disk circling OTS 44 has enough mass to make a small gas giant planet and a few Earth-sized, rocky ones. This begs the question: Could a habitable planet like Earth sustain life around a brown dwarf? \"If life did exist in this system, it would have to constantly adjust to the dwindling temperatures of a brown dwarf,\" said Luhman. \"For liquid water to be present, the planet would have to be much closer to the brown dwarf than Earth is to our Sun.\" \"It's exciting to speculate about the possibilities for life in such as system, of course at this point we are only beginning to understand the unusual circumstances under which planets arise,\" he added. Brown dwarfs are rare and difficult to study due to their dim light. Though astronomers recently reported what may be the first-ever image of a planet around a brown dwarf called 2M1207, not much is understood about the planet-formation process around these odd balls of gas. Less is understood about low-mass brown dwarfs, of which only a handful are known. OTS 44 was first discovered about six months ago by Luhman and his colleagues using the Gemini Observatory in Chile. The object is located 500 light-years away in the Chamaeleon constellation. Later, the team used Spitzer's highly sensitive infrared eyes to see the dim glow of OTS 44's dusty disk. These observations took only 20 seconds. Longer searches with Spitzer could reveal disks around brown dwarfs below 10 Jupiter masses.

They are littered with the rocky scraps of failed planets, which occasionally crash into each other, kicking up plumes of dust. In our own solar system, asteroids have collided with Earth, the moon and other planets. If confirmed, the new asteroid belt would be the first detected around a star about the same age and size as our Sun. The star, called HD69830, is located 41 light-years away from Earth. There are two other known distant asteroid belts, but they circle younger, more massive stars. While this new belt is the closest known match to our own, it is not a perfect twin. It is thicker than our asteroid belt, with 25 times as much material. If our solar system had a belt this dense, its dust would light up the night skies as a brilliant band. The alien belt is also much closer to its star. Our asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, whereas this one is located inside an orbit equivalent to that of Venus. Yet, the two belts may have one important trait in common. In our solar system, Jupiter acts as an outer wall to the asteroid belt, shepherding its debris into a series of bands. Similarly, an unseen planet the size of Saturn or smaller may be marshalling this star's rubble. One of NASA's future planet-hunting missions, SIM PlanetQuest, may ultimately identify such a planet orbiting HD 69830. The mission, which will detect planets as small as a few Earth masses, is scheduled to launch in 2011. Beichman and colleagues used Spitzer's infrared spectrograph to observe 85 Sun-like stars. Only HD 69830 was found to possibly host an asteroid belt. They did not see the asteroids themselves, but detected a thick disk of warm dust confined to the inner portion of the star system. The dust most likely came from an asteroid belt in which dusty smash-ups occur relatively frequently, about every 1,000 years. \"Because this belt has more asteroids than ours, collisions are larger and more frequent, which is why Spitzer could detect the belt,\" said Dr. George Rieke, University of Arizona, Tucson, co-author of the paper. \"Our present-day solar system is a quieter place, with impacts of the scale that killed the dinosaurs occurring only every 100 million years or so.\" To confirm that the dust detected by Spitzer is indeed ground-up asteroids, a second less-likely theory will have to be ruled out. According to the astronomers, it is possible a giant comet, almost as big as Pluto, got knocked into the inner solar system and is slowly boiling away, leaving a trail of dust. This hypothesis came about when the astronomers discovered the dust around the star consists of small silicate crystals like those found in comet Hale-Bopp. One of these crystals is the bright green-colored gem called forsterite. \"The 'super comet' theory is more of a long shot,\" Beichman said, \"but we'll know soon enough.\" Future observations of the star using Spitzer and ground-based telescopes are expected to conclude whether asteroids or comets are the source of the dust.

As if that is not challenging enough, the comet's size, shape and other characteristics are not entirely known. Two of NASA's eyes in the sky, the Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes, helped scientists prepare for the comet encounter. From their orbits high above Earth, the telescopes watched Tempel 1 in early 2004. Together they came up with the best estimates of the comet's size, shape, reflectivity and rotation rate. The data may help Deep Impact snap pictures of the dramatic rendezvous and increase the probability of making contact with the comet. \"Even tiny adjustments to our model of Tempel 1 are crucial to hitting the target and setting camera exposure times,\" said Dr. Carey Lisse, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Md. Lisse is team leader for the Tempel 1 Spitzer studies. Previous observations of Tempel 1 taken with ground-based telescopes indicated the comet is dark and oblong, with a width of a few miles, or kilometers. Spitzer and Hubble refined these measurements, revealing a matte black comet approximately 14 by 4 kilometers (8.7 by 2.5 miles), or roughly one-half the size of Manhattan. \"Spitzer was crucial in pinning down the comet's size,\" said Dr. Michael A'Hearn of the University of Maryland, College Park. He is principal investigator for Deep Impact and the Hubble observations. \"We'll know exactly what it looks like when we get there.\" The Deep Impact spacecraft was launched on Jan. 12, 2005. Its mission is to study the primordial soup of our solar system, which is sealed away inside comets. On July 3, as it approaches Tempel 1, the spacecraft will separate into two parts. The impactor will attempt the tricky task of placing itself in the path of the speeding snowball, while the second part, the flyby spacecraft, swings around for a ringside view. After the impactor is released, its specialized software will steer it toward the sunlit portion of Tempel 1's nucleus. To program the software, mission planners at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., needed to know the size and reflectivity of Tempel 1's surface. Since its surface can't be observed directly from Earth, scientists turned to Spitzer's infrared eyes to measure its size. When viewing a comet in visible light from very far away, only reflected sunlight can be seen, so a big, dark comet can look the same as a highly reflective, small comet. In infrared light, a comet's radiated heat is measured, providing a direct look at its size. Once the size of Tempel 1 was known, scientists could calculate surface reflectivity using a combination of Spitzer and Hubble data. They found Tempel 1 reflects only four percent of the sunlight that falls on it. \"Knowing the reflectivity also tells us how to set up our cameras,\" Lisse said. \"Like photographers, it's important for us to know our subject before the shoot.\" Tempel 1's shape and two-day rotation rate were derived from long-term observations made by various telescopes, including Hubble, Spitzer and the University of Hawaii's 2.2-meter telescope at Mauna Kea. In addition to the flyby spacecraft, at least 30 telescopes around the world, including Spitzer, Hubble and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, will be watching the dramatic impact.

The dust most likely came from an asteroid belt in which dusty smash-ups occur relatively frequently, about every 1,000 years. \"Because this belt has more asteroids than ours, collisions are larger and more frequent, which is why Spitzer could detect the belt,\" said Dr. George Rieke, University of Arizona, Tucson, co-author of the paper. \"Our present-day solar system is a quieter place, with impacts of the scale that killed the dinosaurs occurring only every 100 million years or so.\" To confirm that the dust detected by Spitzer is indeed ground-up asteroids, a second less-likely theory will have to be ruled out. According to the astronomers, it is possible a giant comet, almost as big as Pluto, got knocked into the inner solar system and is slowly boiling away, leaving a trail of dust. This hypothesis came about when the astronomers discovered the dust around the star consists of small silicate crystals like those found in comet Hale-Bopp. One of these crystals is the bright green-colored gem called forsterite. \"The 'super comet' theory is more of a long shot,\" Beichman said, \"but we'll know soon enough.\" Future observations of the star using Spitzer and ground-based telescopes are expected to conclude whether asteroids or comets are the source of the dust.

As if that is not challenging enough, the comet's size, shape and other characteristics are not entirely known. Two of NASA's eyes in the sky, the Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes, helped scientists prepare for the comet encounter. From their orbits high above Earth, the telescopes watched Tempel 1 in early 2004. Together they came up with the best estimates of the comet's size, shape, reflectivity and rotation rate.

Lisse is team leader for the Tempel 1 Spitzer studies. Previous observations of Tempel 1 taken with ground-based telescopes indicated the comet is dark and oblong, with a width of a few miles, or kilometers. Spitzer and Hubble refined these measurements, revealing a matte black comet approximately 14 by 4 kilometers (8.7 by 2.5 miles), or roughly one-half the size of Manhattan. \"Spitzer was crucial in pinning down the comet's size,\" said Dr. Michael A'Hearn of the University of Maryland, College Park.

When viewing a comet in visible light from very far away, only reflected sunlight can be seen, so a big, dark comet can look the same as a highly reflective, small comet. In infrared light, a comet's radiated heat is measured, providing a direct look at its size. Once the size of Tempel 1 was known, scientists could calculate surface reflectivity using a combination of Spitzer and Hubble data. They found Tempel 1 reflects only four percent of the sunlight that falls on it. \"Knowing the reflectivity also tells us how to set up our cameras,\" Lisse said. \"Like photographers, it's important for us to know our subject before the shoot.\" Tempel 1's shape and two-day rotation rate were derived from long-term observations made by various telescopes, including Hubble, Spitzer and the University of Hawaii's 2.2-meter telescope at Mauna Kea.

The discovery offers astronomers a rare glimpse at a distant star system that resembles our home, and may represent a significant step toward learning if and where other Earths form. \"Asteroids are the leftover building blocks of rocky planets like Earth,\" said Dr. Charles Beichman of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. Beichman is lead author of a paper that will appear in the Astrophysical Journal. \"We can't directly see other terrestrial planets, but now we can study their dusty fossils.\" Asteroid belts are the junkyards of planetary systems. They are littered with the rocky scraps of failed planets, which occasionally crash into each other, kicking up plumes of dust. In our own solar system, asteroids have collided with Earth, the moon and other planets. If confirmed, the new asteroid belt would be the first detected around a star about the same age and size as our Sun. The star, called HD69830, is located 41 light-years away from Earth. There are two other known distant asteroid belts, but they circle younger, more massive stars. While this new belt is the closest known match to our own, it is not a perfect twin. It is thicker than our asteroid belt, with 25 times as much material. If our solar system had a belt this dense, its dust would light up the night skies as a brilliant band. The alien belt is also much closer to its star. Our asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, whereas this one is located inside an orbit equivalent to that of Venus. Yet, the two belts may have one important trait in common. In our solar system, Jupiter acts as an outer wall to the asteroid belt, shepherding its debris into a series of bands. Similarly, an unseen planet the size of Saturn or smaller may be marshalling this star's rubble. One of NASA's future planet-hunting missions, SIM PlanetQuest, may ultimately identify such a planet orbiting HD 69830.

Captured by Spitzer's infrared eyes, the majestic image resembles the iconic \"Pillars of Creation\" picture taken of the Eagle Nebula in visible light by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in 1995. Both views feature star-forming clouds of cool gas and dust that have been sculpted into pillars by radiation and winds from hot, massive stars. The Spitzer image shows the eastern edge of a region known as W5, in the Cassiopeia constellation 7,000 light-years away. This region is dominated by a single massive star, whose location outside the pictured area is \"pointed out\" by the finger-like pillars. The pillars themselves are colossal, together resembling a mountain range. They are more than 10 times the size of those in the Eagle Nebula. The largest of the pillars observed by Spitzer entombs hundreds of never-before-seen embryonic stars, and the second largest contains dozens. \"We believe that the star clusters lighting up the tips of the pillars are essentially the offspring of the region's single, massive star,\" said Dr. Lori Allen, lead investigator of the new observations, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass. \"It appears that radiation and winds from the massive star triggered new stars to form.\" Spitzer was able to see the stars forming inside the pillars thanks to its infrared vision. Visible-light images of this same region show dark towers outlined by halos of light. The stars inside are cloaked by walls of dust. But infrared light coming from these stars can escape through the dust, providing astronomers with a new view. \"With Spitzer, we can not only see the stars in the pillars, but we can estimate their age and study how they formed,\" said Dr. Joseph Hora, a co-investigator, also from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The W5 region and the Eagle Nebula are referred to as high-mass star-forming regions. They start out as thick and turbulent clouds of gas and dust that later give birth to families of stars, some of which are more than 10 times more massive than the sun. Radiation and winds from the massive stars subsequently blast the cloudy material outward, so that only the densest pillar-shaped clumps of material remain. The process is akin to the formation of desert mesas, which are made up of dense rock that resisted water and wind erosion. According to theories of triggered star formation, the pillars eventually become dense enough to spur the birth of a second generation of stars. Those stars, in turn, might also trigger successive generations. Astronomers do not know if the sun, which formed about five billion years ago, was originally a member of this type of extended stellar family.

The findings suggest the dead star, which most likely consumed its inner planets, is still orbited by a ring of surviving comets and possibly outer planets. This is the first observational evidence that comets can outlive their suns. \"Astronomers have known for decades that stars are born, have an extended middle age, and then wither away or explode. Spitzer is helping us understand how planetary systems evolve in tandem with their parent stars,\" said David Leisawitz, NASA's Spitzer program scientist. Astronomers believe white dwarfs are shrunken skeletons of stars that were once similar to Earth's sun. As the stars aged over billions of years, they grew brighter and eventually swelled in size to become red giants. Millions of years later, the red giants shed their outer atmospheres, leaving behind white dwarfs. If any planets did orbit in these systems, the red giants would have engulfed at least the inner ones. Only distant outer planets and an orbiting icy outpost of comets would have survived. \"The dust seen by Spitzer around G29-38 was probably generated relatively recently when one such outlying comet may have been knocked into the inner region of the system and ripped into dust shreds by the tidal forces of the star,\" said astronomer William Reach of the Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. Prior to the Spitzer findings, astronomers studying G29-38 noticed an unusual and unknown source of infrared light. Spitzer, with its powerful infrared spectrometer, was able to break this light apart, revealing its molecular makeup. These data told astronomers the light was coming from the same types of dusty minerals found in comets in our solar system. \"We detected a large quantity of very small, dirty silicate grains,\" said astronomer Marc Kuchner of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \"The size of these grains tells us they are probably from comets and not other planetary bodies.\" In our own solar system, comets reside in the cold outer fringes in regions known as the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. Only when something disturbs their orbits, such as another comet or an outer planet, do they begin periodic journeys into the sun's warmer neighborhood. However, these trips to the tropics often end in destruction. Comets slowly disintegrate as they pass close to the sun, or they crash into it. They also occasionally crash into planets, as comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 did when it plunged into Jupiter. Though the dust seen by Spitzer around the white dwarf is most likely the remains of such a torn-up comet, there may be other explanations.

The findings suggest the dead star, which most likely consumed its inner planets, is still orbited by a ring of surviving comets and possibly outer planets. This is the first observational evidence that comets can outlive their suns. \"Astronomers have known for decades that stars are born, have an extended middle age, and then wither away or explode. Spitzer is helping us understand how planetary systems evolve in tandem with their parent stars,\" said David Leisawitz, NASA's Spitzer program scientist. Astronomers believe white dwarfs are shrunken skeletons of stars that were once similar to Earth's sun. As the stars aged over billions of years, they grew brighter and eventually swelled in size to become red giants. Millions of years later, the red giants shed their outer atmospheres, leaving behind white dwarfs. If any planets did orbit in these systems, the red giants would have engulfed at least the inner ones. Only distant outer planets and an orbiting icy outpost of comets would have survived. \"The dust seen by Spitzer around G29-38 was probably generated relatively recently when one such outlying comet may have been knocked into the inner region of the system and ripped into dust shreds by the tidal forces of the star,\" said astronomer William Reach of the Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. Prior to the Spitzer findings, astronomers studying G29-38 noticed an unusual and unknown source of infrared light. Spitzer, with its powerful infrared spectrometer, was able to break this light apart, revealing its molecular makeup. These data told astronomers the light was coming from the same types of dusty minerals found in comets in our solar system. \"We detected a large quantity of very small, dirty silicate grains,\" said astronomer Marc Kuchner of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \"The size of these grains tells us they are probably from comets and not other planetary bodies.\" In our own solar system, comets reside in the cold outer fringes in regions known as the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. Only when something disturbs their orbits, such as another comet or an outer planet, do they begin periodic journeys into the sun's warmer neighborhood. However, these trips to the tropics often end in destruction. Comets slowly disintegrate as they pass close to the sun, or they crash into it. They also occasionally crash into planets, as comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 did when it plunged into Jupiter. Though the dust seen by Spitzer around the white dwarf is most likely the remains of such a torn-up comet, there may be other explanations. One possibility is that a second wave of planets formed long after the death of the star, leaving a dusty construction zone. Kuchner presented his findings today at the 207th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington. The data were also published in the December 20, 2005, issue of the Astrophysical Journal.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2006-04-nasas-spitzer-finds-possible-comet-dust-around-dead-star"}, {"title": "SSC Astronomer Discovers a River of Stars", "date": "2006-03-15", "content": "The California Institute of Technology announced today (March 15) that a team of astronomers, led by Carl Grillmair of the Spitzer Science Center, has discovered a narrow stream of stars extending at least 45 degrees across the northern sky.

Reach of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. Reach and his team recently observed the comet using Spitzer. Comet 73P/Schwassman-Wachmann 3 consists of a collection of fragments that file along like ducks in a row around the sun every 5.4 years. This year, the bunch will pass by Earth beginning on May 12 before swinging by the sun on June 6. The fragments won't get too close to Earth, about 7.3 million miles, or 30 times the distance between Earth and the moon, but they should be visible through binoculars in the countryside night skies. The icy comet began falling apart in 1995 during one of its tropical trips to the sun. Astronomers believe that its crusty outer layer cracked due to the heat, allowing fresh ice to evaporate and split the comet apart. During the past six weeks, amateur and professional astronomers have been watching the comet fall apart before their telescopes' eyes. Spitzer viewed the broken comet from its quiet perch up in space May 4 to May 6, covering a portion of the sky that allowed it to spot 45 of the 58 known fragments. The observatory's infrared view also provides the first look at the dusty trail left by the disintegrating comet after it splintered apart in 1995. The trail is made up of comet dust, pebbles and rocks that occasionally rain down on Earth in what is called the Tau Herculid meteor shower. From May 19 to June 19, as Earth passes through the outskirts of the trail, only a weak meteor shower is expected, with just a few \"shooting stars\" visible in the night sky. A larger meteor shower might occur in 2022 if Earth crosses near the comet's wake as predicted. Spitzer's infrared eyes were able to see the dusty comet bits lining the trail because the dust is warmed by sunlight and glows at infrared wavelengths. Most of the dust particles, specifically the millimeter-sized nuggets, had never been seen before. Reach said that these particles probably represent the natural deterioration of the comet over the years, a process commonly observed in intact comets. The comet dust also adds up to more evidence for the \"icy dirtball\" theory of comets. In recent years, more and more astronomers are coming to think of comets not as snowballs coated in dust, but as dirtballs crusted with ice. \"By measuring the brightness and extent of the debris trail, we are trying to find out whether most of the comet's mass disintegrates into vapors from evaporating ice, the house-sized chunks seen in images from the Hubble Space Telescope, or the meteor-sized debris seen in the Spitzer images,\" said Reach.

This \"hot-Jupiter\" planet is a gas giant similar to Jupiter, but it orbits very close to its scorching star, circling the star once every 4.6 days. Scientists believe the planet is tidally locked to its star. This means it is rotating slowly enough that the same side always faces the star, just as the same side of Earth's tidally locked moon always faces toward us, hiding its \"dark side.\" However, since this planet is made of gas, its outer atmosphere could be circulating much faster than its interior. According to the astronomers, the observed temperature difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b is extreme -- about 1,400 degrees Celsius (2,550 degrees Fahrenheit). Such a large temperature difference indicates the planet's atmosphere absorbs and reradiates sunlight so fast that gas circling around it cools off quickly. This is unlike Jupiter, which is even-temperatured all the way around. \"If you were moving across the planet from the night side to day side, the temperature jump would be equivalent to leaping into a volcano,\" said the project's principal investigator, Dr. Brad Hansen of the University of California, Los Angeles. Spitzer used its heat-seeking infrared eyes to periodically stare at the Upsilon Andromedae planetary system over approximately five days. It found the system's infrared light, or heat, dimmed and brightened in time with Upsilon Andromedae b's orbit. This change in heat is the result of the planet showing its different faces to Spitzer as it traveled around the star. When the planet's sunlit side was in Earth's view, Spitzer detected more heat from the system; when its dark side was facing us, it picked up less heat. The planet does not cross behind or in front of its star, but is always in Earth's line of sight. Upsilon Andromedae b was discovered in 1996 around the star Upsilon Andromedae, which is 40 light-years away and visible to the naked eye at night in the constellation Andromeda.

The fluffy-looking galaxy, officially named Messier 101, is dominated by a mishmash of spiral arms. In Spitzer's new view, in which infrared light is color coded, the galaxy sports a swirling blue center and a unique, coral-red outer ring. A new paper appearing July 20 in the Astrophysical Journal explains why this outer ring stands out. According to the authors, the red color highlights a zone where organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are present throughout most of the galaxy, suddenly disappear. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are dusty, carbon-containing molecules found in star nurseries, and on Earth in barbeque pits, exhaust pipes and anywhere combustion reactions take place. Scientists believe this space dust has the potential to be converted into the stuff of life. \"If you were going look for life in Messier 101, you would not want to look at its edges,\" said Karl Gordon of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. \"The organics can't survive in these regions, most likely because of high amounts of harsh radiation.\" The Pinwheel galaxy is located about 27 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It has one of the highest known gradients of metals (elements heavier than helium) of all nearby galaxies in our universe. In other words, its concentrations of metals are highest at its center, and decline rapidly with distance from the center. This is because stars, which produce metals, are squeezed more tightly into the galaxy's central quarters. Gordon and his team used Spitzer to learn about the galaxy's gradient of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The astronomers found that, like the metals, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons decrease in concentration toward the outer portion of the galaxy. But, unlike the metals, these organic molecules quickly drop off and are no longer detected at the very outer rim. \"There's a threshold at the rim of this galaxy, where the organic material is getting destroyed,\" said Gordon. The findings also provide a better understanding of the conditions under which the very first stars and galaxies arose. In the early universe, there were not a lot of metals or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons around. The outskirt of the Pinwheel galaxy therefore serves as a close-up example of what the environment might look like in a distant galaxy.

Within about a week of May 12, the telescope is expected to run out of the liquid helium needed to chill some of its instruments to operating temperatures. The end of the coolant will begin a new era for Spitzer. The telescope will start its \"warm\" mission with two channels of one instrument still working at full capacity. Some of the science explored by a warm Spitzer will be the same, and some will be entirely new. \"We like to think of Spitzer as being reborn,\" said Robert Wilson, Spitzer project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Spitzer led an amazing life, performing above and beyond its call of duty. Its primary mission might be over, but it will tackle new scientific pursuits, and more breakthroughs are sure to come.\" Spitzer is the last of NASA's Great Observatories, a suite of telescopes designed to see the visible and invisible colors of the universe. The suite also includes NASA's Hubble and Chandra space telescopes. Spitzer has explored, with unprecedented sensitivity, the infrared side of the cosmos, where dark, dusty and distant objects hide. For a telescope to detect infrared light - essentially heat - from cool cosmic objects, it must have very little heat of its own. During the past five years, liquid helium has run through Spitzer's \"veins,\" keeping its three instruments chilled to -456 degrees Fahrenheit (-271 Celsius), or less than 3 degrees above absolute zero, the coldest temperature theoretically attainable. The cryogen was projected to last as little as two and a half years, but Spitzer's efficient design and careful operations enabled it to last more than five and a half years. Spitzer's new \"warm\" temperature is still quite chilly at -404 degrees Fahrenheit (-242 Celsius) - much colder than a winter day in Antarctica when temperatures sometimes reach -75 degrees Fahrenheit (-59 Celsius). This temperature rise means two of Spitzer's instruments - its longer wavelength multiband imaging photometer and its infrared spectrograph - will no longer be cold enough to detect cool objects in space. However, the telescope's two shortest-wavelength detectors in its infrared array camera will continue to function perfectly. They will still pick up the glow from a range of objects: asteroids in our solar system, dusty stars, planet-forming disks, gas-giant planets and distant galaxies. In addition, Spitzer still will be able to see through the dust that permeates our galaxy and blocks visible-light views. \"We will do exciting and important science with these two infrared channels,\" said Spitzer Project Scientist Michael Werner of JPL. Werner has been working on Spitzer for more than 30 years. \"Our new science program takes advantage of what these channels do best. We're focusing on aspects of the cosmos that we still have much to learn about.\" Since its launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Aug. 25, 2003, Spitzer has made countless breakthroughs in astronomy. Observations of comets both near and far have established that the stuff of comets and planets is similar throughout the galaxy. Breathtaking photos of dusty stellar nests have led to new insights into how stars are born. And Spitzer's eye on the very distant universe, billions of light-years away, has revealed hundreds of massive black holes lurking in the dark. Perhaps the most revolutionary and surprising Spitzer finds involve planets around other stars, called exoplanets. Exoplanets are, in almost all cases, too close to their parent stars to be seen from our Earthly point of view. Nevertheless, planet hunters continue to uncover them by looking for changes in the parent stars. Before Spitzer, everything we knew about exoplanets came from indirect observations such as these. In 2005, Spitzer detected the first light, or photons, from an exoplanet. In a clever technique, now referred to as the secondary-eclipse method, Spitzer was able to collect the light of a hot, gaseous exoplanet and learn about its temperature. Further detailed spectroscopic studies later revealed more about the atmospheres, or \"weather,\" on similar planets. More recently, Spitzer witnessed changes in the weather on a wildly eccentric gas exoplanet - a storm of colossal proportions brewing up in a matter of hours before quickly settling down. \"Nobody had any idea Spitzer would be able to directly study exoplanets when we designed it,\" Werner said. \"When astronomers planned the first observations, we had no idea if they would work. To our amazement and delight, they did.\" These are a few of Spitzer's achievements during the past five and a half years. Data from the telescope are cited in more than 1,500 scientific papers. And scientists and engineers expect the rewards to keep on coming during Spitzer's golden years. Some of Spitzer's new pursuits include refining estimates of Hubble's constant, or the rate at which our universe is stretching apart; searching for galaxies at the edge of the universe; assessing how often potentially hazardous asteroids might impact Earth by measuring the sizes of asteroids; and characterizing the atmospheres of gas-giant planets expected to be discovered soon by NASA's Kepler mission.

The end of the coolant will begin a new era for Spitzer. The telescope will start its \"warm\" mission with two channels of one instrument still working at full capacity. Some of the science explored by a warm Spitzer will be the same, and some will be entirely new. \"We like to think of Spitzer as being reborn,\" said Robert Wilson, Spitzer project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Spitzer led an amazing life, performing above and beyond its call of duty. Its primary mission might be over, but it will tackle new scientific pursuits, and more breakthroughs are sure to come.\" Spitzer is the last of NASA's Great Observatories, a suite of telescopes designed to see the visible and invisible colors of the universe. The suite also includes NASA's Hubble and Chandra space telescopes. Spitzer has explored, with unprecedented sensitivity, the infrared side of the cosmos, where dark, dusty and distant objects hide. For a telescope to detect infrared light - essentially heat - from cool cosmic objects, it must have very little heat of its own. During the past five years, liquid helium has run through Spitzer's \"veins,\" keeping its three instruments chilled to -456 degrees Fahrenheit (-271 Celsius), or less than 3 degrees above absolute zero, the coldest temperature theoretically attainable. The cryogen was projected to last as little as two and a half years, but Spitzer's efficient design and careful operations enabled it to last more than five and a half years. Spitzer's new \"warm\" temperature is still quite chilly at -404 degrees Fahrenheit (-242 Celsius) - much colder than a winter day in Antarctica when temperatures sometimes reach -75 degrees Fahrenheit (-59 Celsius). This temperature rise means two of Spitzer's instruments - its longer wavelength multiband imaging photometer and its infrared spectrograph - will no longer be cold enough to detect cool objects in space. However, the telescope's two shortest-wavelength detectors in its infrared array camera will continue to function perfectly. They will still pick up the glow from a range of objects: asteroids in our solar system, dusty stars, planet-forming disks, gas-giant planets and distant galaxies. In addition, Spitzer still will be able to see through the dust that permeates our galaxy and blocks visible-light views. \"We will do exciting and important science with these two infrared channels,\" said Spitzer Project Scientist Michael Werner of JPL. Werner has been working on Spitzer for more than 30 years. \"Our new science program takes advantage of what these channels do best. We're focusing on aspects of the cosmos that we still have much to learn about.\" Since its launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Aug. 25, 2003, Spitzer has made countless breakthroughs in astronomy. Observations of comets both near and far have established that the stuff of comets and planets is similar throughout the galaxy. Breathtaking photos of dusty stellar nests have led to new insights into how stars are born. And Spitzer's eye on the very distant universe, billions of light-years away, has revealed hundreds of massive black holes lurking in the dark. Perhaps the most revolutionary and surprising Spitzer finds involve planets around other stars, called exoplanets. Exoplanets are, in almost all cases, too close to their parent stars to be seen from our Earthly point of view. Nevertheless, planet hunters continue to uncover them by looking for changes in the parent stars. Before Spitzer, everything we knew about exoplanets came from indirect observations such as these. In 2005, Spitzer detected the first light, or photons, from an exoplanet. In a clever technique, now referred to as the secondary-eclipse method, Spitzer was able to collect the light of a hot, gaseous exoplanet and learn about its temperature. Further detailed spectroscopic studies later revealed more about the atmospheres, or \"weather,\" on similar planets. More recently, Spitzer witnessed changes in the weather on a wildly eccentric gas exoplanet - a storm of colossal proportions brewing up in a matter of hours before quickly settling down. \"Nobody had any idea Spitzer would be able to directly study exoplanets when we designed it,\" Werner said. \"When astronomers planned the first observations, we had no idea if they would work. To our amazement and delight, they did.\" These are a few of Spitzer's achievements during the past five and a half years. Data from the telescope are cited in more than 1,500 scientific papers. And scientists and engineers expect the rewards to keep on coming during Spitzer's golden years. Some of Spitzer's new pursuits include refining estimates of Hubble's constant, or the rate at which our universe is stretching apart; searching for galaxies at the edge of the universe; assessing how often potentially hazardous asteroids might impact Earth by measuring the sizes of asteroids; and characterizing the atmospheres of gas-giant planets expected to be discovered soon by NASA's Kepler mission. As was true during the cold Spitzer mission, these and the other programs are selected through a competition in which scientists from around the world are invited to participate.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2009-10-nasas-spitzer-telescope-warms-up-to-new-career"}, {"title": "NASA's Spitzer Begins Warm Mission", "date": "2009-05-15", "content": "After more than five-and-a-half years of probing the cool cosmos, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has run out of the coolant that kept its infrared instruments chilled.

This doesn't mean that the telescope is nearing the end of its life; rather, it merely switches the mission from the \"cold\" phase it has been in since launch to a new \"warm\" phase, with new scientific objectives. This is actually a big week for infrared astronomy. The European Space Agency launched two space-based IR telescopes of its own, the Herschel Space Observatory (HSO) and the Planck mission. The HSO is armed with the largest mirror ever put into space, at 3.5m, approximately four times the size of Spitzer's. It's carrying three years' worth of coolant that will allow it to image deeper into the infrared, pushing close to radio astronomy wavelengths. With the Spitzer now shifting to the shorter-wavelength ranges of the IR, the HSO and Spitzer missions will largely complement each other.

New images taken with two of Spitzer's infrared detector channels-two that work at the new, warmer temperature-demonstrate the observatory remains a powerful tool for probing the dusty universe. The images show a bustling star-forming region, the remains of a star similar to the sun, and a swirling galaxy lined with stars. \"The performance of the two short wavelength channels of Spitzer's infrared array camera is essentially unchanged from what it was before the observatory's liquid helium was exhausted,\" said Doug Hudgins, the Spitzer program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"To put that in perspective, that means Spitzer's sensitivity at those wavelengths is still roughly the same as a 30-meter ground-based telescope. These breathtaking images demonstrate Spitzer will continue to deliver world-class imagery and science during its warm mission.\" The first of three images shows a cloud bursting with stars in the Cygnus region of our Milky Way galaxy.

They include planet-forming disks around stars, the composition of the material making up comets, hidden black holes, galaxies billions of light-years away and more. Perhaps the most revolutionary and surprising Spitzer finds involve planets around other stars, called exoplanets. In 2005, Spitzer detected the first photons of light from an exoplanet. In a clever technique, now referred to as the secondary-eclipse method, Spitzer was able to collect the light of a hot, gaseous exoplanet and learn about its temperature. Later detailed studies revealed more about the composition and structure of the atmospheres of these exotic worlds. Warm Spitzer will address many of the same science questions as before. It also will tackle new projects, such as refining estimates of Hubble's constant, or the rate at which our universe is stretching apart; searching for galaxies at the edge of the universe; characterizing more than 700 near-Earth objects, or asteroids and comets with orbits that pass close to our planet; and studying the atmospheres of giant gas planets expected to be discovered soon by NASA's Kepler mission. As during the cold Spitzer mission, these and the other programs are selected by a competition in which scientists from around the world are invited to participate. Spitzer officially began its warm science mission on July 27, 2009.

Within about a week of May 12, the telescope is expected to run out of the liquid helium needed to chill some of its instruments to operating temperatures. The end of the coolant will begin a new era for Spitzer. The telescope will start its \"warm\" mission with two channels of one instrument still working at full capacity. Some of the science explored by a warm Spitzer will be the same, and some will be entirely new. \"We like to think of Spitzer as being reborn,\" said Robert Wilson, Spitzer project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Spitzer led an amazing life, performing above and beyond its call of duty. Its primary mission might be over, but it will tackle new scientific pursuits, and more breakthroughs are sure to come.\" Spitzer is the last of NASA's Great Observatories, a suite of telescopes designed to see the visible and invisible colors of the universe. The suite also includes NASA's Hubble and Chandra space telescopes. Spitzer has explored, with unprecedented sensitivity, the infrared side of the cosmos, where dark, dusty and distant objects hide. For a telescope to detect infrared light - essentially heat - from cool cosmic objects, it must have very little heat of its own. During the past five years, liquid helium has run through Spitzer's \"veins,\" keeping its three instruments chilled to -456 degrees Fahrenheit (-271 Celsius), or less than 3 degrees above absolute zero, the coldest temperature theoretically attainable. The cryogen was projected to last as little as two and a half years, but Spitzer's efficient design and careful operations enabled it to last more than five and a half years. Spitzer's new \"warm\" temperature is still quite chilly at -404 degrees Fahrenheit (-242 Celsius) - much colder than a winter day in Antarctica when temperatures sometimes reach -75 degrees Fahrenheit (-59 Celsius). This temperature rise means two of Spitzer's instruments - its longer wavelength multiband imaging photometer and its infrared spectrograph - will no longer be cold enough to detect cool objects in space. However, the telescope's two shortest-wavelength detectors in its infrared array camera will continue to function perfectly. They will still pick up the glow from a range of objects: asteroids in our solar system, dusty stars, planet-forming disks, gas-giant planets and distant galaxies. In addition, Spitzer still will be able to see through the dust that permeates our galaxy and blocks visible-light views. \"We will do exciting and important science with these two infrared channels,\" said Spitzer Project Scientist Michael Werner of JPL. Werner has been working on Spitzer for more than 30 years. \"Our new science program takes advantage of what these channels do best. We're focusing on aspects of the cosmos that we still have much to learn about.\" Since its launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Aug. 25, 2003, Spitzer has made countless breakthroughs in astronomy. Observations of comets both near and far have established that the stuff of comets and planets is similar throughout the galaxy. Breathtaking photos of dusty stellar nests have led to new insights into how stars are born. And Spitzer's eye on the very distant universe, billions of light-years away, has revealed hundreds of massive black holes lurking in the dark. Perhaps the most revolutionary and surprising Spitzer finds involve planets around other stars, called exoplanets. Exoplanets are, in almost all cases, too close to their parent stars to be seen from our Earthly point of view. Nevertheless, planet hunters continue to uncover them by looking for changes in the parent stars. Before Spitzer, everything we knew about exoplanets came from indirect observations such as these. In 2005, Spitzer detected the first light, or photons, from an exoplanet. In a clever technique, now referred to as the secondary-eclipse method, Spitzer was able to collect the light of a hot, gaseous exoplanet and learn about its temperature. Further detailed spectroscopic studies later revealed more about the atmospheres, or \"weather,\" on similar planets. More recently, Spitzer witnessed changes in the weather on a wildly eccentric gas exoplanet - a storm of colossal proportions brewing up in a matter of hours before quickly settling down. \"Nobody had any idea Spitzer would be able to directly study exoplanets when we designed it,\" Werner said. \"When astronomers planned the first observations, we had no idea if they would work. To our amazement and delight, they did.\" These are a few of Spitzer's achievements during the past five and a half years. Data from the telescope are cited in more than 1,500 scientific papers. And scientists and engineers expect the rewards to keep on coming during Spitzer's golden years. Some of Spitzer's new pursuits include refining estimates of Hubble's constant, or the rate at which our universe is stretching apart; searching for galaxies at the edge of the universe; assessing how often potentially hazardous asteroids might impact Earth by measuring the sizes of asteroids; and characterizing the atmospheres of gas-giant planets expected to be discovered soon by NASA's Kepler mission.

As expected, on May 15th, 2009, the Spitzer Space Telescope ran out of its liquid helium coolant that has enabled it to observe dark, cold objects both within and outside of the solar system with ultra-high sensitivity. This doesn't mean that the telescope is nearing the end of its life; rather, it merely switches the mission from the \"cold\" phase it has been in since launch to a new \"warm\" phase, with new scientific objectives. This is actually a big week for infrared astronomy. The European Space Agency launched two space-based IR telescopes of its own, the Herschel Space Observatory (HSO) and the Planck mission. The HSO is armed with the largest mirror ever put into space, at 3.5m, approximately four times the size of Spitzer's. It's carrying three years' worth of coolant that will allow it to image deeper into the infrared, pushing close to radio astronomy wavelengths. With the Spitzer now shifting to the shorter-wavelength ranges of the IR, the HSO and Spitzer missions will largely complement each other. The Planck satellite also observes in the far-infrared, but its goal is to measure the cosmic microwave background radiation. Both HSO and Planck are on a four-month trip to the L2 Lagrange point, during which time ESA scientists should have the chance to calibrate their instruments.", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/05/spitzer-space-telescope-starts-a-new-life/"}, {"title": "Spitzer Status Update", "date": "2009-05-28", "content": "Characterization activities for NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope continue, a process that began after its cryogen ran out on May 15.

The nitrogen thrusters are used as required to release the solar pressure that builds momentum on the spacecraft's reaction control wheels. These wheels are used to slew and point the spacecraft toward observation targets. The process of releasing the wheel momentum is called desaturation. Since May 2009, engineers noticed that when thruster #6 was used for desaturation, the wheels were not actually being desaturated. Only recently was the degradation becoming significant enough that the team decided action was needed. In the future, if a problem should arise with the backup thrusters, then the fault protection would automatically swap back to the main, fully redundant thruster string.

Buckyballs are soccer-ball-shaped molecules that were first observed in a laboratory 25 years ago. They are named for their resemblance to architect Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes, which have interlocking circles on the surface of a partial sphere. Buckyballs were thought to float around in space, but had escaped detection until now. \"We found what are now the largest molecules known to exist in space,\" said astronomer Jan Cami of the University of Western Ontario, Canada, and the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif. \"We are particularly excited because they have unique properties that make them important players for all sorts of physical and chemical processes going on in space.\" Cami has authored a paper about the discovery that will appear online Thursday in the journal Science. Buckyballs are made of 60 carbon atoms arranged in three-dimensional, spherical structures. Their alternating patterns of hexagons and pentagons match a typical black-and-white soccer ball. The research team also found the more elongated relative of buckyballs, known as C70, for the first time in space. These molecules consist of 70 carbon atoms and are shaped more like an oval rugby ball. Both types of molecules belong to a class known officially as buckminsterfullerenes, or fullerenes. The Cami team unexpectedly found the carbon balls in a planetary nebula named Tc 1. Planetary nebulas are the remains of stars, like the sun, that shed their outer layers of gas and dust as they age. A compact, hot star, or white dwarf, at the center of the nebula illuminates and heats these clouds of material that has been shed. The buckyballs were found in these clouds, perhaps reflecting a short stage in the star's life, when it sloughs off a puff of material rich in carbon. The astronomers used Spitzer's spectroscopy instrument to analyze infrared light from the planetary nebula and see the spectral signatures of the buckyballs. These molecules are approximately room temperature -- the ideal temperature to give off distinct patterns of infrared light that Spitzer can detect. According to Cami, Spitzer looked at the right place at the right time. A century from now, the buckyballs might be too cool to be detected. The data from Spitzer were compared with data from laboratory measurements of the same molecules and showed a perfect match. \"We did not plan for this discovery,\" Cami said. \"But when we saw these whopping spectral signatures, we knew immediately that we were looking at one of the most sought-after molecules.\" In 1970, Japanese professor Eiji Osawa predicted the existence of buckyballs, but they were not observed until lab experiments in 1985. Researchers simulated conditions in the atmospheres of aging, carbon-rich giant stars, in which chains of carbon had been detected. Surprisingly, these experiments resulted in the formation of large quantities of buckminsterfullerenes. The molecules have since been found on Earth in candle soot, layers of rock and meteorites. The study of fullerenes and their relatives has grown into a busy field of research because of the molecules' unique strength and exceptional chemical and physical properties. Among the potential applications are armor, drug delivery and superconducting technologies.", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/ssc2010-06-nasa-telescope-finds-elusive-buckyballs-in-space-for-first-time"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Telescope Finds Elusive Buckyballs in Space for First Time", "date": "2010-07-22", "content": "Astronomers using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope have discovered carbon molecules, known as \"buckyballs,\" in space for the first time.

One additional task is helping NASA observe potential candidates for a developing mission to capture, redirect, and explore a near-Earth asteroid. \"President Obama's goal of visiting an asteroid by 2025 combines NASA's diverse talents in a unified endeavor,\" said John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science in Washington, D.C. \"Using Spitzer to help us characterize asteroids and potential targets for an asteroid mission advances both science and exploration.\" ", "url": "https://astronomy.com/news/2013/08/spitzer-telescope-celebrates-10-years-in-space"}, {"title": "Incredible photos from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope", "date": "2013-08-27", "content": "A cluster brimming with millions of stars glistens like an iridescent opal.

The discovery demonstrates that Spitzer -- from its unique perch in space -- can be used to help solve the puzzle of how planets are distributed throughout our flat, spiral-shaped Milky Way galaxy. Are they concentrated heavily in its central hub, or more evenly spread throughout its suburbs? \"We don't know if planets are more common in our galaxy's central bulge or the disk of the galaxy, which is why these observations are so important,\" said Jennifer Yee of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a NASA Sagan fellow. Yee is the lead author of one of three new studies that appeared recently in the Astrophysical Journal describing a collaboration between astronomers using Spitzer and the Polish Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE. OGLE's Warsaw Telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile scans the skies for planets using a method called microlensing. A microlensing event occurs when one star happens to pass in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star's light. If that foreground star happens to have a planet in orbit around it, the planet might cause a blip in the magnification. Astronomers are using these blips to find and characterize planets tens of thousands of light-years away in the central bulge of our galaxy, where star crossings are more common. Our sun is located in the suburbs of the galaxy, about two-thirds of the way out from the center. The microlensing technique as a whole has yielded about 30 planet discoveries so far, with the farthest residing about 25,000 light-years away. \"Microlensing experiments are already detecting planets from the solar neighborhood to almost the center of the Milky Way,\" said co-author Andrew Gould of The Ohio State University, Columbus. \"And so they can, in principle, tell us the relative efficiency of planet formation across this huge expanse of our galaxy.\" Microlensing complements other planet-hunting tools, such as NASA's Kepler mission, which has found more than 1,000 planets closer to home. But it faces one key problem: This method can't always precisely narrow down the distance to the stars and planets being observed. While a passing star may magnify the light of a more distant star, it rarely can be seen itself, making the task of measuring how far away it is challenging. Of the approximately 30 planets discovered with microlensing so far, roughly half cannot be pinned down to a precise location. The result is like a planetary treasure map lacking in X's. That's where Spitzer can help out, thanks to its remote Earth-trailing orbit. Spitzer circles our sun, and is currently about 128 million miles (207 million kilometers) away from Earth. That's farther from Earth than Earth is from our sun. When Spitzer watches a microlensing event simultaneously with a telescope on Earth, it sees the star brighten at a different time, due to the large distance between the two telescopes and their unique vantage points. This technique is generally referred to as parallax. \"Spitzer is the first space telescope to make a microlens parallax measurement for a planet,\" said Yee. \"Traditional parallax techniques that employ ground-based telescopes are not as effective at such great distances.\" Using space telescopes to observe microlensing events is tricky. Ground telescopes send out alerts to the astronomy community when an event starts, but the activity can quickly fade, lasting on average about 40 days. The Spitzer team has scrambled to start microlensing campaigns as soon as three days after receiving an alert. In the case of the newfound planet, the duration of the microlensing event happened to be unusually long, about 150 days. Both Spitzer and OGLE's telescopes detected the telltale planetary blip in the magnification, with Spitzer seeing it 20 days earlier. This time delay between viewing of the event by OGLE and Spitzer was used to calculate the distance to the star and its planet. Knowing the distance allowed the scientists also to determine the mass of the planet, which is about half that of Jupiter. Spitzer has eyed 22 other microlensing events in collaboration with OGLE and several other ground-based telescopes. While these observations have not turned up new planets, the data are essential to learning the population statistics of stars and planets at the heart of our galaxy.

This Beyond phase of the Spitzer mission will explore a wide range of topics in astronomy and cosmology, as well as planetary bodies in and out of our solar system. Because of Spitzer's orbit and age, the Beyond phase presents a variety of new engineering challenges. Spitzer trails Earth in its journey around the sun, but because the spacecraft travels slower than Earth, the distance between Spitzer and Earth has widened over time. As Spitzer gets farther away, its antenna must be pointed at higher angles toward the sun to communicate with Earth, which means that parts of the spacecraft will experience more and more heat. At the same time, Spitzer's solar panels point away from the sun and will receive less sunlight, so the batteries will be under greater stress. To enable this riskier mode of operations, the mission team will have to override some autonomous safety systems. \"Balancing these concerns on a heat-sensitive spacecraft will be a delicate dance, but engineers are hard at work preparing for the new challenges in the Beyond phase,\" said Mark Effertz, the Spitzer spacecraft chief engineer at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Littleton, Colorado, which built the spacecraft. Spitzer, which launched on Aug. 25, 2003, has consistently adapted to new scientific and engineering challenges during its mission, and the team expects it will continue to do so during the \"Beyond\" phase, which begins Oct. 1. The selected research proposals for the Beyond phase, also known as Cycle 13, include a variety of objects that Spitzer wasn't originally planned to address -- such as galaxies in the early universe, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way and exoplanets. \"We never even considered using Spitzer for studying exoplanets when it launched,\" said Sean Carey of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at Caltech in Pasadena. \"It would have seemed ludicrous back then, but now it's an important part of what Spitzer does.\"", "url": "https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/feature16-13-spitzer-space-telescope-begins-beyond-phase"}, {"title": "Spitzer Space Telescope: Scanning the Skies in Infrared", "date": "2016-08-30", "content": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope observed the universe in infrared light for more than 16 years, from shortly after its launch in 2003 until its long- extended mission was shut down by flight controllers in 2020.

Spitzer trails Earth in its journey around the sun, but because the spacecraft travels slower than Earth, the distance between Spitzer and Earth has widened over time. As Spitzer gets farther away, its antenna must be pointed at higher angles toward the sun to communicate with Earth, which means that parts of the spacecraft will experience more and more heat. At the same time, Spitzer's solar panels point away from the sun and will receive less sunlight, so the batteries will be under greater stress.

It also carried coolant to keep its instrumentation chilled, though it needed less than previous telescopes due to its clever design and orbit.
