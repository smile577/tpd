But the project's member states have yet to make a final decision on where the telescope will go. The SKA Site Advisory Committee's decision was first reported on 10 March in the Sydney Morning Herald. A source familiar with the site-selection process confirmed to Nature that the panel had indeed made a decision, but added that it was a close call. \"This is not an enormous preference for one over the other,\" he says. The US$2.1-billion SKA radio telescope will be made up of some 3,000 dishes, each 15 metres in diameter. The project will try to answer big questions about the early Universe: how the first elements heavier than helium formed, for example, and how the first galaxies coalesced. The telescope is so sensitive that it could even pick up television signals from distant worlds - something that might aid in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Since 2006, South Africa has competed against a joint bid from Australia and New Zealand to host the project. The South African site has some compelling advantages: construction costs are lower, and it sits at a higher altitude. But the Australian site would be cheaper to insure, and is less likely to be encroached on by future development. The margin in favour of the winner was extremely narrow, the source says. Members of the SKA's board will meet on 19 March in Manchester, UK, to discuss the scientific panel's recommendations. The closed meeting will also provide the two bidders with the opportunity to contest any of the panel's recommendations. After the meeting, the SKA's board will write a commentary to accompany the recommendation, which will inform the final decision. According to Nature's source, because the two sites are so close in merit, both are still in contention. China, Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands - the SKA voting board members - could yet decide either way. It is even possible that the array could be shared between both nations, although this would probably increase the construction costs. A final site decision could come as soon as 4 April, when a meeting of the board is tentatively scheduled in Amsterdam.

The nations belonging to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) organisation took the decision at a meeting on Friday. The 1.5bn-euro (\u00a31.2bn) SKA's huge fields of antennas will sweep the sky for answers to the major outstanding questions in astronomy. They will probe the early Universe, test Einstein's theory of gravity and even search for alien intelligent life. The project aims to produce a radio telescope with a combined collecting area of one million square metres - equivalent to about 200 football pitches. To do this, it will have to combine the signals received by thousands of small antennas spread over thousands of kilometres. Sharing the wealth: South Africa and Australasia had put forward separate, competing bids, and the early indications had been that there would be one outright winner. But the SKA organisation decided both proposals should contribute something to the final design of the telescope. \"We have decided on a dual site approach,\" said SKA board chairman Prof John Womersley. He was speaking at a news conference held at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport following a meeting of the organisation's members in the Dutch capital. The decision to use two sites will undoubtedly increase the cost and complexity of the SKA. Its targets will be radio sources in the sky that radiate at centimetre to metre wavelengths. These include the clouds of hydrogen gas in the infant Universe that collapsed to form the very first stars and galaxies. The SKA will map precisely the positions of the nearest billion galaxies. The structure they trace on the cosmos should reveal new details about \"dark energy\", the mysterious negative pressure that appears to be pushing the Universe apart at an ever-increasing speed. The telescope will also detail the influence of magnetic fields on the development of stars and galaxies. And it will zoom in on pulsars, the dead stars that emit beams of radio waves that sweep across the Earth like super-accurate time signals. Astronomers believe these dense objects may hold the key to a more complete theory of gravity than that proposed by Einstein. Different strengths: The Australasian bid was centred on a site at Boolardy Station, about 500km (310 miles) north of Perth in Western Australia. For South Africa, the central location put forward was in the Karoo in the Northern Cape, about 95km from Carnarvon. Both have exceptional conditions for radio astronomy in that, being remote territories, they experience very little stray interference from cellular phone networks and TV broadcasts. And Australia and South Africa had even started building precursor facilities which they hoped would enhance their bids' attractiveness. Both these pathfinders, known as ASKAP (Australia) and Meerkat (South Africa), will now be incorporated into the early development of the network. Most of the subsequent telescope dishes and mid-frequency aperture arrays will then be built in southern Africa (sites will include Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, Kenya, Zambia, and even out into the Indian Ocean in Mauritius and Madagascar) - the bulk of the SKA. The low-frequency aperture array antennas will be positioned in Australia. Prof Bryan Gaensler, from Sydney University and a former project scientist on the SKA, commented: \"What the SKA project has decided is to put different technologies in different places, playing to the strengths of each site.\" And Prof Womersley told BBC News: \"The important aspect of doing it this way is that we will get more science out of the project in the first phase by taking advantage of the existing ASKAP and Meerkat investments. So, while there'll be some additional operating costs associated with this implementation, we will get more science in return.\" Dr Bernie Fanaroff, the SKA South Africa project director, expressed his delight at the news. \"I think it's wonderful,\" he said. \"It means that for the first time in our history, Africa will be the host to the world's largest scientific instrument.

Designs for the world's largest radio telescope have been scaled back to save money - a decision that astronomers say could affect its ability to peer deep into the Universe's past. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a telescope 50 times more sensitive than current instruments, is expected to cost billions of dollars. Its final design calls for around 2,000 radio dishes in Africa, together with up to one million antennas in Australia, that will have a total light-collecting area of roughly 1 square kilometre - hence the project's name. But the first phase of construction, called SKA1, is a more modest affair. Already slimmed down from a larger design proposed in 2013, it now comprises 194 dishes in South Africa and around 130,000 antennas in Australia. In March, the SKA's board said that the project would have to find further cuts of around 20% so that it could be built within a \u20ac674 million (US$785 million) cap imposed by the project's ten funders - Australia, Canada, China, India, Italy, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. And at a meeting in the Netherlands on 18-19 July the board decided to make the savings by, among other measures, scaling back SKA1's computing power and crowding its antennas and radio dishes closer together. It's the latter idea that concerns astronomers the most. Packing the telescope's individual components into a smaller space will mean a loss of resolution, making SKA1 less able to pick up on fine details. In most cases this change won't seriously affect the array's scientific projects, says Tony Beasley, an astronomer and head of the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia. But Heino Falcke, an astronomer at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, says that it may have an impact on the project's ability to detect faint signals emanating from a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, when the Universe's first stars and galaxies formed and began to emit light. These low-frequency radio waves are to be picked up by the Australian antennas. And under the new cuts, clusters of these antennas - known as low-frequency stations - will now be placed a maximum of 40 kilometres apart, rather than 65. With inferior resolution, the telescope could struggle to pick up low-frequency radio waves over the noise of the Milky Way, says Falcke. The cost of change: Astronomers were consulted about the changes at a meeting in Manchester, UK, in June. But since then, they have grown more concerned about the idea of crowding the Australian stations closer together. So the board's decision may not be final: SKA working groups are still running simulations to work out the impact of the change, says Philip Diamond, the director-general of the SKA Organisation at the Jodrell Bank Observatory near Manchester. Once construction starts on the antennas, it would be difficult and expensive to change the distances between them, says Roy Maartens, an astronomer at the University of the Western Cape in Bellville, South Africa. But if the SKA board can find some additional funding in the next two years, the design change could be rolled back. Moving the antenna clusters a more comfortable 50 kilometres apart, for instance, would only add another \u20ac14 million to the budget, Diamond says. \"This is at the top of our list of things to restore once more funding becomes available.\" Astronomers are less worried about the decrease in computing power, from 260 petaflops to 50 petaflops, says Falcke. Although this means it will take longer to process data, the limiting factor for translating SKA1's observations into images will be ironing out initial problems with software and algorithms. By the time they're sorted, the project will be looking to upgrade to a new generation of computers anyway, he says. The cuts are a \"sensible compromise\", given the funds available, says Huib Jan van Langevelde, an astronomer who heads Europe's Joint Institute for Very Long Baseline Interferometry in Dwingeloo, the Netherlands. \"The bottom line is the SKA1 will still be doing transformational science,\" says Maartens. Diamond says he hopes that more countries can be persuaded to join the SKA project and inject extra funding, or that existing members will bring more money to the table. But some astronomers are not convinced that will happen. \"In this environment, where they are continuously back-pedalling, are major partners going to come forward?\" says one astronomer who asked not to be named. After delays caused by choosing what to cut in SKA1's design, construction is set to begin in mid-2019. But the SKA still lacks an intergovernmental organization to run it. Diamond says that a treaty to create such an organization should be ready this year, and all member countries will need to ratify it before construction starts.

In an important engineering milestone, a full station of 256 low-frequency antennas has been deployed and is undergoing tests at CSIRO's Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in outback Western Australia. The demonstrator, known as the Aperture Array Verification System (AAVS1) is being used to help test and finalise the design of the low frequency antennas for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), known as SKA-low. It was installed by an international team from Australia, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom over many months, sometimes in harsh conditions. \"This is a significant achievement by the team, they have done a fantastic job. We have been thinking, discussing and designing together for several years. Putting together and testing this verification system has been an amazing experience.\" said AAVS1 Project Manager Pieter Benthem. Benthem is based at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON), the institute that leads the consortium working on the design of the SKA-low telescope. The work is part of a global effort by 12 international engineering consortia representing 500 engineers and scientists in 20 countries. Nine of the consortia focus on a component of the telescope, each critical to the overall success of the project, while three others focus on developing advanced instrumentation for the telescope. After four years of intense design work, the nine consortia are having their Critical Design Review or CDR in 2018. In this final stage, the proposed design must meet the project's tough engineering requirements to be approved, so that a construction proposal for the telescope can be developed. The consortium focusing on SKA-low is now working towards its critical design review later this year. \"There's still a lot of work to be done, but the lessons we've learnt from AAVS1 will be fed into the larger design process for SKA-low\" said ICRAR Associate Professor Randall Wayth. \"The antennas used for AAVS1 are what we call second generation prototypes. The tests now being conducted on them are helping predict how the fourth generation will behave. It's all about making sure we get the best possible hardware on site at the end\" explains Phil Gibbs, SKA Organisation's Project Manager for the consortium. \"The next steps will be to complete the tests, interpret the results so they can feed into the proposed design for the SKA low telescope and prepare for the critical design review, which is anticipated to take place later this year\" he added. For the teams that have been involved in the work, seeing a completed prototype on site in the Australian outback is a great achievement after many years of work. \"This is the first time that I'm involved in such a big project, so for me it's a great experience\" said Marco Poloni, an engineer from INAF in Italy who has been part of the installation campaign.

The AIV Consortium, led by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO), was responsible for detailing the integration & verification process for the SKA's low-frequency telescope (SKA-low) in Australia and mid-frequency telescope (SKA-mid) in South Africa. Based on the principle of integrating early and often, the consortium has set out how and when the many different telescope components from all over the world will arrive and be put together at both the SKA sites. The approach that was followed allows the AIV team to identify problems at an early stage and thereby mitigate risks as early and efficiently as possible. Planning the integration of South Africa's SKA precursor telescope MeerKAT into SKA-mid was a key part of this work. All of the interfaces between MeerKAT components and SKA-mid components had to be identified and described. \"With MeerKAT we're talking about 64 dishes that are already operational, with a different design to the SKA dishes, so it's a huge challenge,\" said Peter Hekman, SKA Engineering Project Manager for AIV. \"Integration isn't just about plugging things in and pressing 'go', it's about ensuring components developed and manufactured by different teams all over the world fit together correctly, communicate, and behave seamlessly as one telescope.\" The consortium's verification planning work includes all the activities that are required to integrate the hardware and software components designed by the SKA's other engineering consortia into a cohesive instrument that meets the system requirements, so that the SKA's ambitious science goals can be achieved. The sheer scale and complexity of the SKA made AIV planning at an early stage essential. \"We'll have 130,000 antennas in Western Australia and nearly 200 dishes in South Africa, so we don't want to assemble and integrate everything and then discover something crucial is missing, or doesn't work as we expected it to,\" said Richard Lord, AIV Consortium Lead at SARAO. \"We've learned lessons from other telescopes about how challenging and risky it can be to the project if issues are identified too late, and how this can snowball into delays in deployment and increase in cost. Planning AIV roll-out activities now gives us the best possible preparation for procurement and construction.\" SARAO worked with Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON), all of which brought recent experience of carrying out AIV on radio telescopes, including SKA precursor and pathfinder instruments. \"The process of planning how to verify a radio telescope is not just about writing test procedures. It is a journey of discovery, one that explores the most efficient way to roll out a complex system, so that risks are mitigated as early as possible,\" added Richard. \"It is a journey that touches all aspects of the design. And most of all, it is a journey of communication, of creating a common goal and a common vision, so that everybody involved feels invested in the process, and can be equally proud when things come together.\" The work completed by the AIV Consortium will now form an essential part of the overall System Critical Design Review (CDR) later this year, which will ensure that all the different design elements of the SKA are in line with each other. \"This small consortium has moved mountains in terms of the amount of preparation done for both SKA telescopes - I want to sincerely thank them for their efforts,\" Peter Hekman concludes. \"After System CDR their work will really begin to pay dividends, as we put these plans into action with the construction of the SKA.\"", "url": "https://www.skao.int/en/news/249/south-african-led-assembly-integration-and-verification-aiv-consortium-completes-planning"}, {"title": "New Zealand pulls out of the Square Kilometre Array after benefits questioned", "date": "2019-07-04", "content": "The New Zealand government has announced that it will pull out of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), an ambitious international project to build a vast radio telescope spread out over two continents. The decision comes in the wake of numerous delays and rising costs, as well as heated discussions within New Zealand about the wisdom of spending billions on a project that, it fears, would benefit few astronomers. As its name suggests, the SKA is a facility intended to have a total collecting area of 1 km2. That will be achieved by spreading out thousands of individual dishes in southern Africa as well as around a million wire antennas in Australia. SKA is designed to provide astronomers with unprecedented views of the first stars in the universe and observations of gravitational waves via the radio emissions from pulsars, among other things. However, it is not clear when the complete observatory - with a likely price tag of several billion Euros - will see the light of day. As such, scientists are for now concentrating on building a much smaller preliminary facility known as SKA1. But even that is proving troublesome. The project's organisers are struggling to contain SKA1's costs below a ceiling imposed by member countries - currently \u20ac691m - while the start of scientific observations has been pushed back repeatedly - from an initial date of 2017 to now around 2027. New Zealand is currently one of 10 full member countries that currently make up the SKA Organisation, which coordinates the telescope's design and is based at Jodrell Bank in the UK. However, the country has now decided not to take part in building the project, which is due to begin in 2020. The plan was that New Zealand would have been an associate member of the SKA Observatory - an intergovernmental body also housed at Jodrell Bank that will oversee construction of the facility. The group was formed in March when Australia, China, Italy, the Netherlands, South Africa and the UK signed a treaty in Rome. Of the other three existing members, India and Sweden are preparing to sign up while Canada may instead become an associate member. One non-member nation - Portugal - also signed the treaty too. A political effort: New Zealand's decision to quit SKA was announced by its Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on 2 July after concluding that the benefits of continued membership \"are not sufficient to account for its cost\". Government official Simon Rae says the ministry estimated that ten years of associate membership would have cost up to NZ$40m when factoring in the NZ$20m-30m that it would have been needed to expand the country's radio astronomy community. Joining the construction phase, he explains, \"would only make sense if New Zealand could sufficiently utilise a share in the completed radio telescope\". One prominent critic of the SKA, Richard Easther, a cosmologist and head of physics at the University of Auckland, maintains that New Zealand's involvement in the project was not driven by science.

Nine of the consortia focused on the SKA's core elements, while three others were tasked with developing advanced instrumentation. In late 2018 and 2019 consortia started going through their Critical Design Reviews (CDRs), during which the proposed design for each of these elements had to meet the project's tough engineering requirements to be approved. The system review was the last major hurdle to be overcome before a construction proposal can be developed. \"They have done a tremendous job of actually getting the consortia to the point where they are able to move forward with the actual construction,\" said Dr. Alison Peck, member of the Review Panel from Gemini Observatory. As part of the design work, international teams have been engaged in building and testing prototypes on the SKA sites in South Africa and Australia, in order to make sure the design can cope with the harsh environment and meet the stringent radio frequency interference requirements on site. That work is ongoing as teams refine the design of the antennas based on lessons learned in the field.

Certainly looking from the outside it is very, very impressive.\" In November 2013, 12 international engineering consortia were created and tasked with designing the SKA. Nine of the consortia focused on the SKA's core elements, while three others were tasked with developing advanced instrumentation. In late 2018 and 2019 consortia started going through their Critical Design Reviews (CDRs), during which the proposed design for each of these elements had to meet the project's tough engineering requirements to be approved. The system review was the last major hurdle to be overcome before a construction proposal can be developed. \"They have done a tremendous job of actually getting the consortia to the point where they are able to move forward with the actual construction,\" said Dr. Alison Peck, member of the Review Panel from Gemini Observatory. As part of the design work, international teams have been engaged in building and testing prototypes on the SKA sites in South Africa and Australia, in order to make sure the design can cope with the harsh environment and meet the stringent radio frequency interference requirements on site. That work is ongoing as teams refine the design of the antennas based on lessons learned in the field. 'The team has really been outstanding and I speak not only of the team here at the HQ but also the broader team from our member institutions,\" said Dr. Joe McMullin, Programme Director and Deputy Director-General of the SKA. \"Having this milestone is really the foundation for everything in 2020. This is the year where we have to pull together the construction proposal itself.\" Teams will now engage in final preparations ahead of construction, addressing recommendations from the panel. as the new intergovernmental organisation that will oversee the procurement, construction and operation of the SKA starts operating. \"We've gotten our wish. We get to continue to move forward on the project and it is fantastically exciting to see this observatory beginning to come together,\" concluded Dr. McMullin.", "url": "https://www.skao.int/en/news/233/ska-passes-overall-design-review"}, {"title": "All systems go: SKA passes overall design review", "date": "2019-12-19", "content": "For some, December signals the wind-down towards the end of the year, but for SKA engineering teams, the last month of 2019 was the opposite as they geared up for a milestone six years in the making.

The two documents and their executive summary, which total some 500 pages, bring together the major outputs from several hundreds of documents that have been produced during the years of detailed planning for the SKA. The Construction Proposal for the SKA telescopes includes a summary of the scientific motivation, the so-called \"baseline design\" the Observatory will be building, as well as presenting details on the project engineering, computing, and the many broader impacts the project is expected to have on society over the years. The Observatory Establishment and Delivery Plan is a 10-year look ahead covering Observatory operations, business support functions, staffing across the SKAO facilities -in the UK, Australia and South Africa-, as well as a Development Programme to support the scientific development of SKAO. The Observatory will be one of the mega-science facilities of the 21st Century and will provide capabilities across the radio spectrum that will allow scientists to transform our understanding of the Universe. These documents are the culmination of many years of work by scientists and engineers from around the globe and we thank all those who contributed so much to the design of the SKA. SKAO is funded by the taxpayers of our Member nations and we publish these key documents so the public can see how their taxes are being spent and also have insight into the benefits that do and will flow from the technology developments required to deliver a state-of-the-art scientific facility.

Together they will form a total collecting area of one kilometer spanning two continents, which will allows the detection of very faint radio signals. \"I am ecstatic-this moment has been 30 years in the making,\" said Professor Philip Diamond, Director-General of SKAO, during an announcement at its global HQ in the U.K. this week. \"Humankind is taking another giant leap by committing to build what will be the largest science facility of its kind on the planet.\" SKAO is designed to unlock some of the secrets of the cosmos using radio astronomy-the study of the night sky in radio frequencies. Radio telescopes detect and amplify radio waves from space-electromagnetic radiation emitted by stars, galaxies and other cosmic objects. The SKAO is all about interferometry-many small antennas connected by optical fiber to create a virtual telescope called an array. It will boast far greater sensitivity and finer resolution than from one giant radio dish. The names of the two sites-SKA-Mid (South Africa) and SKA-Low (Western Australia)-describe the radio frequency range they each cover. At SKA-Mid 197 parabolic radio dishes will be built, each 50 feet/15 meters in diameter. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) has already built around a third of them. Meanwhile, SKA-Low will install a total of 131,072 low-frequency aperture array telescopes, each 6.5 feet/2 meters tall. They're being constructed with support from the Wajarri Yamaji, the traditional indigenous owners of the land on which the SKA-Low telescope will be built. \"The SKAO will be a good neighbour and will work with ... Indigenous communities, to ensure that they also benefit from the SKA project,\" said Diamond. \"We certainly intend to play our part in supporting local communities and boosting the local economy.\" It's estimated that they the two sites will together create 710 petabytes of science data when fully operational. That's expected to be 2029 after which astronomers can expect 50 years or more of transformational science, though it will be possible to conduct science within a few years.

The two telescopes, currently designated SKA-Low and SKA-Mid, names which describe the radio frequency range they each cover, will be the two largest and most complex networks of radio telescopes ever built. The decision to approve construction follows the creation of the SKAO as an intergovernmental organisation earlier this year, and the publication of two key documents, the Observatory's Construction Proposal and Observatory Establishment and Delivery Plan, last year. The documents are the culmination of over seven years of design and engineering work by more than 500 experts from 20 countries to develop and test the technologies needed to build and operate the state-of-the-art telescopes. Eleven international consortia representing more than 100 institutions including research labs, universities and companies from around the world, designed the antennas, networks, computing, software, and infrastructure needed for the telescopes to function. \"I am ecstatic. This moment has been 30 years in the making,\" said SKAO Director-General Prof. Philip Diamond. \"Today, humankind is taking another giant leap by committing to build what will be the largest science facility of its kind on the planet; not just one but the two largest and most complex radio telescope networks, designed to unlock some of the most fascinating secrets of our Universe.\" \"I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to making this possible over the past decades, from the early inception of the project until now, and in particular all the teams who have worked so hard over recent years and powered on through a pandemic in very difficult circumstances to meet deadlines and make this milestone possible. I would also like to thank our Member States for their vision and the trust they're placing in us by investing in a large-scale, long-term research infrastructure at a time when public finances are under intense pressure.\" \"I would like to add my thanks to the members of the SKAO Council and the governments they represent,\" said Dr Catherine Cesarsky, Chairperson of the SKAO Council. \"Giving the green light to start the construction of the SKA telescopes shows their confidence in the professional work that's been done by the SKAO to get here, with a sound plan that is ready for implementation, and in the bright future of this ground-breaking research facility.\" In addition to delivering exciting and revolutionary science, the construction of the SKA telescopes will produce tangible societal and economic benefits for countries involved in the project through direct and indirect economic returns from innovation and technological spin-offs, new high-tech jobs and boosted industrial capacity, among others. The well-documented impact prospect of the SKA Project (detailed in the Construction Proposal), outlining the multiple benefits already flowing to Member States and their communities thanks to their involvement in SKA-related activities over the last few years, was a key part of the case for the project. The SKA Project has seen impressive progress in recent months, with the successful completion of the ratification process of the SKAO treaty by all seven initial signatories, Australia, China, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa and the United Kingdom; excellent progress from France and Spain towards membership of the Observatory; and the signature of a cooperation agreement with Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne on behalf of Switzerland, with the Swiss government announcing its intention to eventually join the SKAO, pending approval from Parliament on the funding required for the participation of Switzerland until 2030. Other countries, including those that also took part in the design phase of the SKA telescopes (Canada, Germany, India, and Sweden), and other more recent joiners such as Japan and South Korea, complete the select list of Observers in the Council. \"Today's commitment by Member States is a strong signal for others to get aboard and reap the benefits of participation in this one-of-a-kind research facility,\" added Dr Cesarsky.", "url": "https://www.skao.int/en/news/174/green-light-given-construction-worlds-largest-radio-telescope-arrays"}, {"title": "Say Hello To The $2.2 Billion 'SKA' As Humanity's Biggest-Ever Telescope Gets The Green Light", "date": "2021-07-02", "content": "After a 30 year wait and seven years of design and engineering work, construction has finally started in South Africa and Western Australia on what will together be humanity's biggest-ever telescope.

This brings the total number of contracts signed so far to 27. Worth approximately \u20ac90 million in total, the contracts have been awarded to all seven current SKAO members, namely Australia, China, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.

So, what's been happening since construction was approved? And how does it all work? Let's take a deep dive. Over 60 top-level contracts: First off, teams are building on years and years of pre-construction design activity by partners all around the world that culminated in the production of the SKA Phase 1 Construction Proposal earlier this year.

Building on those years of preparatory work and substantial financial investment in the design of the SKA, countries expressed interest in supplying specific elements in which they had expertise such as the antennas, the supercomputers, the networks, software, etc. This resulted in a model where most contracts would be allocated to specific member countries, while unallocated contracts would be offered to all members. The result: over 60 \"Tier 1\" contracts placed by the SKAO. The vast majority are cash where the SKAO is the client, while a few are in-kind, or paid for directly by countries. Below them sit \"Tier 2\" contracts, placed between Tier 1 contractors and sub-contractors to deliver specific elements of the contract. \"There's been a huge amount of work by teams within the Observatory and across the partnership over time which has accelerated in the recent past to ensure industry-readiness as soon as we'd hit the go button,\" explains the SKAO's Head of Procurement Services, Ian Hastings (read our piece on procurement preparations ramping up in December 2020 here). The \"go button\" Ian talks about was the approval of construction by the SKAO Council at the end of June 2021. This thrusted the SKA's procurement process into its second stage: purchasing.

The Observatory was keen to get this right in order to make sure the construction of the SKA telescopes also benefits local communities and local industry around the sites, in line with its vision.

So said Dr Blade Nzimande, higher education, science and innovation minister, in a State of the Nation Address debate statement yesterday. South Africa and Australia are the joint hosts of the SKA telescope project, an international effort to build the world's largest radio telescope, with eventually over a square kilometre (one million square metres) of collecting area. According to Nzimande, close to \u20ac700 million (R12 billion) worth of contracts for the construction of the SKA will be awarded to companies and providers in the SKA member countries. The SKA was estimated to cost \u20ac1.8 billion (R30.7 billion) in 2014, including \u20ac650 million (R11 billion) for phase one, which represented about 10% of the planned capability of the entire telescope array. However, there have been numerous delays and rising costs over the nearly 30-year history of the intergovernmental project. \"South Africa stands to benefit greatly as a host country to the SKA,\" said the minister. Insane radio sensitivity: When complete, the SKA will operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size will make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument. Furthermore, processing the vast quantities of data produced by the SKA will require very high-performance central supercomputers capable of in excess of 100 petaflops (one hundred thousand million floating point operations per second) of raw processing power. With receiving stations extending out to a distance of at least 3 000km from a concentrated central core, the SKA will exploit radio astronomy's ability to provide the highest resolution images in all astronomy. The giant radio telescope is expected to be completed in 2028. Revealing some of the ministry's other important achievements in the science and innovation space, Nzimande pointed to the completion and commissioning of the 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope. \"The telescope provides scientific capabilities that do not exist anywhere else in the world,\" said the minister. MeerKAT, originally the Karoo Array Telescope, is a radio telescope inaugurated in 2018, consisting of 64 antennas spread over a diameter of 8km in the Northern Cape. According to the South African Radio Astronomy Organisation, MeerKAT is currently the most sensitive telescope of its kind in the world and is a precursor to the SKA. Already, the MeerKAT radio telescope has made some ground-breaking discoveries. In December last year, an international team of astronomers utilised the radio telescope to discover a mysterious chain of hydrogen gas clouds the size of a massive galaxy. The previous month, the radio telescope revealed new, previously unseen cosmic puzzles. In June, the telescope produced a striking image showing a combination of cosmic features never before seen, revealing unexpected details of the inner workings of enormous radio galaxies. In April 2020, an international team of astronomers uncovered unusual features in the radio galaxy ESO 137-006 using MeerKAT data.", "url": "https://www.itweb.co.za/content/mQwkoq6PrNK73r9A"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Crucial agreements pave way for Square Kilometre Array", "date": "2021-10-18", "content": " The SKA Observatory has signed agreements with Australia and South Africa, paving the way for the countries to host the Square Kilometre Array telescopes and associated infrastructure. Known as host country agreements, these were signed by SKAO director- general professor Philip Diamond; David Fredericks, Australia's secretary of the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources; and SA's Dr Phil Mjwara, DG at the Department of Science and Innovation. Comprising of two documents, the signed agreements formalise the arrangements for the construction and operation of the SKA telescopes in the two host countries, says the SKAO in a statement. \"I am very pleased that we have finalised these agreements, which enable us to progress smoothly into the deployment of SKAO resources into Australia and South Africa, and the construction phase of the SKA telescopes,\" says Diamond. \"I wish to thank our colleagues in the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources in Australia, and the Department of Science and Innovation in South Africa, for their efforts throughout this process.\" \"Negotiating these agreements has been a complex process involving many people over a number of years, but to now have them signed is a really important step in the delivery of the project, and the collaborative attitude of all involved sets us up well for this next, critical stage,\" adds Dr Lewis Ball, SKAO director of operations, who led the last two years of negotiations. Officially launched earlier this year, the SKAO is the intergovernmental organisation responsible for constructing and operating the SKA radio telescope. In June, the organisation and its member states approved a R34 billion budget for construction of the SKA project in South Africa and Australia. The SKA project is an intergovernmental radio telescope project being planned to be built in the two countries. Conceived in the 1990s, and further developed and designed by the late-2010s, when completed, it will have a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre. It will operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size will make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument. Furthermore, processing the vast quantities of data produced by the SKA will require very high-performance central supercomputers capable of in excess of 100 petaflops (one hundred thousand million million floating point operations per second) of raw processing power. The SKAO reveals the agreement documents set out the rights and responsibilities of each party regarding the sites, assets and infrastructure required to build and operate the SKA telescopes. Among other elements is the respective governments' obligation to provide radio frequency interference protection for the SKA telescope sites, and the SKAO's obligation to ensure its operations meet or exceed local and national health, safety and environmental laws. Additionally, they cover the SKAO's use of infrastructure, such as existing airstrips and fibre links.

The Observatory was keen to get this right in order to make sure the construction of the SKA telescopes also benefits local communities and local industry around the sites, in line with its vision. Another way the Observatory ensures benefits trickle down to the local economy is with assessment criteria that reward bids outlining plans to subcontract to local companies, especially ones benefiting previously disadvantaged groups.", "url": "https://www.skao.int/index.php/en/news/135/ska-construction-steams-ahead-over-two-dozen-contracts-committed"}, {"title": "Square Kilometre Array the World's Largest Telescope project update ", "date": "2022-01-12", "content": "The world's biggest telescope, the Square Kilometre Array, is rapidly approaching completion.

So said Dr Blade Nzimande, higher education, science and innovation minister, in a State of the Nation Address debate statement yesterday. South Africa and Australia are the joint hosts of the SKA telescope project, an international effort to build the world's largest radio telescope, with eventually over a square kilometre (one million square metres) of collecting area. According to Nzimande, close to \u20ac700 million (R12 billion) worth of contracts for the construction of the SKA will be awarded to companies and providers in the SKA member countries. The SKA was estimated to cost \u20ac1.8 billion (R30.7 billion) in 2014, including \u20ac650 million (R11 billion) for phase one, which represented about 10% of the planned capability of the entire telescope array. However, there have been numerous delays and rising costs over the nearly 30-year history of the intergovernmental project. \"South Africa stands to benefit greatly as a host country to the SKA,\" said the minister. Insane radio sensitivity: When complete, the SKA will operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size will make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument. Furthermore, processing the vast quantities of data produced by the SKA will require very high-performance central supercomputers capable of in excess of 100 petaflops (one hundred thousand million floating point operations per second) of raw processing power. With receiving stations extending out to a distance of at least 3 000km from a concentrated central core, the SKA will exploit radio astronomy's ability to provide the highest resolution images in all astronomy. The giant radio telescope is expected to be completed in 2028. Revealing some of the ministry's other important achievements in the science and innovation space, Nzimande pointed to the completion and commissioning of the 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope. \"The telescope provides scientific capabilities that do not exist anywhere else in the world,\" said the minister. MeerKAT, originally the Karoo Array Telescope, is a radio telescope inaugurated in 2018, consisting of 64 antennas spread over a diameter of 8km in the Northern Cape. According to the South African Radio Astronomy Organisation, MeerKAT is currently the most sensitive telescope of its kind in the world and is a precursor to the SKA. Already, the MeerKAT radio telescope has made some ground-breaking discoveries. In December last year, an international team of astronomers utilised the radio telescope to discover a mysterious chain of hydrogen gas clouds the size of a massive galaxy. The previous month, the radio telescope revealed new, previously unseen cosmic puzzles. In June, the telescope produced a striking image showing a combination of cosmic features never before seen, revealing unexpected details of the inner workings of enormous radio galaxies. In April 2020, an international team of astronomers uncovered unusual features in the radio galaxy ESO 137-006 using MeerKAT data.", "url": "https://www.itweb.co.za/content/mQwkoq6PrNK73r9A"}, {"title": "'Next phase of construction of SKA satellite project to begin soon'", "date": "2022-03-14", "content": "The Department of Science and Innovation says the next phase of construction of South Africa's Square Kilometre Array satellite project in the Northern Cape will begin soon.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be the largest radio telescope in the world when completed in 2028. Split across South Africa and Australia, with a headquarters in the UK, the facility will address the biggest questions in astrophysics. It will perform the most precise tests of Einstein's theories, and even search for extra-terrestrials. Delegations from the eight countries leading the project are attending ceremonies in the remote Murchison shire in Western Australia and in the Karoo of South Africa's Northern Cape. When the festivities are over, the bulldozers will move in. \"This is the moment it becomes real,\" said Prof Phil Diamond, director general of the Square Kilometre Array Organisation. \"It's been a 30-year journey. The first 10 years were about developing the concepts and ideas. The second 10 was spent doing the technology development. And then the last decade was about detailed design, securing the sites, getting governments to agree to set up a treaty organisation (SKAO) and provide the funds to start,\" he told BBC News. The initial architecture of the telescope will incorporate just under 200 parabolic antennas, or \"dishes\", as well as 131,000 dipole antennas, which look a little like Christmas trees. The aim is to construct an effective collecting area measuring hundreds of thousands of square metres. This will give the SKA unparalleled sensitivity and resolution as it probes targets on the sky. The system will operate across a frequency range from roughly 50 megahertz to, ultimately, 25 gigahertz. In wavelength terms, this is in the centimetres to metres range. This should enable the telescope to detect very faint radio signals coming from cosmic sources billions of light-years from Earth, including those signals emitted in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang. One of the SKA's great quests will be to trace the full history of hydrogen, the most abundant element in the Universe. The telescope should be able to detect hydrogen's presence even before great clouds of it collapsed to form the first stars.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63836496"}, {"title": "Square Kilometre Array Telescope construction begins in West Australian outback", "date": "2022-12-05", "content": "Unparalleled access to the stars once only dreamed of by astronomers is set to become a reality, as construction of the Square Kilometre Array Telescope (SKA) officially begins. Situated deep in the outback of Western Australia, more than 100,000 antennas will be built across 74 kilometres in the Murchison region on Wajarri country as part of the $3 billion project, involving 16 countries. The structures are set to provide answers to some of humanity's oldest and most enduring questions about our universe. SKA low site construction director Antony Schinckel said the telescope was the first of its kind. \"There's really nothing else like it in the world,\" Dr Schinckel said. \"There are other radio telescopes, other optical telescopes [but] there's nothing even comparable to this, the scale of this telescope in Australia.\" Dr Schinckel said the idea of building a massive telescope to further our understanding of the universe came about in the early 90s, and by 2003 the SKA project had begun. \"It became apparent that to look back into the earliest epoch of the universe's evolution, just after the Big Bang, we simply needed a really big telescope,\" he said. Data to flow in four to five years: SKA low telescope director Sarah Pearce said planning the world's biggest telescope had been three decades in the making. \"So, we expect to have bulldozers and the like on site early next year, it will take us until about 2028 to build the whole telescope,\" Dr Pearce said. She said scientists would start dissecting data at the halfway point of the build. \"We expect the first science results might come as soon as four or five years from now,\" she said. Dr Pearce said the SKA site would work in parallel with a project in South Africa that has 197 dishes. Combined, the two sites will create one of the biggest science facilities on Earth. \"The headquarters with a telescope is in the UK, we have another telescope being built in South Africa, which will be complementary,\" she said. Sixteen countries from around the world have invested their skills, money and resources into the project. \"Each of the countries is bringing their area of expertise, \" Dr Pearce said. \"The antennas are made in Italy, India will lead some of the software work, China is doing some of the signal and timing workflow telescope. \"This is really a world-class system, and the first time that Australia has really hosted one of these mega-science projects for the international community.\" CSIRO aboriginal liaison officer Leonie Boddington said the site had been given the traditional name, Inyarrimanha Ilgari Bundara, which meant sharing sky and stars in Wajarri language. \"I'm really excited about it at the moment because you've got SKA coming here and adopted a Wajarri name, as well, that's shown a bit of respect to us,\" she said. \"It's putting the Wajarri people on the map as well.

The SKAO's Director-General, Prof. Philip Diamond, travelled to Western Australia to represent the Observatory at the site of the future SKA-Low telescope. Council Chair Dr Catherine Cesarsky attended the event in South Africa's Northern Cape province where the SKA-Mid telescope will be located. In her address, Dr Cesarsky said: \"The SKA project has been many years in the making. Today, we gather here to mark another important chapter in this 30-year journey that we've been on together. A journey to deliver the world's largest scientific instrument. After 18 months of intense activities around the world, we are starting construction of the SKA telescopes.\" Over the past 18 months, over 40 contracts worth more than \u20ac150 million have been entered into by the observatory. On Monday, major new construction contracts worth over \u20ac300 million were announced at the ceremonies. Minister Ed Husic from Australia and South Africa's Dr Blade Nzimande announced more than \u20ac200 million for Australian and South African companies to deliver some of the extensive infrastructure required for the telescopes. The SKAO also announced the major contracts - worth \u20ac100 million - to manufacture the antennas for both telescopes, bringing the total amount of construction funds allocated so far by the observatory to close to \u20ac500 million. In their announcements, the science ministers elaborated on the contractual conditions that the SKAO placed on infrastructure providers to include local communities. In South Africa, the lead infrastructure contractor is required to spend a proportionate amount locally by providing a range of sub-contract opportunities to local SMMEs, on employing, training and transferring skills locally and on other community development initiatives. In Australia, the aim is to create nearly 100 new roles for the Wajarri Yamaji and locals in the Mid West region of Western Australia. The Indigenous Land Use Agreement recently signed between the Wajarri Yamaji and the Australian federal and Western Australian governments as well as CSIRO, expanded Inyarrimanha Ilgari Bundara, the CSIRO Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory to enable construction of the SKA telescope there. The agreement ensures that Wajarri Yamaji cultural heritage will stay protected and that they will receive sustainable and intergenerational benefits in areas such as enterprise and training and education. About 400 km of ground was surveyed to map areas of cultural significance, and the layout of the SKA telescope array was amended to avoid significant Wajarri heritage sites. In recognition of the agreement, the Wajarri gifted the site the traditional name - Inyarrimanha Ilgari Bundara, meaning \"sharing the sky and stars\". \"We want to be good neighbours to all of the local stakeholders where our infrastructure is located,\" said Prof. Diamond. \"It's important that we play our part in supporting the local economy as well as the national one, and we're doing our small part to ensure this is the case. For example, we've instructed infrastructure contractors to ensure local businesses are engaged and benefit from those contracts as well.\"", "url": "https://www.skao.int/en/news/441/ska-observatory-celebrates-start-telescope-construction-australia-and-south-africa"}, {"title": "Construction begins on the \u20ac1.3bn Square Kilometre Array", "date": "2022-12-17", "content": "On-site construction for the \u20ac1.3bn Square Kilometre Array (SKA) began in Australia and South Africa on 5 December for what will be the world's largest radio-astronomy infrastructure when complete in 2028.

First conceptualized 30 years ago, the SKA project underwent several years of design and engineering work. The SKAO - an intergovernmental organization with 16 partner countries including eight members - will manage the construction and operation of the telescope from its headquarters at Jodrell Bank in the UK. South Africa will have 133 SKA dishes during this phase, which will be added to the existing 64 that belong to the SKA-precursor telescope - MeerKAT - to form a mid-frequency instrument. Australia will host a low-frequency array of 131,072 antennas, enlarging the area covered by radio frequencies from the two telescopes. The first two antenna stations are due to be complete by May 2023, while the first dish is set to be installed in April 2024, followed by three to four dishes each month. On 5 December an event was held at the site of the SKA-Low telescope in Western Australia, attended by Philip Diamond, SKAO director-general.
