The goal of this space mission, currently planned for launch in 2011, is to make the largest, most precise map of our own Galaxy to date. The contract, worth 317 million Euros, has been jointly signed by ESA's Director of Science, Professor David Southwood, and Antoine Bouvier, Chief Executive Officer for EADS Astrium. The Toulouse branch will lead the Gaia development. \"GAIA is our next grand challenge - to understand our galactic home, the Milky Way,\" says David Southwood. \"It is a great privilege to meet the team in EADS Astrium and to wish them well in working with us in this great project.\" Gaia will be the most accurate optical astronomy satellite ever built so far. It will continuously scan the sky for at least five years from a point in space known as the second Lagrangian point (or L2), located at about 1.6 million kilometres away from the Earth, in the direction opposite to the Sun. This position in space offers a very stable thermal environment, very high observing efficiency (since the Sun, Earth and Moon are behind the instrument field of view) and a low radiation environment. Gaia's goal is to perform the largest census of our Galaxy and build a highly accurate 3D map. The satellite will determine the position, colour and true motion of one thousand million stars. Gaia will also identify as many as 10 000 planets around other stars, and discover several tens of thousands of new bodies - comets and asteroids - in our own Solar System. The accuracy of Gaia measurements will be extremely high - if Gaia were on the Moon, it could measure the thumbnail of a person on Earth! The spacecraft will use the global astronomy concept successfully demonstrated on its predecessor - ESA's mission Hipparcos, also built by EADS Astrium - which successfully mapped over 100,000 stars in the late 1980s. Gaia will be equipped with a latest-generation scientific payload, integrating the most sensitive telescope ever made. Its design is based on silicon carbide (SiC) technology, also used on Herschel, ESA's next infrared mission. The focal plane is of impressive dimensions - about half a square metre - and features one thousand million pixels. Gaia will also be equipped with two key components. The first one is a deployable sun-shield, covering an area of one hundred square metres, to minimise the temperature fluctuations on the highly sensitive optics. The second is a new micro-propulsion system, to be used to smoothly control the spacecraft in order not to disturb the optics during the sky scanning.", "url": "https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Business_with_ESA/ESA_selects_prime_contractor_for_Gaia_astrometry_mission"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Gaia celestial mapper heads out of UK", "date": "2010-07-20", "content": "It should be one of the great space ventures of the decade.

The second primary mirror is near completion and scheduled to arrive at the Toulouse test and integration centre of prime contractor EADS Astrium during October. Gaia will carry two identical telescopes, each fitted with four mirrors (M1 to 4). A further two mirrors (M5 and 6) will send the light from these dual instruments into the same focal plane. To date, six of the 10 rectangular mirrors have been delivered. They are: the M3A tertiary mirror, whose dimensions are 0.65 x 0.275 m; both of the M4 combiner mirrors (dimensions 0.19 x 0.07 m), and the M5 and M6 mirrors (dimensions 0.54 x 0.36 m), in addition to the M1A primary mirror (dimensions 1.49 x 0.54 m). All of the mirrors have been fabricated from blanks made of sintered silicon carbide (SiC), a relatively new material in mirror fabrication for space missions. The blanks were made by Boostec in France. Silicon carbide was selected because it allows each mirror to be extremely strong and rigid, but lightweight and with a high thermal conductivity - important not only for its on-orbit performance, but also for minimising deformations caused by Earth's gravity during ground testing. Each primary mirror is shaped by the French company Sagem (located close to Paris), using computer-guided milling and polishing machines, and weighs about 40 kg. To achieve sufficient smoothness, all of the mirror blanks were coated with a thin layer of silicon carbide by chemical vapour deposition before polishing started. This process was carried out by Schunk Kohlenstofftechnik in Heuchelheim, Germany. The polishing is a slow, painstaking process which requires each mirror to be polished to a precision of about 10 nanometres RMS. To appreciate this technical achievement one can consider that if the Gaia M1 mirror was scaled to the size of the Atlantic ocean, any bumps on the surface would be of the order of a few centimetres. The mirrors also have an unusual curved shape, which is calculated using a very precise mathematical formula so that there will be no distortion of the incoming light across the telescopes' field of view and at all wavelengths from blue to red. After polishing, the surface is coated with enhanced silver reflective coating. This coating involves the addition of a dielectric amplification layer, which protects the silver from tarnishing and enhances its reflectivity across the entire spectral range (320 - 1000 nanometres) to be studied by Gaia. \"The mirrors are being integrated on the structural payload module in order to complete the optical train and enable testing to begin,\" said Matthias Erdmann, ESA's Gaia payload system engineer. \"Their shape and size were determined by the room available within the payload fairing of the Soyuz-Fregat launcher.\" \"The M1 mirrors have a collecting area about 11 times bigger than the primary mirror of its predecessor, ESA's Hipparcos astrometry spacecraft, enabling them to collect many more photons,\" said Jos de Bruijne, Deputy Project Scientist for Gaia. \"The combination of size, smoothness and special shape is required to provide a wide angle of view - about 0.7 degrees - and a small wave front error that will give extremely sharp images of a billion stars in our Galaxy.\" Gaia will view two widely separated areas of the sky, using two identical telescopes. Over its five-year mission, it will scan the entire sky, observing each of its target stars about 70 times. By accurately monitoring the two-dimensional star positions on the sky, it will be possible to infer their lateral motions across the sky and to calculate their precise three-dimensional locations, even for objects as far away as the galactic centre.

The antenna provides the high gain and data rate needed to allow large volumes of data to be transmitted over the 1.5 million kilometres that will separate the spacecraft's operational orbit from Earth. The use of electronic beam steering allows the signal to be directed towards Earth as the spacecraft rotates; a conventional, mechanically pointed antenna would cause microvibrations, seriously impacting the performance of the telescope. HIGH DATA RATE: The Gaia mission will perform astrometric measurements on over one billion objects in the Milky Way and its Local Group. To do this, the spacecraft will spend five years in a Lissajous orbit around the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth system (L2), which is located 1.5 million km from Earth in the anti-Sun direction. Gaia will generate an enormous volume of data - about 200 TB (uncompressed) over its nominal five-year mission. Even with data compression, the restrictions imposed by the size of the on-board solid-state mass memory (constrained by cost, mass, power consumption and reliability considerations), the ~8 hour per day ground station downlink window and the desire not to discard data impose a requirement for an extremely high downlink rate of up to 8.7 Mbps, given the distance over which the data has to be communicated. BEAM STEERING: Gaia will perform its measurements by simultaneously observing two target fields. The spacecraft will rotate around its longitudinal axis at a rate of 60 arcsec/s, equivalent to a spin period of six hours, to scan its fields of view across the sky. The downlink antenna is mounted on the Sun-pointing face of the Service Module, which is perpendicular to the rotation axis. The antenna beam must be steered, to keep it pointed at Earth both as the spacecraft rotates and as it moves through its orbit around L2. Conventional dish antennas address requirements of this type by employing mechanical rotation or steering. However, the very stringent requirements regarding microvibration make the use of mechanisms infeasible for Gaia. The chosen alternative solution is to use a phased array antenna that accomplishes beam steering through electronic means. A phased array antenna is made up of a number of radiating elements and a system for shifting the phase of the signal that is fed to each element. By adjusting the phase of the signal radiated by each of the elements, interference is employed to steer the radiated beam in the desired direction. Constructive interference gives rise to a peak in the radiation pattern, while destructive interference helps to improve the sharpness of the beam. GAIA PHASED ARRAY ANTENNA: The Gaia Phased Array Antenna (PAA) forms part of the spacecraft Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C) subsystem and operates at X band. The TT&C subsystem acts as the interface between the spacecraft and its ground stations and, in addition to typical TT&C functions, it supports high data rate downlinking of science data. The PAA will also be used to support a ranging function for the spacecraft, requiring high phase stability from the hardware. All PAA hardware is mounted on an Antenna Support Panel that is, in turn, fixed to the Sun-pointing face of the Gaia spacecraft. The Radiating Cone is mounted on the exterior surface of the support panel; all other subsystems are mounted on the 'internal' face. The PAA hardware and the antenna panel are thermally isolated from the spacecraft by a thermal tent, with the Antenna Support Panel providing the radiating surfaces needed to reject the heat generated by the PAA. The Radiating Cone is a 14-sided truncated pyramid; its primary structure is machined from solid aluminium alloy. Each facet has two sub-arrays, each comprised of six radiating elements; each sub-array has a series of RF couplers that split the incoming signal to provide the amplitude weighting that determines the radiation pattern of the sub-array. The overall antenna radiation pattern is obtained by combining the radiation patterns from the 14 sub-arrays on the Earth-pointing side of the radiating cone. The 28 antenna sub-arrays are fed by seven 'Quadri-Modules', which provide low-level gain, phase and amplitude control, power amplification and routing of signals to the appropriate sub-arrays. The Quadri-Modules are, in turn, fed by a 2:7-way splitter that allows the spacecraft's nominal or cold-redundant transponder to feed the PAA. The PAA Electronic Power and Interface Controller (EPIC) contains a secondary voltage converter for power from the Gaia spacecraft primary power bus and a TT&C remote control terminal for the Gaia 1553B spacecraft data bus. EPIC provides all secondary power and control signals required by the seven Quadri-Modules within the PAA. EPIC also acquires operational telemetry from the Quadri-Modules and passes it to the spacecraft via the 1553 bus, along with its own health telemetry. The Gaia PAA has a gain of about 16.8 dB. The 28 Solid-State Power Amplifiers (SSPAs) deliver a total of nearly 59 W (~17.7 dBW) to achieve an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) of just over 34 dBW (~2.6 kW).", "url": "https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/50523-gaia-phased-array-antenna-delivered-and-integrated"}, {"title": "1 Giga-Pixel Gaia Sensor Assembled", "date": "2011-07-09", "content": "The largest digital camera ever built for a space mission has been painstakingly mosaicked together from 106 separate CCDs.

Seven years in development and 13 years after it was formally approved by European space scientists, Gaia will provide an order-of-magnitude improvement over the performance of Europe's Hipparcos satellite, which was launched in 1989 and produced a map of 100,000 stars. The Gaia industrial contracting team, led by Astrium Satellites, wrapped up final satellite tests June 26 and will now prepare it for shipment to Europe's Guiana Space Center on the northeast coast of South America. Giuseppe Sarri, Gaia project manager at the 20-nation European Space Agency (ESA), said Gaia will be shipped to the spaceport even if there are more tests to be done, in part to secure the launch date, tentatively set for Oct. 25. Europe's Soyuz manifest has been the subject of a competition among payloads this year as originally six missions were planning liftoffs when only four Soyuz rockets were available in 2013. While the Gaia satellite is of modest size, just 2,030 kilograms at launch, it is an example of Big Science enabled by Big Data. Mapping a billion stars, each from 70 separate observations made over Gaia's 4.5-year observing life from the L2 Lagrangian point around the sun 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, means 40 million observations per day. To handle the data flow estimated at 40 gigabytes per day, or more than 1 petabyte, or 1 million gigabytes, over the mission's life, a multination Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) has been created. Six data-processing centers have been established in Europe. It will need massive parallel computing power. Francois Mignard of DPAC said during a Gaia preshipment press briefing here at Astrium Satellites' facility that spending only one second to process the data on each star swept up in Gaia's view would take 30 years to process. Gaia's current budget is estimated at about 940 million euros, or $1.24 billion. ESA is paying 740 million euros to build and launch the satellite and operate it for five years in orbit. Another 200 million euros has been spent over six years by the DPAC consortium, Mignard said, with more to come as Gaia reaches orbit and begins sending down data. The mission originally was scheduled for launch in late 2011. But despite being nearly two years late, it is only over budget by about 16 percent, according to Sarri. Even that figure is exaggerated since nearly half of the budget overrun was caused by the increased cost of the Europeanized Soyuz medium-lift rocket. Sarri said ESA had penciled in a 40 million-euro cost for the Soyuz when Gaia was approved, using the price ESA paid for a Soyuz launch of the agency's Mars Express satellite in 2003. But that launch was from Soyuz's traditional launch site, the Russian-run Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Launching from the European spaceport is more expensive. Sarri said the agency's originally forecast cost of 40 million euros swelled to around 65 million euros by the time the contract was signed in late 2009. The remaining overruns were due to the payload module of Gaia. Sarri said ESA was able to limit the financial costs of the two-year delay by waiting until the last minute to ramp up ESA's own Gaia team. When it became clear that Gaia would miss its 2011 launch date by a wide margin, the agency maintained its limited-size Gaia team. That way, he said, ESA's program management charges did not swell over the two-year period. The Gaia payload module required three years of work by Astrium engineers to assemble, integrate and test to assure that the optical alignment to within a few microns of precision was up to specifications, said Vincent Poinsignon, Astrium's Gaia project manager. The satellite has a giga-pixel focal plane assembly and 106 CCD chips arranged in a half-meter-square mosaic. Gaia's precision is made possible not only by its orbit - the stability of the L2 Lagrangian point is well-known - but also by a micropropulsion cold-gas system that took nearly eight years to develop. The thrusters expel 1.5 micrograms of nitrogen per second to provide satellite attitude control. If it works as planned, Gaia's focus will be sharp enough to be able to view a human hair at a distance of 1,000 kilometers.

Gaia has been travelling towards L2 since 19 December, when, just before dawn local time, it was spectacularly launched from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. A day later, Gaia performed an important thruster burn to set course to its destination. Last night, a critical manoeuvre boosted Gaia into its 263 000 x 707 000 x 370 000 km, 180 day-long orbit around L2. A small course correction will be made next week to complete the manoeuvre. \"Entering orbit around L2 is a rather complex endeavour, achieved by firing Gaia's thrusters in such a way as to push the spacecraft in the desired direction whilst keeping the Sun away from the delicate science instruments,\" describes David Milligan, Gaia spacecraft operations manager. \"After a beautiful launch from Kourou last month, we are very happy to now have reached our destination, and we are looking forward to starting our science operations in the coming months,\" says Giuseppe Sarri, ESA's Gaia project manager. Once the spacecraft instruments have been fully tested and calibrated - an activity that started en route to L2 and will continue for another four months - Gaia will be ready to enter a five-year operational phase. Gaia will make very accurate observations of one billion stars, charting their precise positions and motions, as well as their temperatures, luminosities and compositions. This enormous census will result in the most accurate 3D map yet of the Milky Way and allow astronomers to determine the origin and the evolution of our galaxy. To achieve its goal, Gaia will spin slowly, sweeping its two telescopes across the entire sky and focusing their light simultaneously onto a single digital camera - the largest ever flown in space with nearly a billion pixels. Gaia will observe each star an average of 70 times over the five-year mission, after which the data archive will exceed one million Gigabytes, equivalent to about 200 000 DVDs' worth of data. The task of processing and analysing this colossal treasure trove of data will fall to the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium, comprising more than 400 individuals at scientific institutes across Europe. \"Our Gaia discovery machine will keep us busy throughout the mission, with the final results coming only after the five years of data have been analysed.

The precision of the measurements taken by Gaia's optical instruments will be extremely high. For instance, Gaia would be capable of picking out a strand of hair from a distance of 700 kilometres, the equivalent of the altitude of Earth observation satellites, thanks to its huge focal plane made up of 106 CCD detectors gathering 1 billion pixels. For its attitude control, the spacecraft will use a cold gas propulsion system (nitrogen) with micro-thrusters, enabling it to remain perfectly stable and point with the required extreme accuracy. Gaia will be located at one of the five Lagrangian points in the Sun-Earth system, at the L2 point. The Lagrangian points in our solar system are points of gravitational balance where a body such as a spacecraft orbits around the Sun at the same rate as Earth, thereby remaining in a fixed position relative to the Earth-Sun line.

Launched in December, the satellite has now reached its destination 1.5 million km from Earth. Engineers are currently commissioning Gaia's two telescopes and its three instruments, getting them ready to begin mapping the precise positions and motions of one-thousand-million stars. Its first test image shows a dense cluster of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Once Gaia starts making routine measurements, it will generate truly enormous amounts of data. To maximise the key science of the mission, only small 'cut-outs' centred on each of the stars it detects will be sent back to Earth for analysis. This test picture, taken as part of commissioning the mission to 'fine tune' the behaviour of the instruments, is one of the first proper 'images' to be seen from Gaia, but ironically, it will also be one of the last. Professor Gerry Gilmore, from the University of Cambridge and UK Principal Investigator for Gaia, said: 'Seeing the first magnificent images from Gaia's UK-built billion pixel camera first of all generates a huge vote of thanks to all those scientists and engineers who have worked so hard to make this happen. 'Second, it provides just a tiny taste of the excellence and challenges ahead, to turn Gaia data into human understanding of the Milky Way's origins. 'One substantial step for astronomy, one huge leap still to come.' Gaia's goal is to create the most accurate map yet of the Milky Way. It will make precise measurements of the positions and motions of about 1% of the total population of roughly 100 billion stars in our home Galaxy to help answer questions about its origin and evolution. UK participation in the mission is funded by the UK Space Agency and scientists and engineers from around the UK have played key roles in the design and build of Gaia. Dr Chris Castelli, Acting Director of Technology, Science and Exploration at the UK Space Agency, said: 'Gaia is an important space mission for the UK; we've won around \u20ac80 million of contracts from the European Space Agency to build the spacecraft and are providing a state of the art data centre that will turn the mission's raw data into the largest stellar catalogue ever made.' Repeatedly scanning the sky, Gaia will observe each of its billion stars an average of 70 times each over five years. In addition to positions and motions, Gaia will also measure key physical properties of each star, including its brightness, temperature and chemical composition. To achieve its goal, Gaia will spin slowly, sweeping its two telescopes across the entire sky and focusing the light from their separate fields simultaneously onto a single digital camera - the largest ever flown in space, with nearly a billion pixels. But first, the telescopes must be aligned and focused, along with precise calibration of the instruments, a painstaking procedure that will take several months before Gaia is ready to enter its five-year operational phase. While all one billion of Gaia's target stars will have been observed during the first six months of operations, repeated observations over five years will be needed to measure their tiny movements to allow astronomers to determine their distances and motions through space. As a result, Gaia's final catalogue will not be released until three years after the end of the nominal five-year mission. Intermediate data releases will be made, however, and if rapidly changing objects such as supernovae are detected, alerts will be released within hours of data processing, its operators say. Eventually, the Gaia data archive will exceed a million Gigabytes, equivalent to about 200 000 DVDs of data.", "url": "https://www.eutimes.net/2014/02/billion-pixel-gaia-telescope-takes-its-first-picture/"}, {"title": "Europe's Billion-Star Mapping Spacecraft Snaps 1st Photo", "date": "2014-02-12", "content": "A new European spacecraft tasked with mapping a billion stars in the night sky has beamed its first picture back to Earth. The European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft aimed its gaze a dense young cluster of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud for its first test image, which ESA officials unveiled Feb. 6. As amazing as the picture is, it only covers an area less than 1 percent of Gaia's full field of view, ESA officials added. Gaia launched into space on Dec. 19 and it will spend five years studying the precise positions, motions and properties of 1 billion stars in the Milky Way, with the goal of creating the most accurate 3D map to date of our home galaxy. ESA officials have said the $1 billion (740 million euros) mission will help scientists better understand the history and formation of the universe. To carry out this daunting task, Gaia's surveying instruments must be precisely calibrated. And to help bring Gaia into its fully operational phase, the mission team members have been downloading test images from the camera, like this inaugural shot of the galaxy cluster NGC1818, which lies in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way some 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Gaia has two telescopes that can stare out at two different patches of the sky simultaneously. The light from both telescopes is fed to Gaia's camera, which is the highest-resolution image sensor ever flown in space with about 1 billion pixels. When Gaia is fully brought to life, it will measure an average of 2 million stars per hour, which translates to about 50 gigabytes of data each day. Gaia will eventually compile more than million gigabytes of data, or the equivalent of about 200,000 fully loaded DVDs, ESA officials said. Because Gaia has such a sweeping view of the sky, it will be able to capture all one billion of its targets during its first six months in operation. But the spacecraft will measure each of its stars an average of 70 times throughout the course of its five-year mission so that astronomers poring over the data can study the stars' distances and motions through space. Additionally, Gaia will measure physical characteristics of the stars, including their brightness, temperature and chemical makeup, according to ESA. A Russian Soyuz-Fregat rocket carried Gaia aloft from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana in South America. The spacecraft is parked in the sun-Earth Lagrange Point 2 (L2), a gravitationally stable point in space.", "url": "https://www.space.com/24616-gaia-billion-star-mapping-spacecraft-photo.html"}, {"title": "Largest ever space camera is ready to map a billion stars", "date": "2014-02-26", "content": "After its successful launch in December, European Space Agency's (ESA) Gaia has now taken up its position in space and is ready to survey the skies. With the help of two onboard telescopes focused onto the largest ever space camera, Gaia is estimated to catalogue nearly one billion stars in its 5-year mission. Like Hipparcos before it, ESA's Gaia will map stars in the Milky Way. It will do this by measuring the brightest billion objects and determine their three-dimensional distribution and velocities. It also has the ability to measure the temperature, mass, and chemical composition of these billion objects. Gaia will be able to discern objects up to 400,000 times dimmer than those visible to the naked eye. The positional accuracy of its measurements are akin to measuring the width of a human hair at a distance of 500 km. The process will involve scanning each part of the sky an average of 70 times over its five-year mission lifetime, which means scanning the entire sky twice every 63 days, once through each of the two telescopes, making it a powerful tool for spotting time-evolving phenomena such as binary systems, supernovae, and exoplanets. Compared to Hipparcos, Gaia will be able to measure 500 times the number of stars, extending to objects 1000 times dimmer than the dimmest that Hipparcos could catalogue. The technology that makes this possible is the largest camera ever launched into space - 940 million pixels. That is why a lot of effort before launch was on figuring out exactly how to get the huge amount of data Gaia will produce back down to Earth. When a picture is taken a number of charged-coupled devices (CCDs) - the stuff most digital camera sensors are made off - are dedicated to spotting objects before they fall onto the main focal plane. This allows the instrument to track the objects as they pass and only retain small regions around the object, reducing the file-size needed to be sent to Earth. In five years it will send only 100 TB of data (1 TB is 1000 GB). Once the data arrives to Earth, there is a system in place to analyse the data and distribute alerts to ground-based observatories if anything quickly evolving and potentially interesting is spotted, such as supernovae. The catalogue produced by Gaia is expected to contribute to many areas of astrophysics, multiply our database of exotic objects such as exoplanets, white and brown dwarfs, and supernovae many-fold, contribute to more precise measurements of General Relativity, help to constrain the measurements of the presence and location of dark matter, and give us more accurate information about our galactic neighbourhood and its evolution. Gaia was successfully launched on December 19. After a month's transit, it is now in orbit at about 1.5 million km away from Earth. By virtue of its position opposite the Sun from the Earth and its large sunshield, it will be able to see objects as close as 45\u2070 from the Sun, allowing it to spot asteroids with orbits that lie between the Earth and the Sun, which are candidates for Earth collision, and very difficult to observe from the ground. Staff on the ground are conducting in-orbit testing, during which the exact orbital parameters are determined, and all systems are tested for performance. Calibration images have been obtained, and the ground team is working on procedures to resolve a few remaining issues, such as reducing contamination on the CCDs and dealing with sunlight diffracted around the sun-shield. Beyond the alert system allowing quick ground-based follow up, the first proper Gaia catalogue will take two years to complete and will be made available to the wider scientific community. Following this, new iterations will be issued about once a year, which will add more precisely determined characteristics of these objects. It is expected that Gaia's database will have many new discoveries waiting to be mined from it, fuelling astronomers for decades to come.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2014-02-largest-space-camera-ready-billion.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Astrium has finalised preparation of Gaia, the star mapper", "date": "2013-12-11", "content": "Astrium, the world's second largest space company, has finalised its preparation of Gaia in Kourou, French Guiana.

Its first test image shows a dense cluster of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.

To maximise the key science of the mission, only small 'cut-outs' centred on each of the stars it detects will be sent back to Earth for analysis. This test picture, taken as part of commissioning the mission to 'fine tune' the behaviour of the instruments, is one of the first proper 'images' to be seen from Gaia, but ironically, it will also be one of the last. Professor Gerry Gilmore, from the University of Cambridge and UK Principal Investigator for Gaia, said: 'Seeing the first magnificent images from Gaia's UK-built billion pixel camera first of all generates a huge vote of thanks to all those scientists and engineers who have worked so hard to make this happen. 'Second, it provides just a tiny taste of the excellence and challenges ahead, to turn Gaia data into human understanding of the Milky Way's origins.

UK participation in the mission is funded by the UK Space Agency and scientists and engineers from around the UK have played key roles in the design and build of Gaia. Dr Chris Castelli, Acting Director of Technology, Science and Exploration at the UK Space Agency, said: 'Gaia is an important space mission for the UK; we've won around \u20ac80 million of contracts from the European Space Agency to build the spacecraft and are providing a state of the art data centre that will turn the mission's raw data into the largest stellar catalogue ever made.'

To achieve its goal, Gaia will spin slowly, sweeping its two telescopes across the entire sky and focusing the light from their separate fields simultaneously onto a single digital camera - the largest ever flown in space, with nearly a billion pixels. But first, the telescopes must be aligned and focused, along with precise calibration of the instruments, a painstaking procedure that will take several months before Gaia is ready to enter its five-year operational phase. While all one billion of Gaia's target stars will have been observed during the first six months of operations, repeated observations over five years will be needed to measure their tiny movements to allow astronomers to determine their distances and motions through space. As a result, Gaia's final catalogue will not be released until three years after the end of the nominal five-year mission. Intermediate data releases will be made, however, and if rapidly changing objects such as supernovae are detected, alerts will be released within hours of data processing, its operators say.

The European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft aimed its gaze a dense young cluster of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud for its first test image, which ESA officials unveiled Feb. 6. As amazing as the picture is, it only covers an area less than 1 percent of Gaia's full field of view, ESA officials added. Gaia launched into space on Dec. 19 and it will spend five years studying the precise positions, motions and properties of 1 billion stars in the Milky Way, with the goal of creating the most accurate 3D map to date of our home galaxy. ESA officials have said the $1 billion (740 million euros) mission will help scientists better understand the history and formation of the universe. To carry out this daunting task, Gaia's surveying instruments must be precisely calibrated. And to help bring Gaia into its fully operational phase, the mission team members have been downloading test images from the camera, like this inaugural shot of the galaxy cluster NGC1818, which lies in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way some 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Gaia has two telescopes that can stare out at two different patches of the sky simultaneously. The light from both telescopes is fed to Gaia's camera, which is the highest-resolution image sensor ever flown in space with about 1 billion pixels.

With the help of two onboard telescopes focused onto the largest ever space camera, Gaia is estimated to catalogue nearly one billion stars in its 5-year mission. Like Hipparcos before it, ESA's Gaia will map stars in the Milky Way. It will do this by measuring the brightest billion objects and determine their three-dimensional distribution and velocities. It also has the ability to measure the temperature, mass, and chemical composition of these billion objects. Gaia will be able to discern objects up to 400,000 times dimmer than those visible to the naked eye. The positional accuracy of its measurements are akin to measuring the width of a human hair at a distance of 500 km. The process will involve scanning each part of the sky an average of 70 times over its five-year mission lifetime, which means scanning the entire sky twice every 63 days, once through each of the two telescopes, making it a powerful tool for spotting time-evolving phenomena such as binary systems, supernovae, and exoplanets. Compared to Hipparcos, Gaia will be able to measure 500 times the number of stars, extending to objects 1000 times dimmer than the dimmest that Hipparcos could catalogue. The technology that makes this possible is the largest camera ever launched into space - 940 million pixels. That is why a lot of effort before launch was on figuring out exactly how to get the huge amount of data Gaia will produce back down to Earth. When a picture is taken a number of charged-coupled devices (CCDs) - the stuff most digital camera sensors are made off - are dedicated to spotting objects before they fall onto the main focal plane. This allows the instrument to track the objects as they pass and only retain small regions around the object, reducing the file-size needed to be sent to Earth. In five years it will send only 100 TB of data (1 TB is 1000 GB). Once the data arrives to Earth, there is a system in place to analyse the data and distribute alerts to ground-based observatories if anything quickly evolving and potentially interesting is spotted, such as supernovae. The catalogue produced by Gaia is expected to contribute to many areas of astrophysics, multiply our database of exotic objects such as exoplanets, white and brown dwarfs, and supernovae many-fold, contribute to more precise measurements of General Relativity, help to constrain the measurements of the presence and location of dark matter, and give us more accurate information about our galactic neighbourhood and its evolution. Gaia was successfully launched on December 19. After a month's transit, it is now in orbit at about 1.5 million km away from Earth. By virtue of its position opposite the Sun from the Earth and its large sunshield, it will be able to see objects as close as 45\u2070 from the Sun, allowing it to spot asteroids with orbits that lie between the Earth and the Sun, which are candidates for Earth collision, and very difficult to observe from the ground. Staff on the ground are conducting in-orbit testing, during which the exact orbital parameters are determined, and all systems are tested for performance. Calibration images have been obtained, and the ground team is working on procedures to resolve a few remaining issues, such as reducing contamination on the CCDs and dealing with sunlight diffracted around the sun-shield. Beyond the alert system allowing quick ground-based follow up, the first proper Gaia catalogue will take two years to complete and will be made available to the wider scientific community. Following this, new iterations will be issued about once a year, which will add more precisely determined characteristics of these objects.

A day later, Gaia performed an important thruster burn to set course to its destination. Last night, a critical manoeuvre boosted Gaia into its 263 000 x 707 000 x 370 000 km, 180 day-long orbit around L2.

When fully operational, the Gaia space telescope is going to create the most accurate map of the Milky Way galaxy ever conceived. It will be able to make precise measurements of about 1% of all the 100 billion stars in our galaxy, and tell us huge amounts about the origin and evolution of our galactic home.

Launched in December, the satellite has now reached its destination 1.5 million km from Earth. Engineers are currently commissioning Gaia's two telescopes and its three instruments, getting them ready to begin mapping the precise positions and motions of one-thousand-million stars. Its first test image shows a dense cluster of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Once Gaia starts making routine measurements, it will generate truly enormous amounts of data. To maximise the key science of the mission, only small 'cut-outs' centred on each of the stars it detects will be sent back to Earth for analysis. This test picture, taken as part of commissioning the mission to 'fine tune' the behaviour of the instruments, is one of the first proper 'images' to be seen from Gaia, but ironically, it will also be one of the last. Professor Gerry Gilmore, from the University of Cambridge and UK Principal Investigator for Gaia, said: 'Seeing the first magnificent images from Gaia's UK-built billion pixel camera first of all generates a huge vote of thanks to all those scientists and engineers who have worked so hard to make this happen. 'Second, it provides just a tiny taste of the excellence and challenges ahead, to turn Gaia data into human understanding of the Milky Way's origins. 'One substantial step for astronomy, one huge leap still to come.' Gaia's goal is to create the most accurate map yet of the Milky Way. It will make precise measurements of the positions and motions of about 1% of the total population of roughly 100 billion stars in our home Galaxy to help answer questions about its origin and evolution. UK participation in the mission is funded by the UK Space Agency and scientists and engineers from around the UK have played key roles in the design and build of Gaia. Dr Chris Castelli, Acting Director of Technology, Science and Exploration at the UK Space Agency, said: 'Gaia is an important space mission for the UK; we've won around \u20ac80 million of contracts from the European Space Agency to build the spacecraft and are providing a state of the art data centre that will turn the mission's raw data into the largest stellar catalogue ever made.' Repeatedly scanning the sky, Gaia will observe each of its billion stars an average of 70 times each over five years. In addition to positions and motions, Gaia will also measure key physical properties of each star, including its brightness, temperature and chemical composition. To achieve its goal, Gaia will spin slowly, sweeping its two telescopes across the entire sky and focusing the light from their separate fields simultaneously onto a single digital camera - the largest ever flown in space, with nearly a billion pixels. But first, the telescopes must be aligned and focused, along with precise calibration of the instruments, a painstaking procedure that will take several months before Gaia is ready to enter its five-year operational phase. While all one billion of Gaia's target stars will have been observed during the first six months of operations, repeated observations over five years will be needed to measure their tiny movements to allow astronomers to determine their distances and motions through space. As a result, Gaia's final catalogue will not be released until three years after the end of the nominal five-year mission. Intermediate data releases will be made, however, and if rapidly changing objects such as supernovae are detected, alerts will be released within hours of data processing, its operators say. Eventually, the Gaia data archive will exceed a million Gigabytes, equivalent to about 200 000 DVDs of data.", "url": "https://www.eutimes.net/2014/02/billion-pixel-gaia-telescope-takes-its-first-picture/"}, {"title": "Europe's Billion-Star Mapping Spacecraft Snaps 1st Photo", "date": "2014-02-12", "content": "A new European spacecraft tasked with mapping a billion stars in the night sky has beamed its first picture back to Earth. The European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft aimed its gaze a dense young cluster of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud for its first test image, which ESA officials unveiled Feb. 6. As amazing as the picture is, it only covers an area less than 1 percent of Gaia's full field of view, ESA officials added. Gaia launched into space on Dec. 19 and it will spend five years studying the precise positions, motions and properties of 1 billion stars in the Milky Way, with the goal of creating the most accurate 3D map to date of our home galaxy. ESA officials have said the $1 billion (740 million euros) mission will help scientists better understand the history and formation of the universe. To carry out this daunting task, Gaia's surveying instruments must be precisely calibrated. And to help bring Gaia into its fully operational phase, the mission team members have been downloading test images from the camera, like this inaugural shot of the galaxy cluster NGC1818, which lies in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way some 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Gaia has two telescopes that can stare out at two different patches of the sky simultaneously. The light from both telescopes is fed to Gaia's camera, which is the highest-resolution image sensor ever flown in space with about 1 billion pixels. When Gaia is fully brought to life, it will measure an average of 2 million stars per hour, which translates to about 50 gigabytes of data each day. Gaia will eventually compile more than million gigabytes of data, or the equivalent of about 200,000 fully loaded DVDs, ESA officials said. Because Gaia has such a sweeping view of the sky, it will be able to capture all one billion of its targets during its first six months in operation. But the spacecraft will measure each of its stars an average of 70 times throughout the course of its five-year mission so that astronomers poring over the data can study the stars' distances and motions through space. Additionally, Gaia will measure physical characteristics of the stars, including their brightness, temperature and chemical makeup, according to ESA. A Russian Soyuz-Fregat rocket carried Gaia aloft from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana in South America. The spacecraft is parked in the sun-Earth Lagrange Point 2 (L2), a gravitationally stable point in space.", "url": "https://www.space.com/24616-gaia-billion-star-mapping-spacecraft-photo.html"}, {"title": "Largest ever space camera is ready to map a billion stars", "date": "2014-02-26", "content": "After its successful launch in December, European Space Agency's (ESA) Gaia has now taken up its position in space and is ready to survey the skies. With the help of two onboard telescopes focused onto the largest ever space camera, Gaia is estimated to catalogue nearly one billion stars in its 5-year mission. Like Hipparcos before it, ESA's Gaia will map stars in the Milky Way. It will do this by measuring the brightest billion objects and determine their three-dimensional distribution and velocities. It also has the ability to measure the temperature, mass, and chemical composition of these billion objects. Gaia will be able to discern objects up to 400,000 times dimmer than those visible to the naked eye. The positional accuracy of its measurements are akin to measuring the width of a human hair at a distance of 500 km. The process will involve scanning each part of the sky an average of 70 times over its five-year mission lifetime, which means scanning the entire sky twice every 63 days, once through each of the two telescopes, making it a powerful tool for spotting time-evolving phenomena such as binary systems, supernovae, and exoplanets. Compared to Hipparcos, Gaia will be able to measure 500 times the number of stars, extending to objects 1000 times dimmer than the dimmest that Hipparcos could catalogue. The technology that makes this possible is the largest camera ever launched into space - 940 million pixels. That is why a lot of effort before launch was on figuring out exactly how to get the huge amount of data Gaia will produce back down to Earth. When a picture is taken a number of charged-coupled devices (CCDs) - the stuff most digital camera sensors are made off - are dedicated to spotting objects before they fall onto the main focal plane. This allows the instrument to track the objects as they pass and only retain small regions around the object, reducing the file-size needed to be sent to Earth. In five years it will send only 100 TB of data (1 TB is 1000 GB). Once the data arrives to Earth, there is a system in place to analyse the data and distribute alerts to ground-based observatories if anything quickly evolving and potentially interesting is spotted, such as supernovae. The catalogue produced by Gaia is expected to contribute to many areas of astrophysics, multiply our database of exotic objects such as exoplanets, white and brown dwarfs, and supernovae many-fold, contribute to more precise measurements of General Relativity, help to constrain the measurements of the presence and location of dark matter, and give us more accurate information about our galactic neighbourhood and its evolution. Gaia was successfully launched on December 19. After a month's transit, it is now in orbit at about 1.5 million km away from Earth. By virtue of its position opposite the Sun from the Earth and its large sunshield, it will be able to see objects as close as 45\u2070 from the Sun, allowing it to spot asteroids with orbits that lie between the Earth and the Sun, which are candidates for Earth collision, and very difficult to observe from the ground. Staff on the ground are conducting in-orbit testing, during which the exact orbital parameters are determined, and all systems are tested for performance. Calibration images have been obtained, and the ground team is working on procedures to resolve a few remaining issues, such as reducing contamination on the CCDs and dealing with sunlight diffracted around the sun-shield. Beyond the alert system allowing quick ground-based follow up, the first proper Gaia catalogue will take two years to complete and will be made available to the wider scientific community. Following this, new iterations will be issued about once a year, which will add more precisely determined characteristics of these objects. It is expected that Gaia's database will have many new discoveries waiting to be mined from it, fuelling astronomers for decades to come.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2014-02-largest-space-camera-ready-billion.html"}, {"title": "Europe's Gaia telescope grapples with stray light", "date": "2014-06-18", "content": "The orbiting Gaia telescope will lose some performance because stray light is getting inside the observatory, the European Space Agency (Esa) says.

Gaia lifted off at 9.12am UTC (6.12am in French Guiana). On that day, many members of the lab watched the event live on TV and celebrated the successful launch with a champagne breakfast in the MSSL Common Room. A year on and we were back in the MSSL Common Room, celebrating Gaia's first birthday in space. The centrepiece of the party was a fantastic Gaia-shaped cake, decorated to look like Gaia (see Figures 1 and 2), made by MSSL chef Sue Ford. On a big screen in the background, the Gaia launch TV coverage was replayed. This brought back great memories of the launch, particularly for George and Howard, who were in French Guiana to watch the launch in person (see here for more details of their trip). MSSL Gaia scientist and party organizer, George Seabroke, gave a speech detailing MSSL's involvement in Gaia (see the Gaia tab on the MSSL Gaia webpage for more details). Over the last seven years, the MSSL Gaia team has developed about half of the on-ground pipeline to process Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra. The current MSSL Gaia team consists of Mark Cropper (PI and head of MSSL Astro Group), Steve Baker (Project Manager and head of MSSL Software Engineering Group), George Seabroke (member of MSSL Astro Group) and members of the MSSL Software Engineering Group: Howard Huckle, Mike Smith, Kevin Benson and Chris Dolding. This team helped to commission RVS (see the ESA Gaia Blog for more details). Since then further optimisations have already achieved end of mission specification for radial velocity accuracy of bright stars. In its first year of observations, Gaia-RVS has collected over 3.5 billion spectra, making it already the largest spectroscopic survey in history!

This powerful event, now named Gaia14aaa, took place in a distant galaxy some 500 million light-years away, and was revealed via a sudden rise in the galaxy's brightness between two Gaia observations separated by 1 month. Gaia, which began its scientific work on 25 July, repeatedly scans the entire sky, so that each of the roughly billion stars in the final catalogue will be examined an average of 70 times over the next 5 years. This kind of repeated survey comes in handy for studying the changeable nature of the sky,\" comments Simon Hodgkin from the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, UK. Many astronomical sources are variable: some exhibit a regular pattern, with a periodically rising and declining brightness, while others may undergo sudden and dramatic changes. As Gaia goes back to each patch of the sky over and over, we have a chance to spot thousands of 'guest stars' on the celestial tapestry, notes Dr Hodgkin.

After launch on 19 December 2013 and a six-month long in-orbit commissioning period, the satellite started routine scientific operations on 25 July 2014. Located at the Lagrange point L2, 1.5 million km from Earth, Gaia surveys stars and many other astronomical objects as it spins, observing circular swathes of the sky. By repeatedly measuring the positions of the stars with extraordinary accuracy, Gaia can tease out their distances and motions through the Milky Way galaxy. For the first 28 days, Gaia operated in a special scanning mode that sampled great circles on the sky, but always including the ecliptic poles. This meant that the satellite observed the stars in those regions many times, providing an invaluable database for Gaia's initial calibration. At the end of that phase, on 21 August 2014, Gaia commenced its main survey operation, employing a scanning law designed to achieve the best possible coverage of the whole sky. Since the start of its routine phase, the satellite recorded 272 billion positional or astrometric measurements 54.4 billion brightness or photometric data points, and 5.4 billion spectra. The Gaia team have spent a busy year processing and analysing these data, en route towards the development of Gaia's main scientific products, consisting of enormous public catalogues of the positions, distances, motions and other properties of more than a billion stars. Because of the immense volumes of data and their complex nature, this requires a huge effort from expert scientists and software developers distributed across Europe, combined in Gaia's Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC). \"The past twelve months have been very intense, but we are getting to grips with the data, and are looking forward to the next four years of nominal operations,\" says Timo Prusti, Gaia project scientist at ESA. \"We are just a year away from Gaia's first scheduled data release, an intermediate catalogue planned for the summer of 2016. With the first year of data in our hands, we are now halfway to this milestone, and we're able to present a few preliminary snapshots to show that the spacecraft is working well and that the data processing is on the right track.\" As one example of the ongoing validation, the Gaia team has been able to measure the parallax for an initial sample of two million stars. Parallax is the apparent motion of a star against a distant background observed over the period of a year and resulting from the Earth's real motion around the Sun; this is also observed by Gaia as it orbits the Sun alongside Earth. But parallax is not the only movement seen by Gaia: the stars are also really moving through space, which is called proper motion. Gaia has made an average of roughly 14 measurements of each star on the sky thus far, but this is generally not enough to disentangle the parallax and proper motions. To overcome this, the scientists have combined Gaia data with positions extracted from the Tycho-2 catalogue, based on data taken between 1989 and 1993 by Gaia's predecessor, the Hipparcos satellite. This restricts the sample to just two million out of the more than one billion that Gaia has observed so far, but yields some useful early insights into the quality of its data. The nearer a star is to the Sun, the larger its parallax, and thus the parallax measured for a star can be used to determine its distance. In turn, the distance can be used to convert the apparent brightness of the star into its true brightness or 'absolute luminosity'. Astronomers plot the absolute luminosities of stars against their temperatures - which are estimated from the stars' colours - to generate a 'Hertzsprung-Russell diagram', named for the two early 20th century scientists who recognised that such a diagram could be used as a tool to understand stellar evolution. \"Our first Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, with absolute luminosities based on Gaia's first year and the Tycho-2 catalogue, and colour information from ground-based observations, gives us a taste of what the mission will deliver in the coming years,\" says Lennart Lindegren, professor at the University of Lund and one of the original proposers of the Gaia mission. As Gaia has been conducting its repeated scans of the sky to measure the motions of stars, it has also been able to detect whether any of them have changed their brightness, and in doing so, has started to discover some very interesting astronomical objects. Gaia has detected hundreds of transient sources so far, with a supernova being the very first on 30 August 2014. These detections are routinely shared with the community at large as soon as they are spotted in the form of 'Science Alerts', enabling rapid follow-up observations to be made using ground-based telescopes in order to determine their nature. One transient source was seen undergoing a sudden and dramatic outburst that increased its brightness by a factor of five. It turned out that Gaia had discovered a so-called 'cataclysmic variable', a system of two stars in which one, a hot white dwarf, is devouring mass from a normal stellar companion, leading to outbursts of light as the material is swallowed. The system also turned out to be an eclipsing binary, in which the relatively larger normal star passes directly in front of the smaller, but brighter white dwarf, periodically obscuring the latter from view as seen from Earth. Unusually, both stars in this system seem to have plenty of helium and little hydrogen. Gaia's discovery data and follow-up observations may help astronomers to understand how the two stars lost their hydrogen. Gaia has also discovered a multitude of stars whose brightness undergoes more regular changes over time. Many of these discoveries were made between July and August 2014, as Gaia performed many subsequent observations of a few patches of the sky close to the ecliptic poles. This closely sampled sequence of observations made it possible to find and study variable stars located in these regions. Located close to the south ecliptic pole is the famous Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf galaxy and close companion of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Gaia has delivered detailed light curves for dozens of RR Lyrae type variable stars in the LMC, and the fine details revealed in them testify to the very high quality of the data. Another curious object covered during the same mission phase is the Cat's Eye Nebula, a planetary nebula also known as NGC 6543, which lies close to the north ecliptic pole. Planetary nebulae are formed when the outer layers of an aging low-mass star are ejected and interact with the surrounding interstellar medium, leaving behind a compact white dwarf. Gaia made over 200 observations of the Cat's Eye Nebula, and registered over 84 000 detections that accurately trace out the intricate gaseous filaments that such objects are famous for. As its observations continue, Gaia will be able to see the expansion of the nebular knots in this and other planetary nebulae. Closer to home, Gaia has detected a wealth of asteroids, the small rocky bodies that populate our solar system, mainly between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Because they are relatively nearby and orbiting the Sun, asteroids appear to move against the stars in astronomical images, appearing in one snapshot of a given field, but not in images of the same field taken at later times. Gaia scientists have developed special software to look for these 'outliers', matching them with the orbits of known asteroids in order to remove them from the data being used to study stars. But in turn, this information will be used to characterise known asteroids and to discover thousands of new ones. Finally, in addition to the astrometric and photometric measurements being made by Gaia, it has been collecting spectra for many stars. The basic use of these data is to determine the motions of the stars along the line-of-sight by measuring slight shifts in the positions of absorption lines in their spectra due to the Doppler shift. But in the spectra of some hot stars, Gaia has also seen absorption lines from gas in foreground interstellar material, which will allow the scientists to measure its distribution. \"These early proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the quality of the data collected with Gaia so far and the capabilities of the processing pipeline. The final data products are not quite ready yet, but we are working hard to provide the first of them to the community next year.

The first product of their efforts will be a public data release scheduled for 14 September. \"The spacecraft is working well and the data processing is on the right track,\" says Timo Prusti, ESA's project scientist for Gaia. \"Most of the spacecraft systems that are crucial for the success of our mission have behaved as well as, or even better than, expected. \"These include the focal plane assembly, onboard data handling system, onboard detection of sources, the phased array antenna, and the attitude control and micro-propulsion subsystems.\" Nevertheless, the first two years of Gaia operations have not been without their challenges. A few largely unforeseen problems have occurred, requiring detailed, ongoing investigations by teams from ESA, industry and the DPAC. One problem detected early in the commissioning phase was associated with water freezing on some parts of the optics, causing a reduction in the sensitivity of the telescopes. The mission team expected some water to be trapped in the spacecraft before launch, followed by freezing once the spacecraft reached orbit and started to outgas. Gaia's mirrors were already equipped with heaters to take care of this. However, the amount of ice was much more than expected and the ice deposits survived the heating procedure that took place early in the mission. \"During the commissioning phase, we noticed that there was a rapid drop in transmission from the mirrors, but this disappeared when the affected optics were heated to remove the ice,\" says Prusti. \"This process of decontamination has now taken place a couple of times, and after each occasion the optics have remained clear for longer periods of time. \"The last heating operation took place in June 2015, and only now is the contamination beginning to return very slowly. However, this is not a major setback, since Gaia can still detect objects down to magnitude 20.5, compared with its optimal detection of stars at magnitude 20.7 [1]. We plan to decontaminate the mirror again in the near future, but we are confident that we have now largely solved this problem, and the impact on the overall mission outcome is minimal.\" A second complication is caused by stray light infiltrating into Gaia's focal plane at a level higher than predicted before launch. Light from very bright stars and the Milky Way is reflected onto the focal plane, but the more serious stray light is coming from sunlight being scattered by minute fibres around the edge of the insulating blanket that covers Gaia's 10 m diameter sunshield. \"This results in higher background 'noise' in the data,\" explains Prusti. \"This is irrelevant for observations of brighter stars, but more significant for fainter stars. We can still easily detect stars of magnitude 20, but the stray light means that we can pinpoint locations of faint stars to an accuracy of 500 microarcseconds [2] instead of the planned 300 microarcseconds. However, it is important to stress that, despite this 'noise', Gaia is still the most accurate star mapper ever built.\" Another surprise is a series of minor mechanical vibrations which Timo Prusti dubs 'micro-clanks'. \"Thermal expansion and contraction effects are seen on all spacecraft, which results in so-called 'clanks',\" he says. \"The mechanical changes on Gaia are much smaller than normal, and the only reason we can detect them is because its attitude control system is so sensitive. \"We have discovered that the micro-clanks cause minute structural changes within the spacecraft which lead to tiny discontinuities in the rotation angle of the spacecraft. They result in small inaccuracies in the timing and positions of the stars as they pass across Gaia's array of CCDs. \"However, we are not too worried about this because we can see when it is happening and we know how to fix it. New software will be implemented next year to remove the effect from the data.\" A similar effect is caused by micrometeorites, specks of space dust that strike the spacecraft at high speed. However, this environmental hazard was well understood and predicted before launch. \"Fairly large impacts may occur a few times each month,\" says Jansen. \"If they change the spacecraft's rotation rate by more than 10 milliarcseconds per second, they can adversely affect the science data, but such events are rare and their impact on the overall science data return is very small.\" Finally, the Gaia team has been analysing data from a laser device called the 'basic angle monitor'. The instrument is designed to measure, with an extremely high level of accuracy, any variations in the angle of separation between Gaia's two telescopes. This is necessary in order to correct for expected periodic variations in the separation angle caused by thermal changes in the payload as Gaia spins. Knowing this basic angle to an accuracy of 0.5 microarcseconds every 15 minutes is crucial in order to achieve absolute global astrometry - mapping of stellar positions - and it is an essential requirement in the data analysis process. However, during commissioning, it was noted that the basic angle fluctuates periodically, at a level more than 100 times greater than expected. Careful investigation has concluded that the variation is probably caused by thermal expansion and contraction resulting from some solar heat reaching the payload via the service module. \"We have confirmed that the basic angle monitor is operating properly and we have been able to model the effect on the ground,\" says Jansen. \"This shows that there is a regular pattern of basic angle variation during each rotation of the spacecraft. \"The spacecraft operations have been tuned to ensure a constant amount of solar heating in order to minimise thermoelastic variations.\" \"We have taken the basic angle variation into account while processing the data for the first data release in September and we are continuing efforts to develop software that will largely eliminate the problem for future data releases,\" says Prusti. The past two years have been a steep learning curve for all of the Gaia team, especially the DPAC, which has had to cater for the unexpected anomalies by developing additional software beyond that foreseen for the processing required for the first data release. However, the team is happy with the condition of their spacecraft and confident that they can overcome the lingering observational problems to create the most accurate, detailed sky map ever made. \"Although the mission has experienced a number of technical challenges, all of these have either been mitigated by additional software and analysis, or the mitigating mechanism is known and tested but full implementation is pending,\" says Jansen. \"Overall, through the extensive efforts of ESA, DPAC, and prime contractor Airbus Defence and Space, these effects have had a limited impact on our ability to achieve the mission's original science objectives.\" \"We are confident that we shall still be able to analyse more than one billion stars, measuring each star's position and motion up to 100 times more accurately than Gaia's predecessor Hipparcos,\" says Prusti.", "url": "https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/58135-gaia-s-second-anniversary-marked-by-successes-and-challenges"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "GAIA'S SECOND ANNIVERSARY MARKED BY SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES", "date": "2016-08-16", "content": "Operating in the depths of space, far beyond the Moon's orbit, ESA's Gaia spacecraft has now completed two years of a planned five-year survey of the sky.

Gaia: a five year mission to map a billion stars from the depths of space - far beyond the Moon's orbit. It is measuring motion, luminosity, temperature and composition of the stars.

Understanding the past and future motions of stars is a key goal of Gaia as it collects precise data on stellar positions and motions over its five-year mission. After 14 months, the first catalog of more than a billion stars was recently released, which included the distances and the motions across the sky for more than two million stars.

So far, the motions relative to the Sun of more than 300,000 stars have been traced through the Galaxy and their closest approach determined for up to five million years in the past and future. Of them, 97 stars were found that will pass within 150 trillion kilometers, while 16 come within about 60 trillion km.

The speed of its passage means it will have plenty of time to exert its gravitational influence on bodies in the Oort Cloud, potentially sending showers of comets into the Solar System.

The achieved accuracy is better than anything previously measured for a galaxy beyond the Milky Way. The motions provide a field test of the currently-accepted cosmological model and also measure the trajectory of the galaxy through space. The results are published in Nature Astronomy. Astronomers from the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute and Leiden Observatory, both in the Netherlands, used data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and ESA's Gaia space observatory to measure the motions of stars in the Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy. The Sculptor Dwarf is a satellite galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, 300 000 light-years away from Earth. Only by combining the datasets from these two successful ESA missions - produced more than 12 years apart - could the scientists directly measure the exact 3D motions of stars within the Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy. The is the first time this has been achieved with such accuracy for a galaxy other than the Milky Way. Davide Massari, lead author of the study, describes the precision of the research: \"With the precision achieved we can measure the yearly motion of a star on the sky which corresponds to less than the size of a pinhead on the Moon as seen from Earth.\" This kind of precision was only possible due to the extraordinary resolution and accuracy of both instruments.

The Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which are among the most dark matter dominated objects in the Universe.

In particular, understanding how dark matter is distributed in these dwarf galaxies allows astronomers to test the validity of the currently-accepted cosmological model. However, dark matter cannot be studied directly. \"One of the best ways to infer the presence of dark matter is to examine how objects move within it,\" explains Amina Helmi, co-author of the paper. \"In the case of dwarf spheroidals, these objects are stars.\" The information gathered about the 3D motion of stars in the Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy can be translated directly into knowledge of how its total mass - including dark matter - is distributed.

Many of these stellar groups appear to be filamentary or string-like, oriented in parallel to the Milky Way's plane, and some span hundreds of light-years in length. Exploring the distribution and past history of the starry residents of our Milky Way Galaxy is especially challenging as it requires astronomers to determine the ages of stars. This is not at all trivial, as 'average' stars of a similar mass but different ages look very much alike. To figure out when a star formed, scientists must instead look at populations of stars thought to have formed at the same time - but knowing which stars are siblings poses a further challenge, since stars do not necessarily hang out long in the stellar cradles where they formed. \"To identify which stars formed together, we look for stars moving similarly, as all of the stars that formed within the same cloud or cluster would move in a similar way,\" said Dr. Marina Kounkel, a postdoctoral researcher in the Physics and Astronomy Department at the Western Washington University. \"We knew of a few such co-moving star groups near the Solar System, but Gaia enabled us to explore the Milky Way in great detail out to far greater distances, revealing many more of these groups.\" Dr. Kounkel and Dr. Kevin Covey, also from the Physics and Astronomy Department at the Western Washington University, used data from Gaia's second release to trace the structure and star formation activity of a large patch of space surrounding the Solar System, and to explore how this changed over time. The analysis uncovered nearly 2,000 previously unidentified clusters and co-moving groups of stars up to about 3,300 light years from us. The authors also determined the ages for hundreds of thousands of stars, making it possible to track stellar 'families' and uncover their surprising arrangements. \"Around half of these stars are found in long, string-like configurations that mirror features present within their giant birth clouds,\" Dr. Kounkel said. \"We generally thought young stars would leave their birth sites just a few million years after they form, completely losing ties with their original family, but it seems that stars can stay close to their siblings for as long as a few billion years.\" The stellar strings also appear to be oriented in particular ways with respect to the Milky Way's spiral arms - something that depends upon the ages of the stars within a string. This is especially evident for the youngest strings, comprising stars younger than 100 million years, which tend to be oriented at right angles to the spiral arm nearest to our Solar System. The astronomers suspect that the older strings of stars must have been perpendicular to the spiral arms that existed when these stars formed, which have now been reshuffled over the past billion years. \"The proximity and orientation of the youngest strings to the Milky Way's present-day spiral arms show that older strings are an important 'fossil record' of our Galaxy's spiral structure,\" Dr. Covey said. \"The nature of spiral arms is still debated, with the verdict on them being stable or dynamic structures not settled yet.

Many of these stellar groups appear to be filamentary or string-like, oriented in parallel to the Milky Way's plane, and some span hundreds of light-years in length. Exploring the distribution and past history of the starry residents of our Milky Way Galaxy is especially challenging as it requires astronomers to determine the ages of stars. This is not at all trivial, as 'average' stars of a similar mass but different ages look very much alike. To figure out when a star formed, scientists must instead look at populations of stars thought to have formed at the same time - but knowing which stars are siblings poses a further challenge, since stars do not necessarily hang out long in the stellar cradles where they formed. \"To identify which stars formed together, we look for stars moving similarly, as all of the stars that formed within the same cloud or cluster would move in a similar way,\" said Dr. Marina Kounkel, a postdoctoral researcher in the Physics and Astronomy Department at the Western Washington University. \"We knew of a few such co-moving star groups near the Solar System, but Gaia enabled us to explore the Milky Way in great detail out to far greater distances, revealing many more of these groups.\" Dr. Kounkel and Dr. Kevin Covey, also from the Physics and Astronomy Department at the Western Washington University, used data from Gaia's second release to trace the structure and star formation activity of a large patch of space surrounding the Solar System, and to explore how this changed over time. The analysis uncovered nearly 2,000 previously unidentified clusters and co-moving groups of stars up to about 3,300 light years from us. The authors also determined the ages for hundreds of thousands of stars, making it possible to track stellar 'families' and uncover their surprising arrangements. \"Around half of these stars are found in long, string-like configurations that mirror features present within their giant birth clouds,\" Dr. Kounkel said. \"We generally thought young stars would leave their birth sites just a few million years after they form, completely losing ties with their original family, but it seems that stars can stay close to their siblings for as long as a few billion years.\" The stellar strings also appear to be oriented in particular ways with respect to the Milky Way's spiral arms - something that depends upon the ages of the stars within a string. This is especially evident for the youngest strings, comprising stars younger than 100 million years, which tend to be oriented at right angles to the spiral arm nearest to our Solar System. The astronomers suspect that the older strings of stars must have been perpendicular to the spiral arms that existed when these stars formed, which have now been reshuffled over the past billion years. \"The proximity and orientation of the youngest strings to the Milky Way's present-day spiral arms show that older strings are an important 'fossil record' of our Galaxy's spiral structure,\" Dr. Covey said. \"The nature of spiral arms is still debated, with the verdict on them being stable or dynamic structures not settled yet.

This makes it the first symbiotic star identified by this astrometric satellite. The finding is detailed in a paper published September 30 on arXiv.org. Astronomers assume that symbiotic stars, which are among the widest interacting binaries, showcase dramatic, episodic changes in the spectra of their light because one of the pair is a very hot, small star, while the other is a cool giant. In general, such systems are essential for researchers studying aspects of stellar evolution. WRAY 15-136, also known as AT 2018id, was detected and classified as an emission line star in 1966. In January 2018, Gaia spotted an outburst of this star and the transient event received designation Gaia18aen. Observations show that the star started to increase its brightness at the turn of November and December 2017 and it continued to brighten in the following weeks. One study suggested that it is a nova, based on the spectrum obtained by ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. Now, follow-up observations of Gaia18aen performed by a group of astronomers led by Jaroslav Merc of Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, indicate that the object is a symbiotic star. For their study, the scientists used the Liverpool Telescope at La Palma, Spain and VLT. The research was complemented by photometric data from LCO 0.4-m, PROMPT 0.6-m, Terskol 0.6-m, and PIRATE robotic telescope. \"In this work, we have analyzed the photometric and spectroscopic observations of Gaia18aen, transient detected by the Gaia satellite at the beginning of the year 2018,\" Merc's team wrote in the paper. The study found that Gaia18aen is a non-dusty S-type symbiotic star, about 19,500 light years away, consisting of a hot white dwarf and an M giant around 230 times larger than our sun. The giant star has a slightly super-solar metallicity and an effective temperature of about 3,500 K. Its luminosity, at a level of some 7,400 solar luminosities, makes it one of the brightest symbiotic giants. The orbital period of the system was measured to be approximately 487 days. As noted in the paper Gaia18aen experienced an outburst of about 3.3 mag in January 2018, which was followed by re-brightenings 100, 240, and 350 days after the event. The first phase of the main outburst had a relatively high luminosity, at a level of some 27,000 solar luminosities. The main outburst was accompanied by the increase of luminosity of the white dwarf and the decrease of its temperature, as well as by the changes in emission spectral lines, which is typical for classical symbiotic stars. The astronomers added that the light curves of Gaia18aen showcase scatter, which might be caused by stellar pulsations of the giant star with a period between 50 and 200 days. This is typical for cool components in S-type symbiotic systems.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2020-10-symbiotic-star-gaia-satellite.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Gaia Space Observatory Revolutionizes Asteroid Tracking", "date": "2020-07-02", "content": "ESA's Gaia space observatory is an ambitious mission to construct a three- dimensional map of our galaxy by making high-precision measurements of over one billion stars.

Writing in Nature Astronomy, researchers from the UK, US and Australia cited data from the Gaia programme when making the case for a dark matter halo surrounding the Tucana II ultrafaint dwarf galaxy. Accompanied by data from the Australian National University SkyMapper telescope, the team identified nine stars at the edge of Tucana II, demonstrating the system to be markedly more expansive than previously thought. \"In order to hold onto those stars and not have them be tidally stripped by the Milky Way, Tucana II needs to have a lot of mass,\" said Dr Denis Erkal of the University of Surrey. The researcher and author of the study explains that the visibly observable mass of Tucana II isn't sufficient to suspend the stars in place, and that some other invisible force is at play. It was first in 1933 that Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky observed a similar phenomenon. He reasoned that a subset of matter, invisible to the human eye, was pulling observed celestial bodies. Zwicky dubbed this type of matter that does not absorb, reflect or emit light dunkle materie or \"dark matter\". Several decades of improved technical capability have led to increasingly reliable observations, confirming Zwicky's findings. On Monday, Dr Erkal and his team applied that same reasoning to the latest data available, uncovering a deeper understanding of the Tucanna II galaxy. The paper explains that Tucana II would have to contain approximately four times more dark matter than previously thought. The newly discovered stars are approximately 3,500 light years from the centre of the galaxy, compared with the previously known stars which were an estimated 1,100 light years from the centre. The newly discovered stars are also found to have an even lower metal content, suggesting they are older. The paper suggests that the earliest galaxies might have been far larger than previously expected. The team say it would now be interesting to take a closer look at other ancient dwarf galaxies to see if they too have stars far from their centre. This research is built on freely available data from the Gaia programme. The ESA programme, which was launched in 2013 aboard Soyuz, set out to determine the position and velocity of a billion stars, creating the largest and most precise 3D map of the Milky Way to date. For objects 4000 times fainter than the naked eye limit, Gaia would measure their positions to an accuracy of 24 micro-arcseconds, comparable to measuring the diameter of a human hair at a distance of 1000 km. By comparison, Gaia's predecessor Hipparcos could have measured the diameter of a human hair at a distance of 20 km. The Tucana II galaxy is approximately 163,000 light years from Earth and is thought to have originated from one of earliest galaxy formations in the universe. The Milky Way is surrounded by dozens of similar ultrafaint dwarf galaxies and other contenders for closer inspection of their stellar make-up. The paper has also prompted questions of galactic cannibalism, the merging of two galaxies. Hans-Walter Rix, the director of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, cautioned that the proposed scenario of galactic cannibalism was at present only a theory.", "url": "https://www.skyrora.com/esa-satellite-proves-critical-in-the-dark-matter-pursuit/"}, {"title": "Third data release from Gaia spacecraft maps 1.8 billion stars in the Milky Way", "date": "2021-02-17", "content": "Astronomers from the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium have made public the first part of the third major data release from the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft. The findings, published or being reviewed in a series of papers in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, accurately mapped the position of 1,811,709,771 stars in our Milky Way galaxy, including the distances from Earth and relative motions of 1,467,744,818 of those stars. In short, the Gaia mission has provided the best map of the Milky Way to date, a tool which will be used in every field of astronomy. The spacecraft has provided both a trove of data that will be studied for years, as well numerous jumping off points for further research. The specific findings of this data release were to explore the edge of the Milky Way, measure shifts in the Solar System's orbit around the center of the galaxy, provide an updated census of nearby stars, and further characterize the two satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The third release also improves the accuracy and precision of the measurements over the second release. Gaia was designed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and is operated by a team of more than 2,500 people from 15 countries. It launched on December 19, 2013 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana and sits at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point 2, a point behind Earth from the perspective of the Sun where the gravitational forces of the two bodies are canceled out. This creates a very stable location for a space-based observatory to do precision work, a requirement for Gaia. The orbit has the added benefit of minimizing fuel usage. The spacecraft is expected to run out of propellant to adjust itself as needed in late 2025, the effective end to its mission. The latest Gaia release maps almost double the 1 billion stars of the mission's original goal, roughly 1 percent of all stars in our galaxy. To do this, Gaia was designed to be able to pinpoint object that are 400,000 times fainter than can be seen with the human eye. To make their measurements as accurate as possible, researchers made at least 70 observations of presumed stars before including them in their data. The mission is the successor to the ESA Hipparcos mission, which operated from 1989 to 1993. The spacecraft name is an acronym (HIgh Precision PARallax COllecting Satellite) but also a reference to Hipparchus of Nicaea, the ancient Greek astronomer who is credited with founding trigonometry and incidentally discovering the precession, or change, in Earth's spin axis. Hipparcos was the first satellite dedicated to the field of astrometry, the accurate measurement of the position and motion of astronomical objects. The final Hipparcos Catalogue was published in 1997 and contained positions and distances for more than 118,200 stars. Gaia was first proposed during the last year of the Hipparcos mission, given that a follow-up study would be necessary to further probe the Milky Way. It took another 13 years before the project was finally authorized, and another seven before it was built and launched. Overall, the mission has, during the 15 years since it was approved, cost about \u20ac740 million, one-fiftieth of the current annual military budget of Germany alone. To understand the importance of mapping the Milky Way today, an analogy can be made to the importance of mapping Earth over the course of hundreds of years. Exploratory voyages such as those undertaken by Ferdinand Magellan (1519-1522) and James Cook (1768-1799) revolutionized the understanding of Earth, bringing distant civilizations closer together. Today, highly accurate maps of our planet from orbiting satellites provide invaluable knowledge about the past, present and future of our home world. Similarly, the difficult but seemingly mundane task of mapping stars provides a wealth of knowledge from the physical signatures that hide in such data. There are three main characteristics of a star, position, distance and color, from which these signatures emerge. The position and color of a star are in principle relatively easy to record. If one can overcome the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere on a telescope and keep the temperature and gravitational forces on the optics constant, all of which are achieved by putting a telescope in space, one can get extraordinarily precise measurements of stellar positions. Gaia was designed to overcome terrestrial limitations, and in doing so has produced its latest map of more than 1.8 billion stars. In the same vein, a spectrometer, which finds the colors of light (the wavelengths) being emitted from a given object, is much more accurate when boosted above Earth's atmosphere on a satellite. Once the wavelengths of light being emitted are known, one can derive a star's temperature and mass. Of the 1.8 billion stars it mapped, Gaia measured the brightness in red and blue light of more than 1.5 billion. Distance and motion are much harder to calculate given how far away these stars are. Astronomers use the parallax method, measuring the change in the position of astronomical objects as compared to their background when Earth is on opposite sides of its orbit around the Sun. By observing these minuscule shifts, and employing the trigonometry of Hipparchus, one can determine the distance to an object without needing to travel interstellar distances. (This effect can be observed by holding up a finder against a static background, and using first one eye, then the other.) This process is further complicated by the fact that every celestial body is always in motion, and as such there is no such thing as a truly \"static\" background. To compensate, the spacecraft also collected light from 1.6 million extragalactic sources to provide multiple \"absolute\" frames of reference, using very bright and distant objects known as quasars. In doing so, Gaia found the distances from Earth and motion through the Milky Way of more than 1.4 billion of the stars it mapped. As an added benefit, this map of quasars is the largest ever produced. Quasars are a form of active galactic nuclei in which much of their energy is generated from the accretion of matter by supermassive black holes in their centers. Because so much of their energy is emitted in such a small area, they serve as very pinpoint distant beacons to calibrate any mapping scale. The quasar data published in the third data release, three times the amount from the second data release, is being used to study these supremely energetic objects. Quasars aside, with the position, distance and temperature of a star, a great deal of physics and astronomy can be done, the most important of which is calibrating what is known as the cosmic distance ladder. There are many methods one can use to estimate the distances to certain objects. Parallax is the only known direct method, and thus the basis for all other measurements. Other indirect measurements generally look for ways to infer the absolute brightness of a star, compare that to the apparent brightness, or magnitude, as seen from Earth, and then derive a distance. RR Lyrae variables and Cepheid variables, for example, are stars which periodically change brightness, and have a well defined relationship between their luminosity and how often their brightness changes. Type Ia supernovae are the result of white dwarf stars accreting matter up to a very specific mass, then exploding with known intrinsic luminosity in a spectacular event that can be seen across the cosmos. Because the brightness of the variable stars and type 1a supernovae can be known without knowing the distance to these stars, they are known as \"standard candles.\" The term was coined by astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt for all astronomical objects that have a known intrinsic brightness, from which the distance to them can be determined. Another method is to use the different wavelengths of light emitted from a star to estimate its mass, age and composition, which in turn can be used to estimate a given star's actual brightness. This method is most often used on the Hyades cluster, which appears in the constellation Taurus. The Hyades are a group of about 100 stars, all gravitationally bound to each other and with roughly the same age, place of origin and chemical composition. Thus astronomers can use the light from each individual star to estimate the distance to the cluster as a whole, which has been calculated to be about 153 light years away. And since the Hyades are the closest cluster to Earth, they have long been a target for parallax measurements, though the uncertainty in those measurements was very high. Such errors were reduced to 6 percent by Hipparcos and reduced by a further two orders of magnitude by Gaia, confirming that the Hyades are 153 light years away. Such correlations form the rungs of the cosmic distance ladder. The light from Cepheid variables in a distant galaxy can be compared to the light from a type Ia supernova in that same galaxy. A type Ia supernova in a closer galaxy can be compared to the light from RR Lyrae stars in that second galaxy. And RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way can be compared to the Hyades, or perhaps directly measured by parallax. Thus, distances across the cosmos are known if the parallax to nearby stars can be measured. In that sense, the Gaia spacecraft is not just a tool to map the Milky Way galaxy, as impressive as that is: it also provides a new and immensely improved baseline for mapping the entire Universe. Such a map is necessary for many fields of research in astrophysics and cosmology. Cepheid variables, for example, are not just one way to measure distances to galaxies, they are also used to measure the speed at which galaxies are moving apart from each other. Detailed knowledge of the distance and temperature of so many stars provides a better understanding of the history of the Milky Way, which in turn informs our knowledge of how stars and galaxies everywhere evolve. Gaia also measured the bending of starlight of thousands of stars that passed, from the spacecraft's perspective, behind the Sun. Like Arthur Eddington in 1919, astronomers used Gaia to test Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Gaia's observations have again confirmed that general relativity correctly describes the structure of spacetime. There have been many other achievements of the Gaia mission: measuring the orbits and inclinations of extrasolar planets, revealing that stars are being pulled from the Small Magellanic Cloud to the Large Magellanic Cloud, showing the orbits of nearby stars around the galaxy, uncovering the origin of the warped shape of the Milky Way, and finding which stars were born at the same time and place, even after they have been flung out to different parts of the galaxy, just to name a few.

It has more than 330,000 galaxies, a major advance compared to the first effort in 1957 by Willhelm Gliese. The recent observations have shown that most stars in the GCNS have circular orbits just like our Sun. In addition, the catalog was used to estimate the solar velocity, which is 7 km/s. The researchers behind the project detected 2,879 ultra-cool dwarfs (UCD) which are faint, low-mass, and relatively cold (under 2,700 Kelvin degrees, or about 24000 Celsius) star formation objects.

Writing in Nature Astronomy, researchers from the UK, US and Australia cited data from the Gaia programme when making the case for a dark matter halo surrounding the Tucana II ultrafaint dwarf galaxy. Accompanied by data from the Australian National University SkyMapper telescope, the team identified nine stars at the edge of Tucana II, demonstrating the system to be markedly more expansive than previously thought. \"In order to hold onto those stars and not have them be tidally stripped by the Milky Way, Tucana II needs to have a lot of mass,\" said Dr Denis Erkal of the University of Surrey. The researcher and author of the study explains that the visibly observable mass of Tucana II isn't sufficient to suspend the stars in place, and that some other invisible force is at play. It was first in 1933 that Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky observed a similar phenomenon. He reasoned that a subset of matter, invisible to the human eye, was pulling observed celestial bodies. Zwicky dubbed this type of matter that does not absorb, reflect or emit light dunkle materie or \"dark matter\". Several decades of improved technical capability have led to increasingly reliable observations, confirming Zwicky's findings. On Monday, Dr Erkal and his team applied that same reasoning to the latest data available, uncovering a deeper understanding of the Tucanna II galaxy. The paper explains that Tucana II would have to contain approximately four times more dark matter than previously thought. The newly discovered stars are approximately 3,500 light years from the centre of the galaxy, compared with the previously known stars which were an estimated 1,100 light years from the centre. The newly discovered stars are also found to have an even lower metal content, suggesting they are older. The paper suggests that the earliest galaxies might have been far larger than previously expected. The team say it would now be interesting to take a closer look at other ancient dwarf galaxies to see if they too have stars far from their centre. This research is built on freely available data from the Gaia programme. The ESA programme, which was launched in 2013 aboard Soyuz, set out to determine the position and velocity of a billion stars, creating the largest and most precise 3D map of the Milky Way to date. For objects 4000 times fainter than the naked eye limit, Gaia would measure their positions to an accuracy of 24 micro-arcseconds, comparable to measuring the diameter of a human hair at a distance of 1000 km. By comparison, Gaia's predecessor Hipparcos could have measured the diameter of a human hair at a distance of 20 km. The Tucana II galaxy is approximately 163,000 light years from Earth and is thought to have originated from one of earliest galaxy formations in the universe. The Milky Way is surrounded by dozens of similar ultrafaint dwarf galaxies and other contenders for closer inspection of their stellar make-up. The paper has also prompted questions of galactic cannibalism, the merging of two galaxies. Hans-Walter Rix, the director of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, cautioned that the proposed scenario of galactic cannibalism was at present only a theory.", "url": "https://www.skyrora.com/esa-satellite-proves-critical-in-the-dark-matter-pursuit/"}, {"title": "Third data release from Gaia spacecraft maps 1.8 billion stars in the Milky Way", "date": "2021-02-17", "content": "Astronomers from the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium have made public the first part of the third major data release from the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft.

In short, the Gaia mission has provided the best map of the Milky Way to date, a tool which will be used in every field of astronomy. The spacecraft has provided both a trove of data that will be studied for years, as well numerous jumping off points for further research. The specific findings of this data release were to explore the edge of the Milky Way, measure shifts in the Solar System's orbit around the center of the galaxy, provide an updated census of nearby stars, and further characterize the two satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The third release also improves the accuracy and precision of the measurements over the second release. Gaia was designed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and is operated by a team of more than 2,500 people from 15 countries. It launched on December 19, 2013 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana and sits at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point 2, a point behind Earth from the perspective of the Sun where the gravitational forces of the two bodies are canceled out. This creates a very stable location for a space-based observatory to do precision work, a requirement for Gaia. The orbit has the added benefit of minimizing fuel usage. The spacecraft is expected to run out of propellant to adjust itself as needed in late 2025, the effective end to its mission. The latest Gaia release maps almost double the 1 billion stars of the mission's original goal, roughly 1 percent of all stars in our galaxy. To do this, Gaia was designed to be able to pinpoint object that are 400,000 times fainter than can be seen with the human eye. To make their measurements as accurate as possible, researchers made at least 70 observations of presumed stars before including them in their data.

To compensate, the spacecraft also collected light from 1.6 million extragalactic sources to provide multiple \"absolute\" frames of reference, using very bright and distant objects known as quasars. In doing so, Gaia found the distances from Earth and motion through the Milky Way of more than 1.4 billion of the stars it mapped. As an added benefit, this map of quasars is the largest ever produced. Quasars are a form of active galactic nuclei in which much of their energy is generated from the accretion of matter by supermassive black holes in their centers. Because so much of their energy is emitted in such a small area, they serve as very pinpoint distant beacons to calibrate any mapping scale. The quasar data published in the third data release, three times the amount from the second data release, is being used to study these supremely energetic objects. Quasars aside, with the position, distance and temperature of a star, a great deal of physics and astronomy can be done, the most important of which is calibrating what is known as the cosmic distance ladder. There are many methods one can use to estimate the distances to certain objects. Parallax is the only known direct method, and thus the basis for all other measurements. Other indirect measurements generally look for ways to infer the absolute brightness of a star, compare that to the apparent brightness, or magnitude, as seen from Earth, and then derive a distance. RR Lyrae variables and Cepheid variables, for example, are stars which periodically change brightness, and have a well defined relationship between their luminosity and how often their brightness changes. Type Ia supernovae are the result of white dwarf stars accreting matter up to a very specific mass, then exploding with known intrinsic luminosity in a spectacular event that can be seen across the cosmos. Because the brightness of the variable stars and type 1a supernovae can be known without knowing the distance to these stars, they are known as \"standard candles.\" The term was coined by astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt for all astronomical objects that have a known intrinsic brightness, from which the distance to them can be determined. Another method is to use the different wavelengths of light emitted from a star to estimate its mass, age and composition, which in turn can be used to estimate a given star's actual brightness. This method is most often used on the Hyades cluster, which appears in the constellation Taurus. The Hyades are a group of about 100 stars, all gravitationally bound to each other and with roughly the same age, place of origin and chemical composition. Thus astronomers can use the light from each individual star to estimate the distance to the cluster as a whole, which has been calculated to be about 153 light years away. And since the Hyades are the closest cluster to Earth, they have long been a target for parallax measurements, though the uncertainty in those measurements was very high. Such errors were reduced to 6 percent by Hipparcos and reduced by a further two orders of magnitude by Gaia, confirming that the Hyades are 153 light years away. Such correlations form the rungs of the cosmic distance ladder. The light from Cepheid variables in a distant galaxy can be compared to the light from a type Ia supernova in that same galaxy. A type Ia supernova in a closer galaxy can be compared to the light from RR Lyrae stars in that second galaxy. And RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way can be compared to the Hyades, or perhaps directly measured by parallax. Thus, distances across the cosmos are known if the parallax to nearby stars can be measured. In that sense, the Gaia spacecraft is not just a tool to map the Milky Way galaxy, as impressive as that is: it also provides a new and immensely improved baseline for mapping the entire Universe. Such a map is necessary for many fields of research in astrophysics and cosmology. Cepheid variables, for example, are not just one way to measure distances to galaxies, they are also used to measure the speed at which galaxies are moving apart from each other. Detailed knowledge of the distance and temperature of so many stars provides a better understanding of the history of the Milky Way, which in turn informs our knowledge of how stars and galaxies everywhere evolve. Gaia also measured the bending of starlight of thousands of stars that passed, from the spacecraft's perspective, behind the Sun. Like Arthur Eddington in 1919, astronomers used Gaia to test Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Gaia's observations have again confirmed that general relativity correctly describes the structure of spacetime. There have been many other achievements of the Gaia mission: measuring the orbits and inclinations of extrasolar planets, revealing that stars are being pulled from the Small Magellanic Cloud to the Large Magellanic Cloud, showing the orbits of nearby stars around the galaxy, uncovering the origin of the warped shape of the Milky Way, and finding which stars were born at the same time and place, even after they have been flung out to different parts of the galaxy, just to name a few.

Writing in Nature Astronomy, researchers from the UK, US and Australia cited data from the Gaia programme when making the case for a dark matter halo surrounding the Tucana II ultrafaint dwarf galaxy. Accompanied by data from the Australian National University SkyMapper telescope, the team identified nine stars at the edge of Tucana II, demonstrating the system to be markedly more expansive than previously thought. \"In order to hold onto those stars and not have them be tidally stripped by the Milky Way, Tucana II needs to have a lot of mass,\" said Dr Denis Erkal of the University of Surrey. The researcher and author of the study explains that the visibly observable mass of Tucana II isn't sufficient to suspend the stars in place, and that some other invisible force is at play. It was first in 1933 that Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky observed a similar phenomenon. He reasoned that a subset of matter, invisible to the human eye, was pulling observed celestial bodies. Zwicky dubbed this type of matter that does not absorb, reflect or emit light dunkle materie or \"dark matter\". Several decades of improved technical capability have led to increasingly reliable observations, confirming Zwicky's findings. On Monday, Dr Erkal and his team applied that same reasoning to the latest data available, uncovering a deeper understanding of the Tucanna II galaxy. The paper explains that Tucana II would have to contain approximately four times more dark matter than previously thought. The newly discovered stars are approximately 3,500 light years from the centre of the galaxy, compared with the previously known stars which were an estimated 1,100 light years from the centre. The newly discovered stars are also found to have an even lower metal content, suggesting they are older. The paper suggests that the earliest galaxies might have been far larger than previously expected. The team say it would now be interesting to take a closer look at other ancient dwarf galaxies to see if they too have stars far from their centre. This research is built on freely available data from the Gaia programme. The ESA programme, which was launched in 2013 aboard Soyuz, set out to determine the position and velocity of a billion stars, creating the largest and most precise 3D map of the Milky Way to date. For objects 4000 times fainter than the naked eye limit, Gaia would measure their positions to an accuracy of 24 micro-arcseconds, comparable to measuring the diameter of a human hair at a distance of 1000 km. By comparison, Gaia's predecessor Hipparcos could have measured the diameter of a human hair at a distance of 20 km. The Tucana II galaxy is approximately 163,000 light years from Earth and is thought to have originated from one of earliest galaxy formations in the universe. The Milky Way is surrounded by dozens of similar ultrafaint dwarf galaxies and other contenders for closer inspection of their stellar make-up. The paper has also prompted questions of galactic cannibalism, the merging of two galaxies. Hans-Walter Rix, the director of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, cautioned that the proposed scenario of galactic cannibalism was at present only a theory.", "url": "https://www.skyrora.com/esa-satellite-proves-critical-in-the-dark-matter-pursuit/"}, {"title": "Third data release from Gaia spacecraft maps 1.8 billion stars in the Milky Way", "date": "2021-02-17", "content": "Astronomers from the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium have made public the first part of the third major data release from the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft. The findings, published or being reviewed in a series of papers in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, accurately mapped the position of 1,811,709,771 stars in our Milky Way galaxy, including the distances from Earth and relative motions of 1,467,744,818 of those stars. In short, the Gaia mission has provided the best map of the Milky Way to date, a tool which will be used in every field of astronomy. The spacecraft has provided both a trove of data that will be studied for years, as well numerous jumping off points for further research. The specific findings of this data release were to explore the edge of the Milky Way, measure shifts in the Solar System's orbit around the center of the galaxy, provide an updated census of nearby stars, and further characterize the two satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The third release also improves the accuracy and precision of the measurements over the second release. Gaia was designed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and is operated by a team of more than 2,500 people from 15 countries. It launched on December 19, 2013 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana and sits at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point 2, a point behind Earth from the perspective of the Sun where the gravitational forces of the two bodies are canceled out. This creates a very stable location for a space-based observatory to do precision work, a requirement for Gaia. The orbit has the added benefit of minimizing fuel usage. The spacecraft is expected to run out of propellant to adjust itself as needed in late 2025, the effective end to its mission. The latest Gaia release maps almost double the 1 billion stars of the mission's original goal, roughly 1 percent of all stars in our galaxy. To do this, Gaia was designed to be able to pinpoint object that are 400,000 times fainter than can be seen with the human eye. To make their measurements as accurate as possible, researchers made at least 70 observations of presumed stars before including them in their data. The mission is the successor to the ESA Hipparcos mission, which operated from 1989 to 1993. The spacecraft name is an acronym (HIgh Precision PARallax COllecting Satellite) but also a reference to Hipparchus of Nicaea, the ancient Greek astronomer who is credited with founding trigonometry and incidentally discovering the precession, or change, in Earth's spin axis. Hipparcos was the first satellite dedicated to the field of astrometry, the accurate measurement of the position and motion of astronomical objects. The final Hipparcos Catalogue was published in 1997 and contained positions and distances for more than 118,200 stars. Gaia was first proposed during the last year of the Hipparcos mission, given that a follow-up study would be necessary to further probe the Milky Way. It took another 13 years before the project was finally authorized, and another seven before it was built and launched. Overall, the mission has, during the 15 years since it was approved, cost about \u20ac740 million, one-fiftieth of the current annual military budget of Germany alone. To understand the importance of mapping the Milky Way today, an analogy can be made to the importance of mapping Earth over the course of hundreds of years. Exploratory voyages such as those undertaken by Ferdinand Magellan (1519-1522) and James Cook (1768-1799) revolutionized the understanding of Earth, bringing distant civilizations closer together. Today, highly accurate maps of our planet from orbiting satellites provide invaluable knowledge about the past, present and future of our home world. Similarly, the difficult but seemingly mundane task of mapping stars provides a wealth of knowledge from the physical signatures that hide in such data. There are three main characteristics of a star, position, distance and color, from which these signatures emerge. The position and color of a star are in principle relatively easy to record. If one can overcome the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere on a telescope and keep the temperature and gravitational forces on the optics constant, all of which are achieved by putting a telescope in space, one can get extraordinarily precise measurements of stellar positions. Gaia was designed to overcome terrestrial limitations, and in doing so has produced its latest map of more than 1.8 billion stars. In the same vein, a spectrometer, which finds the colors of light (the wavelengths) being emitted from a given object, is much more accurate when boosted above Earth's atmosphere on a satellite. Once the wavelengths of light being emitted are known, one can derive a star's temperature and mass. Of the 1.8 billion stars it mapped, Gaia measured the brightness in red and blue light of more than 1.5 billion. Distance and motion are much harder to calculate given how far away these stars are. Astronomers use the parallax method, measuring the change in the position of astronomical objects as compared to their background when Earth is on opposite sides of its orbit around the Sun. By observing these minuscule shifts, and employing the trigonometry of Hipparchus, one can determine the distance to an object without needing to travel interstellar distances. (This effect can be observed by holding up a finder against a static background, and using first one eye, then the other.) This process is further complicated by the fact that every celestial body is always in motion, and as such there is no such thing as a truly \"static\" background.

For decades it has been widely believed that the dwarf galaxies that surround the Milky Way are satellites, meaning that they are caught in orbit around our galaxy, and have been our constant companions for many billions of years. Now the motions of these dwarf galaxies have been computed with unprecedented precision thanks to data from Gaia's early third data release and the results are surprising. Fran\u00e7ois Hammer, Observatoire de Paris - Universit\u00e9 Paris Sciences et Lettres, France, and colleagues from across Europe and China, used the Gaia data to calculate the movements of 40 dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way. They did this by computing a set of quantities known as the three-dimensional velocities for each galaxy, and then using those to calculate the galaxy's orbital energy and the angular (rotational) momentum. They found that these galaxies are moving much faster than the giant stars and star clusters that are known to be orbiting the Milky Way. So fast, that they couldn't be in orbit yet around the Milky Way, where interactions with our galaxy and its contents would have sapped their orbital energy and angular momentum. Our galaxy has cannibalised a number of dwarf galaxies in its past. For example, 8-10 billion years ago, a dwarf galaxy called Gaia-Enceladus was absorbed by the Milky Way. Its stars can be identified in Gaia data because of the eccentric orbits and range of energies they possess. More recently, 4-5 billion years ago, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy was captured by the Milky Way and is currently in the process of being pulled to pieces and assimilated. The energy of its stars is higher than those of Gaia-Enceladus, indicating the shorter time that they have been subject to the Milky Way's influence. In the case of the dwarf galaxies in the new study, which represents the majority of the dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, their energies are higher still. This strongly suggests that they have only arrived in our vicinity in the last few billion years. The discovery mirrors one made about the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a larger dwarf galaxy so close to the Milky Way that it is visible as a smudge of light in the night sky from the southern hemisphere. The LMC was also thought to be a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way until the 2000s, when astronomers measured its velocity and found that it was travelling too fast to be gravitationally bound. Instead of a companion, LMC is visiting for the first time. Now we know that the same is true for most of the dwarf galaxies too. So will these newcomers settle into orbit or simply pass us by? \"Some of them will be captured by the Milky Way and will become satellites,\" says Fran\u00e7ois. But saying exactly which ones is difficult because it depends on the exact mass of the Milky Way, and that is a quantity that is difficult for astronomers to calculate with any real accuracy. Estimates vary by a factor of two. The discovery of the dwarf galaxy energies is significant because it forces us to re-evaluate the nature of the dwarf galaxies themselves. As a dwarf galaxy orbits, the Milky Way's gravitational pull will try to wrench it apart. In physics this is known as a tidal force. \"The Milky Way is a big galaxy, so its tidal force is simply gigantic and it's very easy to destroy a dwarf galaxy after maybe one or two passages,\" says Fran\u00e7ois. In other words, becoming a companion to the Milky Way is a death sentence for dwarf galaxies. The only thing that could resist our galaxy's destructive grip is if the dwarf had a significant quantity of dark matter. Dark matter is the mysterious substance that astronomers think exists in the universe to provide the extra gravity to hold individual galaxies together. And so, in the traditional view that the Milky Way's dwarfs were satellite galaxies that had been in orbit for many billions of years, it was assumed that they must be dominated by dark matter to balance the Milky Way's tidal force and keep them intact. The fact that Gaia has revealed that most of the dwarf galaxies are circling the Milky Way for the first time means that they do not necessarily need to include any dark matter at all, and we must re-assess whether these systems are in balance or rather in the process of destruction. \"Thanks in large part to Gaia, it is now obvious that the history of the Milky Way is far more storied than astronomers had previously understood.

In the case of the dwarf galaxies in the new study, which represents the majority of the dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, their energies are higher still. This strongly suggests that they have only arrived in our vicinity in the last few billion years. The discovery mirrors one made about the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a larger dwarf galaxy so close to the Milky Way that it is visible as a smudge of light in the night sky from the southern hemisphere. The LMC was also thought to be a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way until the 2000s, when astronomers measured its velocity and found that it was travelling too fast to be gravitationally bound. Instead of a companion, LMC is visiting for the first time. Now we know that the same is true for most of the dwarf galaxies too. So will these newcomers settle into orbit or simply pass us by? \"Some of them will be captured by the Milky Way and will become satellites,\" says Fran\u00e7ois. But saying exactly which ones is difficult because it depends on the exact mass of the Milky Way, and that is a quantity that is difficult for astronomers to calculate with any real accuracy. Estimates vary by a factor of two. The discovery of the dwarf galaxy energies is significant because it forces us to re-evaluate the nature of the dwarf galaxies themselves. As a dwarf galaxy orbits, the Milky Way's gravitational pull will try to wrench it apart. In physics this is known as a tidal force. \"The Milky Way is a big galaxy, so its tidal force is simply gigantic and it's very easy to destroy a dwarf galaxy after maybe one or two passages,\" says Fran\u00e7ois. In other words, becoming a companion to the Milky Way is a death sentence for dwarf galaxies. The only thing that could resist our galaxy's destructive grip is if the dwarf had a significant quantity of dark matter. Dark matter is the mysterious substance that astronomers think exists in the universe to provide the extra gravity to hold individual galaxies together. And so, in the traditional view that the Milky Way's dwarfs were satellite galaxies that had been in orbit for many billions of years, it was assumed that they must be dominated by dark matter to balance the Milky Way's tidal force and keep them intact. The fact that Gaia has revealed that most of the dwarf galaxies are circling the Milky Way for the first time means that they do not necessarily need to include any dark matter at all, and we must re-assess whether these systems are in balance or rather in the process of destruction. \"Thanks in large part to Gaia, it is now obvious that the history of the Milky Way is far more storied than astronomers had previously understood. By investigating these tantalising clues, we hope to further tease out the fascinating chapters in our galaxy's past,\" says Timo Prusti, Gaia Project Scientist, ESA.", "url": "https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia/Gaia_reveals_that_most_Milky_Way_companion_galaxies_are_newcomers_to_our_corner_of_space"}, {"title": "Gaia photographed James Webb Space Telescope", "date": "2022-03-26", "content": "On 18 February, ESA's Gaia observatory snapped NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope.
