This milestone will launch the MMA program into the system development and demonstration (SDD) phase of the acquisition program. During the SDD phase, the program will focus on developing a system that will significantly transform how the Navy's maritime patrol and reconnaissance force will man, train, operate and deploy. Ultimately, the MMA will replace the U.S. Navy's aging fleet of P-3C Orion aircraft, thereby securing the Navy's future in long-range maritime patrol. \"Today's MMA decision represents an important milestone for the warfighter and the acquisition team,\" said John Young, assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition. \"Our P-3 fleet has made major contributions to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq while also performing their core maritime mission. It is becoming urgent to replace the P-3 with a new airframe and the enhanced capability offered by MMA. Both industry teams produced high quality proposals, and the acquisition team has worked with industry to make a good decision, on schedule.\" \"MMA offers a modern, highly reliable airframe which will be equipped with improved maritime surveillance and attack capability, allowing a smaller force to provide world-wide responsiveness while potentially on a smaller support infrastructure,\" said Young. MMA will be a key component in the Navy's Sea Power 21 Sea Shield concept by providing persistent anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities, supporting Sea Power 21's Sea Strike doctrine through provisions of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. The platform will also play a key role in the Navy's FORCEnet architecture via development of the common undersea picture. These operational capabilities will be key factors in providing a sustained forward presence, sea domination, and distributed and networked intelligence.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110604042431/http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=13759"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "CFM56-7 TO POWER U.S. NAVY'S MULTI-MISSION MARITIME AIRCRAFT", "date": "2004-07-19", "content": "CFM International's advanced CFM56-7B engine will power the U.S. Navy's new Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA).

The MMA will fly routinely at 10,000-15,000ft (3,000-4,600m), where ice could build up on the winglets and degrade performance. The raked wing extension will be anti-iced to the tip, and the performance benefit of the raked wingtip will be the same as for the blended winglet, says Boeing, adding there is no cost or schedule impact. Before winning the MMA competition last year, Boeing switched to a longer-range 737-800ERX airframe that combines the longer -800 fuselage with the heavier-gauge wing and landing gear planned for the -900X.

Since naval patrol aircraft often have to spend hours in clouds and bad weather at around 15,000 ft. rather than flying over the clouds like commercial aircraft, this modification to the base 737-800 airframe would appear to increase overall performance for long maritime patrol missions.

The militarized 737 derivative-which Boeing describes as a form-fit replacement for the U.S. Navy's venerable P-3 Orion-recently began power-on systems testing on its dedicated production line at its commercial aircraft factory in Renton, Washington. According to Boeing, despite the Poseidon's outward differences from its airliner cousin-including a bomb bay, raked wing tips, underwing and fuselage centerline weapons stations and nearly 100 antennas-the P-8 shares 60 percent commonality by part number with its airliner cousin and could be built on the same assembly lines. The fuselage is supplied by Spirit Aerosystems in Wichita, Kansas, the same subcontractor that supplies the 737 bodies, and is based on the latest -800 model. The P-8 represents a radically different approach for Boeing, building Navy requirements into the airframe from the ground up, with no modification or stripping out of existing structures needed at the end of the airframe production. Using the same tooling, processes and worker training, the program has required unprecedented cooperation between the company's commercial aircraft unit and its integrated defense systems division. \"This is the long-term vision of Boeing: to build tactical aircraft in the heart of our commercial operation,\" said Mohammad Yahyavi, vice president and program manager for the P-8A, adding that this is now the blueprint for any military plane based on a commercial platform. For a 737, a typical trip through the final assembly line takes 10 days. Boeing has allotted nine times as much time for each of the five test aircraft in the system development and demonstration contract, as the airframer is expecting a steep learning curve. Keeping the P-8s from clogging Boeing's finely tuned 737 production system was a major motivation behind the establishment of a separate line (the former 757 wing to fuselage assembly line), which could also be used to manufacture derivative EP-8s. Perry Moore, Boeing's director of P-8A manufacturing operations, said he would be satisfied to see the line process a Poseidon in 45 days as the procedures are refined.

For the actual pilot behind the controls, it is an even greater feeling. Lt. Roger Stanton had the privilege of being the first Navy test pilot to fly the P-8A Poseidon in October. \"It felt awesome,\" Stanton said. \"The first time you fly a new airplane it's just a great experience. This is what test pilots are trained to do, so getting this rare opportunity was really amazing.\" Stanton, along with Boeing pilot Doug Benjamin, flew the first Poseidon, designated T1, over the Puget Sound in Washington, kicking off the formal Navy flight test program. \"It was a good day - a really good day,\" Stanton said. \"All the training I received was great. We rehearsed the flight profile many times so we came into the flight very well prepared, but it was still fun.\" Stanton began T1 flight preparation in 2008 with Boeing 737 training in Seattle, consisting of classroom courses, computer-based training and a mixture of commercial 737 simulators as well as time in an actual 737 aircraft. He also spent approximately 250 hours in the Weapon System Integration Lab, located in Kent, Wash. The WSIL is a non-motion based simulator designed to help the test team integrate aircraft and mission systems, as well as, test aircraft components. \"For the baseline P-8, it certainly flies like a 737,\" he said. \"They did a nice job of building the airplane. The interesting flying for the P-8 really will come when we have to emulate the P-3 mission - high bank angle, low altitude, autopilot integrated into our mission with missiles on the wings. It will get interesting.\" That type of flying will come later in the test program. T1 actually made three flights in October, prior to undergoing more instrumentation installation in the factory. The first flight was to check the airworthiness, or how well the modified 737 aircraft flies with all the test instrumentation. The second two flights practiced instrument approaches with a visual restrictive device. Stanton said one of the things the Navy closely monitors is whether or not the pilots are capable of safely flying the plane if they can't look out the window for visual reference. Initial testing of T1 is being conducted in Seattle. It will transfer to Pax in early 2010, where flight and operational testing will be completed by the integrated test team (ITT). The Poseidon ITT, comprised of Navy test squadrons -- Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 20 and Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 1 -- and Boeing, will spend the next 36 months flying and evaluating three aircraft, designated T1, T2 and T3. The evaluation will include extensive mission systems testing, operational effectiveness and ability to carry out the anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations in accordance with Naval Air Systems Command requirements. Stanton said the maritime patrol and reconnaissance community needs a new aircraft and needs it badly. He said the Fleet needs an airframe that's capable of meeting the requirements set forth by the Navy and that support the maritime strategy. \"Our job here is to test that capability on the Poseidon,\" he said. \"As an operational P-3 pilot, I am fully aware of the challenges facing the [MPRA] community as they try and execute their high demand mission with a dwindling number of aging assets. Testing the P-8 and getting it to the [MPRA] community as soon as possible will help alleviate some of those challenges.\"", "url": "https://www.navair.navy.mil/node/10951"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Boeing pitches P-8 variant to replace JSTARS", "date": "2010-02-18", "content": "Boeing has revealed a new version of the P-8 Poseidon aimed at challenging the primacy of the Northrop Grumman E-8C JSTARS in detecting and striking moving ground targets. The 737-based P-8 aerial ground surveillance (AGS) concept proposes to add a next-generation radar, such as the Raytheon advanced airborne sensor, plus an on-board arsenal of bombs and missiles. Unveiled at the Air Force Association's Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida on 18 February, the concept has provoked a debate between Boeing and Northrop over the likely cost of modernising the US Air Force's current E-8C fleet, and on the wisdom of arming such surveillance platforms. Boeing senior manager for airborne warning systems Jim Eisenhart claims that Boeing could deliver 17 modified P-8s for the same amount that it would cost to modernise the USAF's 17 E-8Cs with new engines and avionics. Northrop has estimated this figure as $5.2 billion, including $4.1 billion to install the Northrop/Raytheon radar technology insertion programme array. The USAF has already spent $22 billion to develop, upgrade and sustain the E-8C fleet, says Dale Burton, Northrop's vice-president for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and battle management command and control. \"Anybody thinking they're hitting parity with this aircraft for less than that I think is on a strange trip,\" he adds. Northrop's concept for a modernised E-8C also includes installing Ku- or X-band multifunction radars on both sides of the type's forward fuselage. These would create synthetic aperture radar images at the same time that the JSTARS' canoe-mounted APY-7 sensor scans for moving ground targets. Northrop has also questioned the need for an AGS platform to carry weapons, noting that the E-8C has already demonstrated the ability to network directly with weapons carried by other aircraft, such as the Boeing B-52. The USAF is likely to evaluate both the E-8C upgrade and P-8 AGS proposals as it reviews its options for the ground moving target indication mission. It had planned to replace the E-8C with the Boeing 767-based E-10A, but abandoned that programme in 2005.

Those formal operational tests will start this summer and should take about six months, but could run through to the end of the year. There have already been some operational evaluation activities that have been completed, thanks to the integration of the developmental and operational test teams. Should that all go according to plan, the P-8 will be declared operational in the third quarter of 2013. Once the fleet starts transitioning to the new jet, operational squadrons will convert over to the Poseidon every six months with Increment 1 aircraft. The Increment 1 capability on the P-8 will be an improved version of what is on the USN's upgraded Lockheed Martin P-3 Orion, which the Poseidon will replace. However, there are a host of improvements that are planed for the new Boeing 737-based jet. The first major upgrade will be Increment 2, but that effort has been split into two parts, says Boeing's P-8 business development director David Robinson. The incremental upgrade is being developed with Australian participation. The first part of that effort is to equip the aircraft with a new Multi-static Active Coherent (MAC) system, which has been accelerated to be fielded in fiscal year 2014. That will enable the fast, high-flying aircraft to search for enemy submarines over a much larger area with a network of active and passive sonar buoys. \"The major focus is on the anti-submarine warfare,\" Robinson says. \"MAC is a major portion of Increment 2.\" The other part of the Increment 2 upgrade includes the Automatic Identification System, which would allow the P-8 to read ships' transponders, plus a new computer architecture to rapidly add new capabilities, a new tactical operations centre (TOC), and a high-altitude anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system. The high-altitude ASW system, which is a collection of sonar buoys, would enable the P-8 to take a closer look at \"areas of interest\" generated by the MAC, Robinson says. \"You'd be able do both [MAC and high-altitude ASW] at the same time,\" he says. The TOC would allow a Northrop Grumman MQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) unmanned air system aircraft to coordinate seamlessly with the P-8, and would allow the Poseidon to better manage its various ASW activities and sensors. Those capabilities should become operational around FY2015. A follow-on Increment 3 capability has not yet been fully defined, but will include the ability to have some level of control of the BAMS aircraft, Rondeau says. It would also have further architecture improvements to allow for roll-on/roll-off capabilities that might enable the jet to take over certain intelligence-gathering missions currently assigned to the USN's Lockheed EP-3 Aries, he adds. It would also have a new high-altitude ASW weapon and a new \"digital, net-ready\" anti-surface ship weapon that would improve upon on the existing Harpoon missile. It might also incorporate J-series inertially-guided satellite-correct weapons and the advanced airborne sensor littoral surveillance radar.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130419105638/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-navy-to-start-p-8-operational-tests-in-the-summer-370955/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Navy's P-8 Poseidon Ready for Fleet Introduction", "date": "2013-07-08", "content": "Boeing has delivered nine P-8A Poseidons to NAVAIR as of May, part of three low rate initial production contracts issued in 2011 and 2012 totaling $5.2 billion.

The B-52 flights are part of what Pentagon officials describe as \"persistent bomber presence,\" a strategic effort to fly routine missions with unarmed bombers through the region. Pentagon officials say Vice President Joseph Biden plans to bring up the issue of the East China Sea when meeting in China with Chinese leaders in coming days. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has said the U.S. military will not adhere to the guidelines of the Chinese-described air-defense zone - and one Pentagon official called the Chinese proclamation of an air-defense zone in the East China Sea an unnecessary move. \"It heightens tensions in the region and increases the risks of misunderstandings and miscalculations,\" said Lt. Col. Jeffrey Pool, a Pentagon spokesman. Although the arrival of the P-8As are part of an expected deployment, having the improved ISR and sub-hunting technology of the P-8A aircraft in the region is a welcome development in light of recent tensions and the Pentagon's broader Pacific re-balance, Pool said. \"They (P-8As) are the most advanced long-range, anti-submarine, anti-surface warfare aircraft in the world,\" Pool said. Emphasizing ISR is a large part of the Pentagon's Pacific re-balance because of the need for long-dwell ISR over what's described as the \"tyranny of distance\" characterizing the geographical expanse of the region. The Pentagon plans to send two Global Hawk ISR aircraft to Japan this coming Spring. In addition, the Navy is developing a carrier-launched drone which will extend ISR dwell-time in the region, a developmental item called the Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program. Along these lines, the Poseidon aircraft will improve the Navy's ISR technology in the region, service officials said. The last two of the six P-8A Poseidons left their home base in Jacksonville, Fla. Dec. 3, setting their course for Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan. \"The P-8's state of the art open architecture mission system, coupled with next-generation sensors, improves the fleet's ability to officially conduct anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and ISR,\" said Lt. Caroline Hutcheson, a Navy spokeswoman. The arrival of the P-8A is part of a phased replacement of the existing P-3C Orion surveillance planes. All fleet squadrons will eventually be equipped with the new P-8A aircraft. \"We will demonstrate the ability of the P-8A to operate effectively alongside P-3C during high-tempo deployed operations. I also look forward to the P-8A integrating seamlessly with our international partners and allies-our interoperability will only get better with Poseidon,\" said Capt. Mike Parker, Commander, Task Force 72. The beginning of this first deployment for the P-8A corresponded with the declaration that the aircraft had achieved initial operational capability. \"The number of submarines in the world is increasing rapidly. Other countries are either building or purchasing advanced, quiet, and extremely hard to find submarines, and we need to be able to match that technology to be able to detect them,\" Rear Adm. Matt Carter, Commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Group, said in a written Navy statement.

Officials of the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Md., announced a $67.8 million contract to Boeing on Friday to integrate capabilities and training systems upgrades to the P-8A aircraft -- a variation of the Boeing 737-800 single-aisle passenger jetliner modified for maritime patrol and ASW. Boeing engineers will upgrade the P-8A with high-altitude ASW weapons and sensors, as well as enable the aircraft to perform guided weapons in-flight target updates, retargeting, weapon hand-off, and bomb impact assessments over the Link-16 tactical radio network. Among the upgrades Boeing will perform is to equip the P-8A aircraft with torpedoes that can be released from altitudes as high as 30,000 feet. These high-altitude torpedoes are Navy Mark 54 lightweight torpedoes with add-n kits that enable the weapons to glide through the air to attack enemy submarines from long ranges. Last year the Navy authorized Boeing to start building the add-on kits as part of the High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability (HAAWC) Air Launch Accessory (ALA) program. Aircraft normally release conventional torpedoes from very low altitudes. The HAAWC ALA turns the Raytheon Mark 54 torpedo into a glide weapon that the P-8A aircraft can release from high altitudes. As the flying torpedo reaches the water, it jettisons wings and other air-control surfaces and takes on its original role as a smart torpedo that can detect, track, and attack enemy submarines autonomously. Ultimately, the Navy plans to buy 108 P-8A aircraft from Boeing to replace the service's fleet of 196 P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, which are approaching the end of operational life. The P-3 is a version of the Lockheed Martin Electra four-engine turboprop aircraft. Last summer Boeing delivered its 15th P-8A Poseidon to Navy Patrol Squadron 16 at the Jacksonville Naval Air Station, Fla. P-8A squadrons and air crews will be based at Jacksonville NAS and at Whidbey Island NAS, Wash., where the squadrons will train for extended deployments. Navy officials plan to use the P-8A in tandem with the Northrop Grumman RQ-4N Triton Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) -- a maritime-patrol version of the Global Hawk long-range surveillance UAV. One or more Triton UAV can detect and track hostile submarines, and the P-8A can launch torpedo attacks from high altitudes. Plans call for the P-8A to operate from high altitudes to save fuel, although the aircraft is hardened to operate at low altitudes. Boeing is building the Poseidon aircraft at its factory in Renton, Wash. The 737 fuselage and tail sections will be built by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kan., then transferred to Renton where all structural features are incorporated in sequence during fabrication and assembly. The P-8A's flight management system and the stores management system have been developed by GE Aviation Systems in Grand Rapids, Mich. (formerly Smiths Aerospace). The cabin has as many as seven operator consoles. The Poseidon's MX-20HD digital electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) multi-spectral sensor turrets come from L-3 Communications Wescam in Burlington, Ontario. The MX-20HD is gyro-stabilized and can have as many as seven sensors, including infrared, CCDTV, image intensifier, laser rangefinder, and laser illuminator. The aircraft has the upgraded APS-137D(V)5 maritime surveillance radar and signals intelligence (SIGINT) system from the Raytheon Co. Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) segment in McKinney, Texas. The APS-137D(V)5 radar, which is installed on the P-8's enlarged nose fairing, provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for imaging stationary ships and small vessels, coastal and overland surveillance, and high-resolution imaging synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) for imaging surfaced submarines and fast surface vessels operating in coastal waters. The P-8A will have the CAE Inc. advanced integrated magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) system.

The UK is currently weighing whether to buy the P-8 after the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review scrapped plans to buy BAE Systems' long-delayed Nimrod MRA4 jet. With the release of the new SDSR just a few weeks away, Lockheed representatives told reporters Nov. 9 the company could modify the UK's 10 existing C-130s to fulfill the submarine-hunting mission at significantly lower cost. Lockheed pitched the idea to the UK Ministry of Defence about 18 months ago, according to Peter Ruddock, business development director for the company's UK contingent. Lockheed has done 90 percent of the work necessary to repurpose the aircraft to fit the maritime surveillance mission, he said. The last piece of the puzzle is integrating the submarine-hunting torpedoes onto the aircraft, a project company engineers are currently working. Lockheed's solution will be about 40 percent of the price of the competition, Ruddock said, estimating that the team could get the first four aircraft to full capability in just 41 months. Lockheed is proposing equipping the UK's existing C-130 with the mission system developed for the Merlin naval utility helicopter, which is capable of anti-submarine warfare and medium-lift transport, Ruddock said. Lockheed would equip the aircraft with submarine-hunting torpedoes, as well as sonobuoys and life rafts. The aircraft also has advanced EO/IR sensors to detect hostile submarines, he said.

The move was a highlight of the latest Strategic Defence and Security Review, which will see the United Kingdom spend an estimated $270 billion on military equipment and support over the coming decade. At least three Poseidons will be flying in Royal Air Force colors by 2020, Cameron told the House of Commons, confirming that the RAF will be the P-8's third export customer after India's navy and the Australian air force. He also confirmed that Britain will buy 138 F-35 Lightning II strike fighters from Lockheed Martin, confounding observers who had predicted that numbers would be slashed as development costs of the fifth-generation stealth jet threatened to spiral out of control. Instead of cutting back, the procurement tempo for the F-35B short take-off vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft will in fact be stepped up in the early 2020s as the Royal Navy's two new Queen Elizabeth-class carriers enter service. The Lightning will be operated jointly by the RAF and the navy's Fleet Air Arm. As far as the subsurface fleet is concerned, the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 revealed a steep rise in the cost of replacing the Vanguard-class ballistic nuclear missile submarines (SSBN) -another key U.K. defense program with major U.S. involvement. Although Cameron made no mention of it in Parliament, scrutiny of the NSS+SDSR document indicates that the Successor SSBN design phase will cost $5.9 billion and that manufacturing the four new Trident deterrent boats will cost almost $47 billion over the next 20 years, up from the previous construction estimate of $38 billion.

As primary buyer, the Navy contractually accounts for 111 of those planes, according to Capt. Tony Rossi, program manager for the P-8 and its predecessor, the P-3, with a program of record reaching 120. Currently in full-rate production at 1.5 units per month during production lot 10, continuous deliveries in the U.S. are being made to the Navy's 6th and 7th fleets. So far, the U.S. has 83 Poseidons in service. Over the last year, two new foreign militaries have placed orders for P-8As. New Zealand signed a contract for four last July, and South Korea ordered six in November. Both countries will begin taking delivery of their P-8As in 2022, Rossi said, speaking at the Navy League's annual Sea Air Space exposition. Norway ordered five as part of lot 10, for initial delivery in 2021. The first of nine U.K.-bound P-8As is slated for delivery this October and is currently having its mission systems installed, Rossi said. Australia has been operating the P-8A for two years, having taken delivery of their first aircraft in 2016. The Royal Australian Air Force now has eight of an ultimate 12. The second-most prolific user of P-8s, India uses a customized variant dubbed the P-8I Neptune. The country's military currently has eight P-8Is and, thanks to a recent additional order, plans to increase its fleet to 12. The P-8's primary mission is anti-submarine warfare (ASW) - the Navy \"saw that as a hole in its capability,\" so it \"made a very dedicated decision to recapture ASW,\" Rossi said. ASW was a role the P-3 Orion filled, but after 60 years, the legacy aircraft was showing its age. The P-3 filled a lot of other roles as well, though, and Rossi said the Navy wanted to make sure the P-8 \"didn't discard those capabilities.\" Poseidon would earn its \"multimission\" designation performing search-and-rescue, anti-surface warfare, maritime surveillance, standoff targeting and support, interoperable command, control and communications, humanitarian assistance missions. Housed in the fuselage of a 737-800 with adjusted wings, the main goal with the avionics is integration. \"Level of integration is big,\" Rossi said. \"The P-3 was very federated. Radar didn't talk to acoustics. Each operator looked at his own display, and they tried to fuse that within an operator's head.\" All of the sensors and weapons on the P-8 need to communicate with each other, freeing up operators to monitor and make decisions instead of focusing on synthesizing data into usable information, he said. Further, the stations are interchangeable on the P-8. While each operator might have a job and a seat, any seat's system can access any functions they need to to increase flexibility. That same philosophy extends to pilots. \"The autopilot works, unlike the P-3,\" Rossi said. That, once again, allows pilots to focus on monitoring and making decisions instead of getting bogged down in having to actively fly the plane throughout its entire mission. The P-8A is in the midst of an upgrade called Increment 3, which Rossi said has already started with the current Poseidons beginning with Lot 8 and will continue over the next several engineering updates. \"You get additional sensors that come in ... that takes work off the operator that lets the operator sit on the loop not in the loop in order to manage the information,\" Rossi said. While the Navy has no plans to buy more P-8As after 2020's Lot 11, the service is interested in working with manufacturer Boeing to make more foreign military sales and is still finishing up the P-3 replacement.

However, the willingness of Russian leader Vladimir Putin to invade a neighboring nation of 43 million with all the suffering and political setbacks that have followed signals that Washington and its allies will need to rethink every facet of their military preparations. One area that is ripe for review is the ability of allies in both the Atlantic and Pacific to detect, track and defeat hostile submarines-the stealthiest warfighting systems that Russia and China operate. Although Moscow has largely given up on restoring its surface navy to the glory of Soviet days, it continues to invest heavily in a diverse and highly capable undersea fleet.
