UK scientists and industry have key roles in BepiColombo, including construction of spacecraft subsystems and science instrument design. BepiColombo, a mission to make the most comprehensive study of Mercury ever, is due for launch in August 2013. It is the first dual mission to Mercury, with one European spacecraft and one provided from Japan. The programme is carried out as a joint mission under ESA leadership with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Keith Mason, Chief Executive of the Science and Technology Facilities Council which funds UK space science said \"BepiColombo will make the most detailed study of Mercury ever, revealing the secrets of the planet closest to the Sun - what it is formed of, how the Sun affects it and what we can learn about the other planets by comparison. It is technically challenging to send a probe to Mercury due to the extreme heat conditions, high levels of radiation and the strong gravitational pull of the Sun. A mission of this complexity reveals the ingenuity of our scientists and engineers.\" BepiColombo consists of two spacecraft. One spacecraft, ESA's Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO), will carry 11 instruments to study the surface and internal composition of the planet with unprecedented accuracy, using different wavelengths and investigation techniques. The second spacecraft, JAXA's Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), will carry five instruments to study the planet's magnetosphere, the region of space around the planet that is dominated by its magnetic field. George Fraser of the University of Leicester Space Research Centre is leading a research team from five countries to build the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS) which will fly on the MPO craft. He said \"MIXS will look at the x-rays coming from the planet Mercury to study the composition of the surface, helping us to test models of the planet's formation. X-ray remote sensing has told us a great deal about the Moon and the asteroids, but MIXS will be the first true x-ray imaging telescope to be used in planetary science.\" David Rothery of the Open University, who is the UK Lead Scientist for MIXS and Co-Chairman of ESA's Mercury Surface and Composition Working Group, said, \"The preliminary close-up images from NASA's MESSENGER flyby of Mercury this week offer tantalizing indications of a complex history of lava flows partly burying the planet's more ancient primitive crust. The high spatial resolution achievable by MIXS will be vital in order to distinguish the compositions of these two very different types of crust, which is essential if we are to unravel the mysteries of Mercury's origin and evolution.\" Magna Parva, a specialist firm from Loughborough are developing, the mechanical structure for the MIXS telescope with the University of Leicester Space Research Centre. The MIXS Optics structure is an extremely challenging mechanical engineering project that involves working alongside Fraser and his team to ensure that the science objectives of the MIXS instrument are met. The decision to involve a small, relatively unknown, flexible company in the MIXS project has brought an innovative approach to instrument design and may provide a model for UK space science projects in the future. A vital sister instrument to MIXS is the Solar Intensity X-ray Spectrometer (SIXS), led from Finland, which will measure the x-rays and particles from the Sun that trigger the fluorescence on Mercury's surface. Engineers at STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory are working on integrated circuits for reading out signals from the detectors of the SIXS instrument. These have been manufactured and testing will begin shortly. On behalf of ESA, the prime contractor Astrium will lead a network of subcontractors to design and build ESA's MPO spacecraft and the so-called Mercury Transfer Module - that is the module to carry the MPO-MMO composite spacecraft to its destination. Astrium in the UK is responsible for the structure of the entire spacecraft including the launch vehicle adapter, the complex mission analysis that will require numerous swing-bys of the Earth, the moon, and Venus in its six year flight plan, and also the two chemical propulsion systems and the ion propulsion system. An additional difficulty is that reaching Mercury and then entering into orbit requires a large amount of energy to brake against the Sun's gravity. To achieve this, the cruise and the orbit insertion phases will primarily rely on solar-electric propulsion (as tested on ESA's Smart-1 mission to the Moon), complemented by several planetary gravity-assist manoeuvres and conventional (chemical) propulsion. \"Mercury is the planet closest the Sun, making it hard to get to and so it is a technical challenge by anyone's measure,\" said David Southwood, ESA's Director of Science. \"However Mercury has also regularly confounded planetary scientists with its exceptional properties and that makes it a grand scientific challenge.\"", "url": "https://www.astronomy.com/science/europes-mercury-mission-swings-into-action/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "ESA's BepiColombo mission's costs balloon", "date": "2008-10-30", "content": "The cost estimates for the joint European Space Agency, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) double-spacecraft BepiColombo Mercury mission have ballooned only 10 months after ESA signed its spacecraft's prime contract with EADS Astrium.

The octagonal spacecraft, which is Japan's contribution to BepiColombo, and its ESA sunshield withstood temperatures higher than 350\u00b0C. This is a taste of things to come for the spacecraft. BepiColombo will encounter fully ten times the radiation power received by a satellite in orbit around Earth and, to simulate this, the Large Space Simulator (LSS) at ESA's ESTEC centre in the Netherlands had to be specially adapted. Engineers talk about the power of the Sun in units called the solar constant. This is how much energy is received every second through a square metre of space at the distance of Earth's orbit. \"Previously, the LSS was capable of simulating a solar constant or two. Now it has been upgraded to produce ten solar constants,\" says Jan van Casteren, ESA BepiColombo project manager. The improvements have been achieved in two ways: the lamps from the simulators are being used at their maximum power and the mirrors that focus the beam have been adjusted. Instead of producing a parallel beam of light 6 m across, they now concentrate the light into a cone just 2.7 m in diameter when it reaches the spacecraft. This creates a beam so fierce that a new shroud with a larger cooling capacity had to be installed to 'catch' the light that missed the spacecraft and prevent the chamber walls from heating up.

The Netherlands-based test campaign is evaluating ESA's Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO), part of the multi-spacecraft BepiColombo mission to Mercury. A highly accurate, full-scale engineering model of the final MPO arrived at ESA's ESTEC Test Centre in Noordwijk from Thales Alenia Space Italy in Turin on 29 July. It is being placed inside the Large Space Simulator, the largest vacuum chamber in Europe, which is big enough to house an up-ended double-decker bus, and can maintain space-quality vacuum for weeks on end. The LSS has been specially upgraded to mimic the tenfold increase in solar illumination experienced at Mercury's distance from the Sun. Its 19 IMAX-projector-class light bulbs are unaltered, but the 121 hexagonal mirrors that reflect their simulated sunlight into the vacuum chamber now provide a much tighter focus for increased intensity. These illumination levels are so intense that clever engineering was needed to maintain the chamber temperature within safe limits: an extra thermal shroud installed along the simulator walls has increased the flow of liquid nitrogen by more than sixfold, averaging 5000 litres of the -196\u00baC liquid every hour of each two-week test. To withstand such extreme conditions, the MPO itself is shrouded in high-temperature blankets and special coatings to help keep it cool, while its interior is fitted with a maze of heat pipes. These pipes work like a closed-loop version of human sweat glands to transport excess heat from MPO's sunward-side to a radiator facing the other way. This 2 m x 3.6 m radiator is itself protected by a unique set of coated louvres that prevent the radiator 'seeing' the hot planet below it while still permitting its heat to escape to deep space. The BepiColombo testing began last year with test versions of Japan's Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter - which will orbit further away than the MPO and so faces lower levels of heat radiated from Mercury's surface - plus the ESA-built sunshield that will keep it shaded during its journey to Mercury. This year, as well as testing the MPO replica, the project will go on to test the Mercury Composite Spacecraft, which is the combination of both orbiters plus sunshield and transfer module that will taxi them across interplanetary space using solar electric propulsion.

The spacecraft has been mounted on its Thermal Test Adapter and transferred to the Large Space Simulator in preparation for thermal-balance testing. The high-temperature thermal blankets were installed first on the +Z (Nadir) side of the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO). On 8 August, the spacecraft was removed from its ground handling trolley using an overhead crane equipped with a special lifting adapter and rotated through 180\u00b0 about its Y-axis. It was then mounted on the ground handing trolley via its -Z (top, in launch configuration) face, to enable technicians to access the +Z face for thermal hardware installation. Once the spacecraft had been rotated using the crane, the ground handling trolley rotated it so that its Z-axis was vertical, enabling the crane to lift the mounting adapter off of the +Z face once it had been unbolted. Over the following three weeks, the remaining thermal blankets were installed. To cope with the extreme thermal conditions in Mercury orbit, the MPO is fitted with two sets of thermal insulation blankets. The inner blanket, which appears metallic in the images, is a conventional Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) with 10 layers. The high-temperature blankets (white in the images) that have now been installed have in total more than 20 layers made of different materials. The outer blankets employ a special fastening technique to avoid holes through the blanket and the protrusion of stand-offs that might be illuminated by the Sun. To minimise conductive coupling between the two blankets, they are kept 15 mm apart and their facing surfaces are highly reflective, to minimise radiative coupling. The outer layer of the high-temperature blankets is made from electrically non-conducting fabric; to control the build-up of electrostatic charge on the surface of the spacecraft, conducting threads have been woven through the outer layer every 10 cm. The separate parts of the outer blanket were hand-sewn together once they had been installed. On the weekend of 27/28 August, after completion of the blanket installation, the MPO was removed from its ground handling trolley and installed on its Thermal Test Adapter (TTA). As the spacecraft heats up during thermal-balance testing, it will expand. If it were rigidly mounted to the interface in the Large Space Simulator (LSS), this expansion would give rise to large mechanical stresses. Instead, the TTA connects the MPO to the LSS interface through four bipods that are allowed to move and relieve the mechanical stresses. On the afternoon of 31 August the MPO and TTA were moved into the LSS.

The challenges forced European officials to push back the mission's departure to the next launch opportunity, when the planets in the inner solar system are positioned to permit BepiColombo's circuitous route to Mercury. The new schedule calls for launch around Aug. 15, 2015. BepiColombo will fly by Earth a year later, followed by two closes passes near Venus and four approaches of Mercury. The flybys will use each planet's gravity to slingshot the spacecraft closer to the sun, eventually allowing BepiColombo to enter orbit around Mercury in January 2022. BepiColombo's previous arrival date at Mercury was in November 2020. The mission consists of two orbiters, which will blast off together on an Ariane 5 rocket. A planetary orbiter provided by the European Space Agency and a Mercury magnetospheric probe built in Japan will cruise to the solar system's mysterious innermost planet with a sunshield and a solar electric propulsion module, which will be jettisoned after the craft enters orbit. The European and Japanese satellites will separate to study Mercury from different orbits, observing the planet's cratered surface, investigating its origin, probing its interior, examining its tenuous atmosphere, studying its magnetic field, and timing Mercury's orbit around the sun to test Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. The BepiColombo mission, which narrowly escaped a cancellation vote in 2008, has an ESA budget of 970 million euros, or nearly $1.3 billion. Other European institutions are developing instruments for BepiColombo's planetary orbiter, a contribution worth more than 200 million euros. Coupled with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's investment, which approaches $200 million, the mission's total cost is more than $1.7 billion. ESA's budget included a contingency to cover a launch delay, van Casteran said, meaning BepiColombo should not need additional funds to account for the 13-month slip. BepiColombo's cost has grown 50 percent since the mission was first approved, mostly because European officials misjudged the mission's stringent test requirements and mass. The mission's mass grew too large for the spacecraft to be lifted into space by a Russian Soyuz rocket, compelling managers to select a larger, more expensive Ariane 5 launcher to dispatch the 9,000-pound dual-satellite mission. During its mission, BepiColombo will endure temperatures greater than 660 degrees Fahrenheit. Structural models of BepiColombo's European-built planetary orbiter, Japanese magnetospheric probe and a sunshield were subjected to intense thermal testing and blasts of ultraviolet light to ensure they will survive in orbit around the solar system's scorching innermost world. According to van Casteran, BepiColombo's solar arrays, antennas and thermal control system are fully exposed to heat and solar radiation at Mercury, which is about 10 times the solar constant at Earth. A space simulation chamber at ESA's space research and technology center, or ESTEC, in the Netherlands was modified to test the BepiColombo spacecraft in such extreme conditions. Engineers must run UV lamps at full power and focus their light on the spacecraft with mirrors to mimic conditions at Mercury. A model of BepiColombo's combined configuration, in which it will fly to Mercury, will enter vibration and acoustic testing this spring, and officials hope to complete the environmental testing by July. BepiColombo would mark the first European and Japanese probes to Mercury, and the mission would be the second to orbit the planet after NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft, which entered Mercury orbit in 2011.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1203/05bepicolombo/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "BEPICOLOMBO COMPOSITE SPACECRAFT VIBRATION TESTING", "date": "2012-08-17", "content": "The BepiColombo Structural and Thermal Model test campaign has passed another milestone with the completion of sine vibration testing at qualification level along all three spacecraft axes.

The BepiColombo Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) Mechanical and Propulsion Bus (MPB) Proto-Flight Model (PFM) has been baked out in the Phenix thermal vacuum facility at ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. This process involved heating the MPB to 60 \u00b0C in a vacuum for 20 days to remove any contaminants that would outgas in space. Given the extremes of temperature to which BepiColombo will be exposed - in excess of 350 \u00b0C on the parts illuminated by the Sun, -120 \u00b0C or less on the parts exposed to cold space - prevention of outgassing is important because the outgassing products from the hot areas of the spacecraft may recondense on colder areas or be photochemically deposited on Sun-illuminated surfaces by ultraviolet radiation. Contamination of thermal control surfaces would alter their absorptivity / emissivity ratios, possibly causing an uncontrolled increase in temperature. Contamination of the solar arrays could greatly decrease their power output, while contamination of the instruments would severely degrade their optics. Molecular contamination is caused by volatiles that are released by materials such as paints, plastics and adhesives. The Phenix thermal vacuum facility is designed for small and medium spacecraft and subsystems. The facility consists of a cylindrical vacuum chamber nearly 12 metres long and 4.5 metres in diameter, with access gained through a 4.5-metre-diameter door. The chamber is equipped with a movable box-shaped shroud system and a movable platform on which the test item is mounted. This design enables a quicker throughput time as the movable platform and shroud enable preparation outside the chamber and rapid loading of the facility. Phenix typically achieves a vacuum of 5 \u00d7 10-6 millibar in the absence of heavily outgassing materials. The MPB PFM will now be transported to Thales Alenia in Turin for integration of additional equipment and subsystems.

Ending on the early hours of 14 February, this test ensured ESA's Mercury Planetary Orbiter - MPO, part of the multi-module BepiColombo mission - was cleaned of potential contaminants in advance of its 2015 mission to the inner Solar System. The bake-out took place at ESA's technical heart, ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, which includes a dedicated Test Centre equipped to simulate all aspects of the space environment. MPO will fly to the innermost planet with Japan's Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter, riding together on ESA's propulsion module. But not before getting cooked first. \"Being close to Mercury and experiencing high temperatures, the release of molecules from spacecraft materials is expected to occur at higher quantities than for normal satellites,\" explains Jan van Casteren, BepiColombo Project Manager. \"Such molecules are a contamination threat if they condense on sensitive surfaces, so we need to minimise outgassing in order to protect our delicate scientific instrumentation on the spacecraft.\" So an initial bake-out of the various spacecraft segments is essential for cleaning purposes - in this case MPO's 'Proto-Flight Model', incorporating its propulsion system and heat pipes that regulate its temperature. A new test facility called Phenix hosted the bake-out, a 4.5 m-diameter stainless steel vacuum chamber 11.8 m long, with an inner box called the 'thermal tent' whose six copper walls can be heated up to 100\u00b0C or cooled via piped liquid nitrogen down to -190\u00b0C, all independent from each other. \"This test was different from more typical thermal vacuum testing because, while the sides and top of the chamber were kept heated to around 50\u00b0C, the underside remained cooled by liquid nitrogen throughout,\" explains Mark Wagner, Head of ESTEC's Test Facilities & Test Methods Section. \"This creates a 'cold trap' where the contaminants baked off from the satellite solidify for collection. But sustaining this environment required 1500 litres of liquid nitrogen per hour - on average three tankers were calling at ESTEC daily to top up our supply.\" The test was monitored 24 hours per day on a triple shift system, with care being taken to maintain the temperatures precisely and ensure a continuous flow of data. Outgassing production was monitored throughout the test, and the bake-out results are now being analysed. A non-trivial amount of contaminants are expected to have been produced - 'spoonfuls' of material. Now Phenix itself is being thoroughly cleaned, ready for its next customer. \"Phenix was put in place to extend the range of thermal vacuum test services on offer to ESTEC Test Centre customers,\" explains Mark. \"It is able to accommodate large subsystems or entire spacecraft.\" Phenix was cleared for use last December, after which preparations began immediately for BepiColombo testing. \"The chamber will be kept busy for much of the rest of this year accommodating a forthcoming batch of Galileo satellites,\" Mark concludes. \"This will be more traditional testing - simulating the temperature extremes the Galileo satellites must endure throughout their 12-year working lifetimes.\"", "url": "https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/How_to_cook_a_spacecraft"}, {"title": "The mercury rises for BepiColombo", "date": "2013-03-17", "content": "The engineering model of the BepiColombo Mercury Transfer Module has completed a 12-day Sun-simulation test inside the Large Space Simulator at ESA's test centre in the Netherlands, where it received a taste of the extreme solar heating it will experience when it enters orbit around the Solar System's innermost planet in 2022. The image was taken during a dry run on 20 February, during which the facility's motion system replicated the different orientations of the simulated solar beam and the positions of the test table. The real test, in vacuum, began on 26 February and continued non-stop for 12 days. During this time the module was subjected to ten times the solar heating experienced by satellites circling Earth. Some of the 121 hexagonal mirror segments that direct the simulated solar radiation onto the spacecraft are visible towards the top of the image. The aperture through which the 'sunlight' travels from the nineteen 25 kW lamps can be seen just to the left of the mirror segments. The Mercury Transfer Module will carry the mission's two scientific satellites - Japan's Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter and Europe's Mercury Planetary Orbiter - into orbit around Mercury. The spacecraft will use electric propulsion to reach its destination. In this view, one of four ion propulsion engines has already been installed (the grey cylinder close to the centre of the unit), while part of the solar array drive protrudes from the right side of the module.

ESA's Large Space Simulator is now the most powerful in the world and the only facility capable of reproducing Mercury's hellish environment for a full-scale spacecraft. The Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) has survived a simulated voyage to the innermost planet. The octagonal spacecraft, which is Japan's contribution to BepiColombo, and its ESA sunshield withstood temperatures higher than 350 degrees C. This is a taste of things to come for the spacecraft. BepiColombo will encounter fully ten times the radiation power received by a satellite in orbit around Earth and, to simulate this, the Large Space Simulator (LSS) at ESA's ESTEC center in the Netherlands had to be specially adapted. Engineers talk about the power of the Sun in units called the solar constant. This is how much energy is received every second through a square meter of space at the distance of Earth's orbit. \"Previously, the LSS was capable of simulating a solar constant or two. Now it has been upgraded to produce ten solar constants,\" says Jan van Casteren, ESA BepiColombo project manager. The improvements have been achieved in two ways: the lamps from the simulators are being used at their maximum power and the mirrors that focus the beam have been adjusted. Instead of producing a parallel beam of light 6 m across, they now concentrate the light into a cone just 2.7 m in diameter when it reaches the spacecraft. This creates a beam so fierce that a new shroud with a larger cooling capacity had to be installed to 'catch' the light that missed the spacecraft and prevent the chamber walls from heating up. BepiColombo consists of separate modules. The MMO will investigate the magnetic environment of Mercury. It is kept cool during its six-year cruise to Mercury by the sunshield. These are the two modules that have now completed their thermal tests. \"The sunshield test was successful. Its function to protect the MMO spacecraft during the cruise phase was demonstrated,\" says Jan. Once at Mercury, most of the Sun's fearsome heat will be prevented from entering BepiColombo by special thermal blankets. They consist of multiple layers including a white ceramic outer layer and several metallic layers to reflect as much heat as possible back into space. \"The tests allowed us to measure the thermal blanket's performance. The results allow us to prepare some adjustments for the tests of the Mercury Planetary Orbiter next year,\" says Jan. In addition to enduring temperatures of 350 degrees C, ESA's Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) will go where no spacecraft has gone before: down into a low elliptical orbit around Mercury, of between just 400 km and 1500 km above the planet's scorching surface. At that proximity, Mercury is worse than a hot plate on a cooker, releasing floods of infrared radiation into space. So, the MPO will have to deal with this as well as the solar heat.

It will then be shipped to ESA's European Space Research and Technology center in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, to start environmental tests. BepiColombo is a joint mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA. The primary goal of this ambitious mission is a detailed study of the planet Mercury and its environment. The launch is scheduled for mid-2016 from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana, using an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. Thales Alenia Space is part of the Core Team, and coordinates 35 European companies on the work package under its responsibility. In particular, Thales Alenia Space is in charge of the telecommunications, thermal control and electric power distribution systems, along with integration and testing of the satellite and support services for the launch campaign. Thales Alenia Space is supplying the X- and Ka-band transponders, onboard computer, mass memory and the high-gain antenna, a 1.1-meter dish used for satellite-ground communications, as well as for the mission's radio science experiment. This antenna is derived from the antenna developed for the highly successful Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn. The Italian space agency and industry are also making a significant contribution to the mission, with responsibility for four out of the 11 experiments: SIMBIO-SYS, an integrated system of cameras for the observation and characterization of the planet's surface; the ISA ultra-sensitive accelerometer; the MORE radio science experiment, using the satellite's Ka-band transponder; and SERENA, an experiment that will study the particle environment using two neutral particle analyzers and two ion spectrometers. \"BepiColombo is one of the most ambitious missions planned by ESA, and has required the development of special technologies to deal with the severe conditions on Mercury,\" said Elisio Prette, Chairman and CEO of Thales Alenia Space Italia. \"We are proud to have reached this significant program milestone, clearly reflecting our ability to meet very daunting technology challenges, even for space exploration. Thales Alenia Space, working through the Italian, European and American space agencies, has made a significant contribution to major international space exploration missions for the last two decades and more. Our contributions reflect the company's high level of technological expertise, bolstering our leadership and establishing our position as a world-class supplier for advanced space programs.\" One distinctive feature of the BepiColombo mission is the development of special high-temperature technologies. Mercury is only one-third of the distance to the Sun, compared with the Earth, and the solar radiation in orbit around Mercury is estimated at ten times more intense than near Earth. The space probe will have to withstand temperatures greater than 300\u00b0C during its approach to Mercury, with local excursions on the antenna reflector of up to 400\u00b0C or more, while the spacecraft's instruments will have to work at temperatures ranging from 0\u00b0 to 40\u00b0. It was therefore necessary to develop special materials and devices for all exposed elements, including thermal blankets, antennas, solar cells and pointing mechanisms. BepiColombo is actually a composite spacecraft that comprises three modules: the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), which will propel the spacecraft to Mercury using electric propulsion; the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO), carrying the European observation instruments; and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), developed by the Japanese space agency JAXA to observe the planet's magnetosphere.", "url": "https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/space/press-release/bepicolombo-ready-shipment-esa"}, {"title": "Mercury Spacecraft Moves To Testing Ahead Of 2016 Launch To Sun's Closest Planet", "date": "2014-11-25", "content": "After facing down a couple of delays due to technical difficulties, Europe's and Japan's first Mercury orbiter is entering some of the final stages ahead of its 2016 launch. Part of the BepiColombo orbiter moved into a European testing facility this past week that will shake, bake and otherwise test the hardware to make sure it's ready for its extreme mission. Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, BepiColombo is going to have a particularly harsh operating environment. Temperatures there will soar as high as 350 degrees Celsius (662 degrees Fahrenheit), requiring officials to change the chamber to simulate these higher temperatures. Time will tell if the spacecraft is ready for the test. BepiColombo is also special because it includes not one orbiting spacecraft, but two. Flying in different orbits, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter will try to learn more about this mysterious planet. NASA's MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging) spacecraft has spent the past few years orbiting Mercury, but before then, we had very little information on the planet. (And before MESSENGER, only brief flybys from NASA's Mariner 10 in the 1970s turned up spacecraft-based information on Mercury.) MESSENGER has turned up quite a few surprises. It's showed us more about the nature of Mercury's tenuous atmosphere and it's discovered probable water ice (!) in permanently shadowed areas, among other things. The European Space Agency and Japan hope to push our understanding of the Sun's closest planet when BepiColombo gets there in 2024. There are so many questions that Mercury presents us, and BepiColombo is trying to answer a few of those. For example, Mercury's density is higher than the rest of the other terrestrial planets for reasons that are poorly understood. Scientists aren't sure if its core is liquid or solid, or even it has active plate tectonics as Earth does. Its magnetic field is a mystery, given that Mars and Venus and the Moon don't have any. And there are tons of questions too about its atmosphere, such as how it is produced and how the magnetic field and solar wind work together. The two spacecraft will be carried together to Mercury's orbit along with a component called the Mercury Transfer Model (MTM), which will push the spacecraft out there using solar-electric propulsion. Just before BepiColombo enters orbit, MTM will be jettisoned and the Mercury Polar Orbiter will ensure the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter receives the needed resources to survive until the two spacecraft move into their separate orbits, according to the European Space Agency. As for why it takes so long to get out there, to save on fuel the mission will swing by Earth, Venus and Mercury to get to the right spot.

In February, the first mating of the MTM and MPO flight modules at ESTEC took place smoothly. These two spacecraft will soon be joined by the MMO, which is due to arrive at ESTEC next month. During this period, a major review of BepiColombo - the Mission Critical Design Review - took place. This review, which examined all aspects of the design of the mission, was successfully completed on 25 March. One aspect of the mission that was examined during the review period was the launch of BepiColombo, which had been targeted for a window opening in July 2016. However, as the result of delays in the procurement of critical units and the availability of some payloads, a decision was taken to opt for a later launch opportunity in order to minimise the operational risk to this ambitious dual mission.

Already since the 2018 launch, the mission has completed one and a half loops around the Sun on its grand odyssey, travelling a distance of roughly 1.4 billion km. By they time it's emplaced at Mercury and ready to begin science observations, Bepi will have completed 18 loops and covered more than 8.5 billion km. Mission scientists switched on a number of the duo's instruments for the Earth pass, to test and calibrate them. Unfortunately, the main camera on Europe's MPO couldn't operate because of its position in the stack. But small inspection cameras to the side of Bepi did manage to grab some black & white pictures of the Earth and Moon. The next flyby will be of Venus in October. For most of the long journey, controllers on Earth will limit communication with the spacecraft to about one contact a week. \"Of course, even when we're in quiet cruise, there are some maintenance operations to be done with the satellite. So, typically, every six months we are doing a thorough check out of the subsystems and the instruments where we activate units that are normally not active just to make sure they are still functioning okay,\" explained Elsa Montagnon.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52229667"}, {"title": "BepiColombo flies by Earth, completing first leg of journey to Mercury", "date": "2020-04-10", "content": "Working with a reduced staff due to coronavirus-related restrictions, European Space Agency flight controllers monitored the BepiColombo spacecraft during a flyby of Earth on Friday, a maneuver that used our planet's gravity to steer the mission on a course toward Mercury. BepiColombo sailed by Earth at a distance of around 7,900 miles (12,700 kilometers), about one-third the distance of geostationary communications satellites, at 0425 GMT (12:25 a.m. EDT) on Friday. The BepiColombo spacecraft is made up of European and Japanese orbiters that will survey Mercury in tandem. A solar-powered ion propulsion module is accompanying the two science orbiters during the flight to the solar system's innermost planet. Some of BepiColombo's 16 science instruments were switched on and gathered data on the Earth and the moon during the flyby, providing an opportunity to calibrate sensors before the mission reaches Mercury. Small cameras mounted outside the spacecraft also captured ethereal views of the Earth on BepiColombo's approach Friday. \"These selfies from space are humbling, showing our planet, the common home that we share, in one of the most troubling and uncertain periods many of us have gone through,\" said G\u00fcnther Hasinger, ESA's director of science, in a statement. A reduced team of engineers at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, monitored the progress of BepiColombo during Friday's flyby maneuver. Scientists and managers, who would have normally been at the control center, tracked the flyby and analyzed data from their homes due to restrictions on gatherings of people adopted by ESA and government authorities. \"We are scientists who fly spacecraft to explore the solar system and observe the universe in search of our cosmic origins, but before that we are humans, caring for one another and coping with a planetary emergency together,\" Hasinger said. \"When I look at these images, I am reminded of the strength and resilience of humankind, of the challenges we can overcome when we team up, and I wish they bring you the same sense of hope for our future.\" BepiColombo's flyby of Earth on Friday completed the first leg of the mission's seven-year journey before entering orbit around Mercury in December 2025. The $1.8 billion mission launched from French Guiana aboard an Ariane 5 rocket in October 2018. BepiColombo's two orbiters will become the first European and Japanese spacecraft to enter orbit around Mercury, and will become the second mission to ever orbit the solar system's innermost planet, following NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft. \"Since it is very hard to go to Mercury, it's quite a long tour to make,\" said Johannes Benkhoff, ESA's project scientist for the BepiColombo mission. \"It's a seven-year cruise which we have to go through, so we need the help of planetary flybys.\" ", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/10/bepicolombo-flies-by-earth-completing-first-leg-of-journey-to-mercury/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "BepiColombo's First Venus Flyby - Gravity Assist to Set the Spacecraft on Course for Mercury Orbit", "date": "2020-10-08", "content": "The ESA-JAXA BepiColombo mission is getting ready to fly by Venus.
