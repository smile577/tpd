An imaginery image of the Boeing-787 jetliner. Deals included the first-ever confirmed agreement to produce parts for the brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Meeting in Beijing the aviation giant finalized contracts for the 787 composite rudder, the 737 forward entry door and the 737 automatic over-wing exit door with the Chengdu Aircraft Industrial Co Ltd, a China Aviation Industry Corporation I -affiliated company. Also sealed was the deal for the 787 wing-to-body fairing panels between Boeing and Hafei Aviation Industry Co, Ltd, a firm under AVIC II. \"AVIC I is keen to further its long-standing partnership with Boeing. As well as strengthening our own aircraft building capability with the ARJ 21 feederliner project, we also hope to grow into a global supplier for the international aircraft manufacturing industry,\" Liu Gaozhuo, president of AVIC I, said. The AVIC I boss added that becoming the sole partner on component supply with Boeing on the revolutionary 787 project was an endorsement of the Chinese plane makers' technology and manufacturing capability. \"Since large amount of new composite materials are used in the 787 dreamliner, it imposes higher demand on us as a component supplier. It is surely a recognition of our technological capability,\" Liu said. Already more than 3,500 Boeing airplanes -- one third of Boeing's world fleet -- have major parts and assemblies built in China. Boeing Commercial Airplanes Vice-President and General Manager of Airplane Production Carolyn Corvi said that yesterday's agreements showed China's growing role in Boeing's strategy of global manufacturing and production outsourcing on the 787, 777, 747 and 737 aeroplane programs. \"China's aviation industry is providing outstanding technological capabilities and resources that help us meet quality, cost and delivery imperatives in our programs -- particularly on the new 787 project,\" she said. Agreeing with Corvi, David Wang, president of Boeing China, said it was natural for aircraft manufacturing to become a global industry, instead of been limited within a single territory. Because China boasts manufacturing facilities and a cheap, educated workforce, it makes sense for both Boeing and Airbus to shift some production into the country, Liao Quanwang, deputy director of China Aviation Development Research Centre, said. Airbus, Boeing's main-rival, has pledged to offer a 5 per cent risk-sharing partnership with China on its newly unveiled A350 project. Both AVIC I and AVIC II expressed they were busy negotiating with Airbus on the A350 programme. Deals may be concluded by the end of this year, Xu Zhanbin, vice-president of AVIC II, said. Also yesterday, the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, an AVIC I-affiliated company, signed a memorandum of agreement with Boeing to build the 787 leading edge assembly for its vertical fin. BHA Aero Composite Parts Co Ltd signed memorandums of understanding to supply interior panels for the 777 control cabin, as well as wing-to-body fairing panels and the tail cone for the Next-Generation 737. BHA is an equity-share joint venture between Boeing, Hexcel Corp and AVIC I. Boeing also announced yesterday the decision to substantially increase 737 component production at Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corp, Xi'an Aircraft Company and Shenyang Aircraft Corporation for the manufacture of 737 parts, including the vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer.", "url": "https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-06/03/content_448476.htm"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "New orders for Boeing 787 debut", "date": "2007-07-08", "content": "Boeing has announced 35 new orders for its 787 Dreamliner, hours before the plane is unveiled at the US manufacturer's plant in Seattle.

The company is in the midst of a rigorous testing program with its first six 787s. The plane made three landings and three takeoffs on DIA's runway 16Right/ 34Left to test the interaction between the aircraft and runway instrumentation, according to airport officials. The runway is DIA's longest at 16,000 feet and one of the longest runways among major airports throughout the world. In November, Boeing halted its 787 flight-test program when one of the planes, on a flight near Laredo, Texas, suffered a fire in a power-distribution panel. The fire \"self-extinguished\" and the plane landed safely, according to the company. Boeing resumed flight testing of the 787 on Dec. 23. The plane, which will seat between 200 and 300 passengers depending on cabin configuration, is fabricated using 50 percent composite materials and only 20 percent aluminum, according to the company. The structure is 15 percent titanium and 10 percent steel. In comparison, the Boeing 777 - the company's newest plane before the 787 - is 50 percent aluminum and relies on composites for about 12 percent of its makeup. Boeing claims the 787 will be 20 percent more fuel efficient than similarly sized planes and produce 20 percent fewer emissions. Major assembly of the 787 began in June 2006. DIA has been courting Japan's All Nippon Airways, or ANA, to operate nonstop service between Denver and Tokyo using the 787, once the carrier takes delivery of the long-haul jet and certifies its use for trans-oceanic flights. \"ANA is still saying Denver is one of the top markets,\" DIA communications and marketing chief Sally Covington said about the airline's assessment of which U.S. cities it might serve with the 787. Officials from DIA, the state of Colorado, the city and county of Denver, and the metro Denver business community have made a number of trips to meet with ANA executives in Japan in an effort to win the Tokyo nonstop service. \"It's about having face time and building relationships,\" Covington said. \"Tokyo brings us all of Asia,\" she added, referring to the ability of passengers arriving at Narita International Airport from Denver to connect with major destinations in China, South Korea and elsewhere in the region.", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2011/01/11/boeings-787-dreamliner-flies-in-out-of-denver-2/"}, {"title": "Goodrich Completes Boeing 787 Electric Braking System certification 117310798 ", "date": "2011-03-03", "content": "Goodrich Corporation's electric brake system for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has completed all required dedicated flight test conditions.

It was not immediately clear what caused the fire or how serious the repercussions would be. But investors, mindful that hazards with the jet's batteries had led to the grounding of the entire fleet from January to April, reacted nervously, sending Boeing's shares down 4.7 percent. Smoke came from the plane, named the Queen of Sheba, eight hours after it had been parked in a remote space at Heathrow and about four and a half hours before it was scheduled to depart for Ethiopia. No passengers were on the plane, which was connected to an external ground power source, according to people briefed on the incident. It was also not clear if any maintenance was under way or how long the fire had been burning, though it was intense enough to burn through its carbon-composite skin on the top of the fuselage near the tail. That area was not next to either of the plane's new lithium-ion batteries, which caught fire or emitted smoke in two earlier incidents that led to the grounding of the first 50 787s. Unless they were charging, aviation experts said, the batteries would not have been in use if the plane were connected to ground power. A team of British safety investigators began examining the plane shortly after the fire was put out. But no one involved - the investigators, Boeing, the airline or the airport - commented on the possible cause of the fire. Other experts said that some of the plane's wiring, and the oxygen systems for passengers, would have passed through the damaged area, which was above the rear galley. It was also possible the fire migrated from another part of the plane, they said. Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation consultant at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said the possibilities ranged from \"something pretty benign,\" like a lit cigarette or a coffee machine left on, to a serious flaw in the plane's new electrical system, which includes other innovative components besides the batteries.
