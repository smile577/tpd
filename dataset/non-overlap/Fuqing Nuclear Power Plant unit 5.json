Three reactors are under construction at the site in Fujian province, while another has been connected to the grid and is soon to start regular power generation. They are all CPR-1000 model pressurized water reactors, but today it was announced by China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) that the fifth and sixth units at the site will use the Hualong One design, marking its first deployment. CNNC had previously expected to use the ACP1000 design for Fuqing 5 and 6, but plans have been revised in line with a re-organisation of the Chinese nuclear industry. In 2012 central planners in Beijing directed CNNC and the other large nuclear builder and operator, China General Nuclear (CGN), to 'rationalise' their reactor programs. This meant CNNC's ACP1000 and CGN's ACPR1000 were 'merged' into one standardised design - the Hualong One. In fact, each company has its own supply chain and their versions of Hualong One will differ slightly (units built by CGN will use some features from the ACPR1000) but the design is considered to be standardised. It is set for wide deployment in China as well as export to other countries. Some 85% of its components will be made domestically. Site preparations are well advanced for Fuqing 5, which has previously been slated to start construction before the end of this year. According to that schedule it would be in operation in around 2019. Once all six units at Fuqing are in operation their total generating capacity would be about 6300 MWe. CNNC has said this would provide about 10% of the electricity used in Fujian province by its population of 37.5 million people.

He said CNNC had already signed two export contracts for the Hualong One, as well as five cooperation framework agreements. The company is also establishing an \"overseas market development system\". Zhimin also said that CNNC is \"actively promoting\" the Hualong One reactor in some 20 countries, including the UK, Argentina, Egypt and other countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa and South Asia. Although it is still officially listed as being ACP1000, Pakistan's Karachi Coastal Power station is likely to be the first export Hualong One units. In February, China and Argentina agreed to cooperate on construction of a Hualong One reactor in the South American country. China General Nuclear said last month that it is preparing to apply for generic design assessment by UK regulators of its version of the Hualong One design. In a 21 April statement, the company said that Bradwell in Essex could be a potential site for a Hualong One plant.

The construction will start on May 7 on what will be the fifth unit of the Fuqing project in Fujian province, using the Hualong One reactor, the first domestically developed third-generation nuclear reactor design, officials revealed in Beijing. The State Council approved the construction of the pilot unit at Fuqing on April 15. Qian Zhimin, CNNC's general manager, said the announcement marked a milestone for the country's fledgling efforts at exporting its nuclear technology. \"We are at the stage of finalizing the price of our nuclear reactors for foreign buyers, and we are actively developing markets such as the United Kingdom, Argentina, Egypt as well as other countries in Africa and Europe,\" he said. China has already sold two Hualong One reactors, and closed five framework agreements with foreign countries, of which four are for Hualong Ones, CNNC confirmed without giving any further details. The company has so far sold one nuclear research reactor, five micro reactors and six nuclear power units to overseas buyers. Qian said that CNNC's ongoing plans to export its know-how also represented \"a perfect example\" of the government's strategy of developing the \"Belt and Road Initiative\" with foreign countries. Many of the possible export destination countries are along the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The Fuqing project in Fujian province is at the starting point of the Maritime Silk Road. China has embarked on a massive nuclear power program in an effort to reduce its reliance on coal. The country now boasts the largest number of nuclear reactors in the world under construction. This year six to eight nuclear units will be approved, and eight will go online. Nuclear power generation currently accounts for 2.39 percent of the nation's total power generation, according to the China Nuclear Energy Association. In the future officials hope to leverage its growing domestic experience to export not only home-grown nuclear technology but also its manufacturing capacity. Qian estimated the export value of every nuclear unit of the Hualong One design at around 30 billion yuan ($4.8 billion), the equivalent of selling 300,000 automobiles. But that increases to 100 billion yuan if fuel supply and technical support are included. Xing Ji, chief designer of Hualong One, said that 85 percent of the equipment for the reactors has been developed in China, and once into mass production, about 95 percent of the equipment used will be supplied by Chinese firms. He said that the project will follow the very highest international safety standards using features such as double-layer safety shells that can withstand the impact of a large commercial airplane. \"We have improved all the existing emergency plans to ensure safety during construction and operation,\" he said. CNNC, together with its largest peer China General Nuclear Corp, are already in a consortium to invest in two nuclear reactors using Europe-designed EPR technology at Hinkley Point C in southwest England.

The country is now able to manufacture major equipment for 8 to 10 third-generation nuclear power plants. According to Zhao Hao, general manager of Fujian Fuqing Nuclear Power Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, the commercial operation of Hualong One will likely generate nearly 10 billion kWh of electricity each year, potentially reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 8.16 million tonnes and standard coal consumption by 3.12 million tonnes in annual terms. It is also an equivalent to plantation of over 70 million trees annually. The reactor has a profound significance for China to improve its energy structure, peak carbon dioxide emissions, and achieve carbon neutrality. From being commenced in Fuqing on May 7, 2015, to the commercial operation on Jan. 30 this year, the No. 5 unit saves 20 to 30 percent of cost compared with similar projects abroad. This makes Hualong One one of the most popular third- generation reactors in the world. Two Hualong One projects are currently under construction in Karachi, Pakistan, and Chile and the UK also expressed their interest in introducing the reactor, Zhao noted. Based on current market situations, each Hualong One unit is able to create an output of over 200 billion yuan and create more than 150,000 jobs in China during its designed life. Besides, each exported unit will also generate revenue of nearly 20 billion yuan in the mechanical and material industries Hualong One is a signboard of China's equipment manufacturing, just like high- speed trains, said Xu Ligen, chairman of board of the Fujian Fuqing Nuclear Power Co., Ltd. The most central part of a nuclear power plant is the reactor core in which a minor fault could trigger gigantic problems. \"Hualong One is the world's most advanced third-generation nuclear technology, and safety is its major highlight,\" Zhao told People's Daily. \"We placed three super large tanks above the reactor core, each holding a thousand tonnes of water. Once the active system fails, the water will go down automatically and cool down the reactor,\" Zhao said. The combination of passive and active safety system has largely lowered the risk of meltdown and release of radioactive materials, he added. Besides, the nuclear power plant is covered by a two-layer concrete \"shell\" with a total thickness of over 3 meters. The shell can not only lock radioactive materials inside, but also resist the impacts from large aircraft and earthquakes of 9 magnitude.", "url": "https://newsghana.com.gh/chinas-self-developed-third-gen-nuclear-reactor-put-into-commercial-operation/"}, {"title": "Fuqing Nuclear Power Unit 5 Runs at Full Power to Generate Electricity", "date": "2021-03-02", "content": "On March 1, the world's first reactor of Hualong One-Fujian Fuqing Nuclear Power Unit 5, \"firepowered\", ran at full power and generated more than 27 million kWh on the same day.

The country has brought its first Hualong One-a third- generation pressurized water reactor-online at the Fuqing plant in Fujian province, with its developers calling it a \"strategic tool for the government to promote nuclear power technologies abroad.\" China is making nuclear power the foundation of its power generation sector, building more new nuclear plants than any other country while also making a concerted effort to export its own reactor technology. The World Nuclear Association in September of this year reported China has 18 reactors under construction-representing more than 17 GW of generation capacity-adding to the 51 reactors already in service. Nuclear power has increased emphasis in China as the country tries to improve its emissions profile. China is the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide, owing to its longtime reliance on coal-fired power, and accounts for as much as 30% of worldwide emissions of CO2 -more than double that of the U.S, the world's second-ranking emitter. Chinese officials have made development of nuclear technology, and its export, one of 16 major national science and technology projects, according to the WNA. The initiative to expand nuclear power is led by China National Nuclear Corp. and China General Nuclear Power Group, along with State Power Investment Corp., via that group's State Nuclear Power Technology Corp. A key to China's ambitions is deployment of the world's first pilot project to use the country's indigenous third-generation nuclear power technology, Hualong One, also known as the HPR1000. The Hualong One, in use since January of this year at Unit 5 of the Fuqing plant in Fujian province-with a second HPR1000 set to come online at Fuqing's Unit 6 by year-end-utilizes 177 fuel assemblies as reactor cores to reduce its core power density, while its design also is improving the level of reactor safety, according to CNNC, which said the installed generation capacity of each Hualong One unit can reach nearly 1,200 MWe. Unit 5 includes three ZH-65-type steam generators, each more than 21 meters in length and weighing 365 metric tons. The generators were independently designed by the China Nuclear Power Institute and manufactured by Dongfang Electric Corp. CNNC said operation of a Hualong One reactor makes China the fourth country to bring indigenous Generation III nuclear power technology to market, following the U.S., France, and Russia. Yu Peignen, the deputy party secretary of CNNC and general manager of Dongfang Electric, a primary contractor in the construction of the new Fuqing units, has said of the project: \"After some 30 years of learning and innovation, China has mastered the independent design and manufacturing of third- generation nuclear power facilities, and has shifted from being a novice to a pioneer in the nuclear sector worldwide. The third-generation Hualong One reactor, being a star export, will also lead to more equipment manufacturers going abroad.\" Yu said a key factor in the design of Hualong One is that it can be built on a mass scale. Xing Ji, chief designer of Hualong One at CNNC, has said the reactor's technologically advanced design will help forge a path for globalization of China's nuclear power equipment industry. Xing noted that CNNC technology is now in use in at least seven countries, and the agency is working with more than 40 countries on projects that would include CNNC equipment. Potential for Mass Production: Nuclear power experts have watched the Fuqing project with interest because of its reactor design, and its potential to show how reactors can be built more efficiently. Construction often moved ahead of the expected timeline; for example, the pumps at Fuqing were transported to the site nearly three months earlier than scheduled. Internal structural construction of reactor buildings in Unit 5 was completed in May 2017, just two years after construction began. \"What's especially interesting to me about the HPR1000 is that, from the early days of the design, there's been a focus on making it suitable for mass construction,\" said Leslie Dewan, CEO of RadiantNano, a nuclear startup developing next-generation radiation detectors with applications in national security, clean energy production, and medical diagnostics. Dewan, former CEO of a Transatomic Power, a company known for designing safer nuclear reactors that leave behind less waste than conventional designs, told POWER, \"This is very different from the one-off reactors being built within the United States and Western Europe and, coupled with their growing number of international collaborations, shows that China is now exceptionally well- positioned to export these reactors worldwide.\" The Fuqing nuclear project is jointly owned by CNNC subsidiary China Nuclear Power Co., which has a 51% stake. Huadian Fuxin Energy Co. has a 39% interest, and Fujian Investment and Development Group holds a 10% stake, according to CNNC. The company has touted the HPR1000 as \"a third-generation nuclear technology to which China has exclusive intellectual property rights. It's independently innovated and developed with advanced million-kilowatt PWR pressurized water reactor nuclear power technology with global cutting-edge safety standards, seasoned by lessons learned from the Fukushima nuclear accident.\" Wang Shoujun, a former executive with CNNC and now president of the China Nuclear Society, said even before Fuqing Unit 5 came online that \"The Hualong One reactor has passed all safety requirements and preliminary safety reviews and China should give priority to the country's third-generation nuclear technology in future nuclear power projects. The pace of nuclear power projects in recent years is lagging and as the expanding economy in China is pointing to a growing demand for energy ... nuclear power is not an option but a must-have in the future.\" CNNC said the \"HPR1000 has driven the transformation and upgrading of China's high-end equipment industrial clusters. It has played a principal role in accelerating China's nuclear power 'going global' strategy and promoting international production cooperation. Nuclear technology is of great strategic significance in strengthening China's nuclear industry.\" Dewan said China's operation of its nuclear industry provides a case study for other countries, including the U.S., on how to lead when it comes to nuclear power technology. \"From my American perspective, it drives home the need for the U.S. to streamline our procedures for exporting nuclear technology,\" she said. \"We need to maintain our competitiveness in the global nuclear marketplace, while still maintaining strict standards for nuclear security and nonproliferation.\" Result of a Reorganization: The HPR1000 technology was not always planned for Fuqing. CNNC officials have said the company had expected to use the ACP1000 design for Units 5 and 6, but after a reorganization of China's nuclear industry-prompted in part by the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan, and a pause in China's nuclear power program-the ACP1000 technology was incorporated into the new HPR1000. China's State Council gave final approval for construction of Fuqing Units 5 and 6 in April 2015; construction of Unit 5 began the following month. CNNC said the reactor \"innovatively uses a combination of 'active and passive' safety systems and a double-shell containment, which meets the latest international nuclear safety requirements,\" put in place by the International Atomic Energy Agency after the Fukushima incident. The Fuqing plant is being developed in phases. The first phase includes CNP-1000 PWR units with a capacity of 1 GW each; those four units were commissioned between 2014 and 2017. The second phase, Units 5 and 6, features the HPR1000 units, also with 1-GW capacity. Unit 5 entered commercial operation on Jan. 30 of this year, just more than five-and-a-half years after construction began. The reactor was connected to the power grid on Nov. 27, 2020, after achieving first criticality on Oct. 21 of last year. CNNC in a statement at the time of grid connection said, \"It was confirmed on site that all technical indicators of the unit met the design requirements and that the unit was in good condition. This laid a solid foundation for the subsequent commercial operation of the unit and for the top performance in the world's first third-generation nuclear power reactor.\" Two more HPR1000 units are under construction at the Fangchenggang nuclear plant in southern China, near the border with Vietnam. Unit 3 at Fangchenggang could begin operating as soon as next year, according to CNNC. Fangchenggang is considered a reference plant for a project in Bradwell, UK, that also would use the HPR1000. The Bradwell site previously was home to a nuclear power plant that entered decommissioning in 2002, but is being considered as part of the UK's nuclear power redevelopment program. CNNC is also building two Hualong One units at the Zhangzhou plant in Fujian province, along with two units at Taipingling in Guangdong province. The Hualong One has a design life of 60 years. In addition to the units being built at other China nuclear power plant sites, the technology is being used for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi nuclear plant in Pakistan, part of a $9 billion deal between CNNC and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission that was signed in 2013. Construction of Unit 2 at Karachi began in 2015; the reactor was connected to the power grid in March of this year, a few weeks after Unit 5 at Fuqing entered commercial operation. Construction of Unit 3 at Karachi began in 2016, and that reactor is expected to come online in 2022. The Karachi reactors mark the first export of the HPR1000 technology from China.", "url": "https://www.powermag.com/nuclear-power-foundation-of-chinas-future-generation/"}]}]
