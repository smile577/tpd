The discovery of Pluto-2,500 kilometers wide and fully a billion kilometers beyond Neptune-was made by Clyde Tombaugh, a plucky, twenty-four-year-old American astronomer working at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona when he made the landmark find. News of the long-anticipated discovery of \"Planet X\" rocketed around the world in the spring of 1930, making Tombaugh instantly famous, and garnering a high- profile scientific achievement for what was by then routinely called the \"the American Century.\" Diminutive Pluto, lying beyond both the rocky inner planet and outer gas giant planet zones of our solar system, was for many years an apparent misfit among the planets. Even after its large satellite, Charon, was discovered in 1978, Pluto's classification and scientific value seemed problematic. Today, in 2005, that is no longer the case. The ninth planet is the biggest, the brightest, and the first-discovered member of the solar system's third major architectural zone-the distant and icy Kuiper Belt. Not even Tombaugh and his mentors could have forecast how fascinating their new planet would turn out to be. For eventually, when the technology of astronomy made the detailed investigations of bodies as far away and faint as Pluto-Charon possible, this distant planet-satellite pair turned out to be full of enticing surprises. The ninth planet was revealed to be the first known world with a satellite so large it could be called a double planet, a world with complex seasons and a chaotic orbit, and the only planet with an atmosphere that freezes out and then is reborn every orbit. Pluto, replete with polar caps and fresh snows of not one, but three exotic surface ices-methane, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide-is an exotic wonderland on the ragged edge of the solar system's vast outer wilderness. Even beyond its own fascinating and scientifically titillating attributes, few in 1930 could have imagined that the discovery of Pluto signaled not just a new planet, but-more importantly-the opening salvo of what would become thousands of discoveries of large, icy bodies on a frontier beyond Neptune. Indeed, with the discovery of the vast population of bodies orbiting beyond Neptune in the early 1990s, Pluto's cohort, and thus its context became clear: The ninth planet is the biggest, the brightest, and the first-discovered member of the solar system's third major architectural zone-the distant and icy Kuiper Belt. The discovery of the Kuiper Belt has fueled a revolution in our understanding of the origin, architecture, and richness of the deep outer solar system. Together, Pluto-Charon and the Kuiper Belt constitute an exciting frontier for scientific exploration, rich with possibilities for illuminating the origin of the planets, the formation of planetary satellites and double planet pairs, the interior properties and surface evolution of icy worlds, and the physics of tenuous atmospheres. In fact, so valuable are the Pluto-Charon system and its Kuiper Belt companions, that their exploration was ranked as the highest priority new mission to launch in this decade by the National Academy of Sciences in its Planetary Decadal Survey report to NASA. In the 75 years since Pluto was discovered, the United States has become the leading nation on Earth in both astronomy and space exploration. Making a history for itself that will outlast even this new millennium, the United States has sent the first spacecraft to all of the worlds of our solar system from Mercury to Neptune, and placed teams of human explorers on the Moon six times. Today the US has robotic explorers orbiting Mars and Saturn, roving the surface of Mars, and on their way to comets, the planet Mercury, and even the boundary with interstellar space. Later in the 21st Century, America aspires to put human explorers on the deserts of Mars and on other worlds. When the discovery of planet Pluto was announced in March of 1930, no one could have rightfully imagined this would all come to pass within the lifetime of Americans already living in that year. So too, no one might have imagined-in those days when Lindbergh's crossing of the Atlantic was still a recent technological feat-that Pluto would, within the span of a single human lifetime, be visited by a craft from Earth. At the time of its discovery, no one might have imagined that Pluto would, within the span of a single human lifetime, be visited by a craft from Earth. Yet the scientific wonderland of Pluto, its giant moon Charon, and the Kuiper Belt is the destination for NASA's New Horizons mission, which plans to launch in early 2006. If all goes as planned, New Horizons will cross the entire span of the solar system in record time and conduct flyby reconnaissance studies of the Pluto- Charon system in 2015 and then one or more Kuiper Belt objects before 2020. In accomplishing this historic feat, America will complete the reconnaissance of all the known planets, and provide a new and vivid demonstration of the historic kinds of space exploration that only it has the technical prowess to achieve.

The New Horizons mission will use a plutonium-powered radioisotopethermoelectric generator for power in deep space, where sunlight isn't intenseenough to run the spacecraft. It's like the generators that flew in the Cassini probe now at Saturn. In fact, it'sCassini's spare. \"RTGs have a proven track record and safety record,\"Kurt Lindstrom, NASA's executive for the mission, said in a press conferencetoday at Kennedy Space Center. Several safety reviews and opportunities for public comment remain before thelaunch, now planned for January 2006. The agency has released a draft environmental impact statement. The public cancomment on the statement and learn about the mission at the hearings at theFlorida Solar Energy Center in Cocoa, at Brevard Community College, today at 6p.m. and Wednesday at 1 p.m. \"We will not launch this mission unless it is safe to fly,\" Lindstrom said. Ultimately, the mission must receive presidential approval. Pluto is the last planet humans have not studied with a spacecraft. This probewill not only study Pluto and its moon, Charon, as itflies by, but will continue on to the mysterious ring of icy objects known asthe Kuiper Belt. New Horizons will get there sooner, with a chance to see more of the Kuiper Belt, if it launches in the early part of its Jan.11-Feb. 14, 2006, launch window and can take advantage of a gravity assist fromJupiter. Security problems at the Los Alamos National Laboratory halted production ofplutonium, threatening the mission. But project scientist Hal Weaver, at JohnsHopkins' Applied Physics Laboratory, said the mission will get enough fuel toreach at least one Kuiper Belt object, even if itlaunches in a 2007 backup window. Meeting the schedule has been challenging, said Orlando Figueroa, a deputyassociate administrator in NASA's science directorate, but Lindstrom said theyhad a good chance of making the first window. New Horizons will launch on a Lockheed Martin Atlas 5 rocket from CapeCanaveral Air Force Station. According to the draft environmental impact statement, individuals have lessthan a one in a million chance of getting cancer from a catastrophic accident. There's a 93.8 percent chance of a successful launch, the statement says; a 5.8percent chance of an accident with no release of radiological material; and 0.4percent chance of a mishap with a radiological release. Weaver said he's not a risk expert, but he's familiar with the study. \"I personally feel very comfortable that I'm going to be safe,\" he said. \"I'mgoing to be there with my family at the launch site to watch New Horizons gooff. And we live in a world of risks. I'm more concerned about teaching my16-year-old how to drive and being in the car with him, a lot more concernedabout that than the risks associated with the New Horizons launch.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/910-nasa-seeks-public-views-nuclear-powered-pluto-mission.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Pluto Probe Arrives at Spaceport", "date": "2005-09-26", "content": "A spacecraft bound for Pluto has arrived at NASA's Florida spaceport, bringing it one step closer in its journey toward the distant world. NASA's New Horizons space probe arrived at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Saturday and was promptly us hered into a clean room, NASA officials said Monday. The 1,000-pound spacecraft is slated ride atop a Lockheed Martin Atlas 5 rocket on Jan. 11, 2006 and begin a 10-year journey to Pluto and its moon Charon. New Horizonsis the first of NASA's medium-class missions to fly under the space agency's New Frontiers program. The probe carries a suite of seven science instruments to study Pluto and Charon during its fly by past the planet-moon pair. Researchers hope New Horizons will not map the surface composition of Pluto and Charon, but also record their temperatures, geology and land form history, and study Pluto's atmosphere. NASA officials said that after the flyby, still more than a decade away, New Horizons could also visit other rocky objects beyond Pluto's orbit during an extended mission. But first,the spacecraft has months of tests and preparations that must be completed before launching from Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Engineers are gearing up for a series of tests and readiness checks, including a fullend-to-end test to verify its compatibility with NASA's Deep Space Network that will track the mission, now scheduled for October. In November, the spacecraft's vital hydrazine propellant will be loaded aboard andthe probe will be tested for its spin-balance, NASA officials said. The probe'sAtlas 5 booster will also be stacked by then for a launch countdown rehearsal,they added. If all goeswell, New Horizons will be integrated into its launch vehicle in December. Whilemission managers are currently targeting a two-hour window that begins at 2:07p.m. EST to loft New Horizons, the flight has a wide, month-long launch window that closes on Feb. 14, 2006.

The Atlas 5 is being assembled inside the 30-story Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral's Complex 41 in advance of the targeted January 11 liftoff that will send the five-ton New Horizons probe on its decade-long cosmic cruise to encounter the unexplored planet Pluto. Although the center of Wilma remained well south of the Cape, the large storm delivered heavy rain and hurricane-force winds to the Space Coast on October 24 as it sliced across Florida. A third of the 41-by-275-foot reinforced fabric \"MegaDoor\" on the assembly building's opening that faces the launch pad tore in the storm, causing some debris to fall inside the facility. The Atlas 5's bronze first stage and Centaur upper stage were erected atop a mobile launch platform, and the first of five strap-on solid rocket boosters was attached to the first stage when Wilma blew through. Atlas 5 rockets are put together within the VIF, then moved to the pad in the final 12 hours of the countdown. Post-storm inspections revealed a ding on the solid motor casing, prompting officials to order the booster's removal and replacement. The motor could have been safe to fly, engineers believed, but officials ruled that exchanging it would be quicker than the time required to analyze the damage and re-certify the booster. The launch campaign resumed this week following the Wilma cleanup and vehicle assessments. A second booster was added to the Atlas 5 on Tuesday, and the remaining three boosters earmarked for the mission will be installed through next week. The damaged motor was detached Wednesday. Its replacement is expected to arrive in early December. The slender white boosters are 67 feet long. They are ignited at liftoff to provide a powerful kick in combination with the rocket's RD-180 kerosene- fueled main engine. This launch will mark the first time an Atlas 5 has flown with five strap-on boosters; earlier flights have featured pairs, and one mission used three. Exactly what caused the damage or even what punctured the MegaDoor remains unclear, officials say, since the event wasn't witnessed. A re-planning of the pre-launch schedule is being conducted to recover from the unanticipated booster replacement. The original plans allowed time off during the Thanksgiving and year-end holiday seasons. But New Horizons must depart Earth within a narrow launch window dictated by alignment of the planets, making it appear inevitable that some holiday time will have to be spent readying for the launch. The overall launch opportunity extends from January 11 to February 14. However, the first 23 days of the window are most desirable because a launch during that period enables the spacecraft to swing past Jupiter for a gravity sling-shot that speeds the travel to Pluto. The final 12 days of the window would miss Jupiter, significantly delaying the Pluto arrival. Lockheed Martin is looking at a temporary repair to the torn MegaDoor, while hoping tropical weather systems stay clear of the Cape during the waning month of hurricane season. A long-term fix to the door is being studied.

This first mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt--a distant district of ancient, icy, rocky objects on the solar system's outer banks--is assured to transmit back to Earth numbers of revelations. Now being groomed for sendoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, New Horizons has a 35-day launch window that opens January 11, 2006. The probe would start a decade of cruising to reach the Pluto system, arriving on the scene as early as summer 2015. Getting a spacecraft en route to Pluto has not been easy. The march to that remote world has been dogged by budget battles, funding slashes, start-and-stop mission planning and hardware building. But now the Pluto-bound craft is assembled, tested, and primed for an extraordinary expedition to the edge of the solar system. Scientific surprises Along with the spacecraft, also undergoing final prep is the New Horizons booster: A Lockheed Martin Atlas 5 first stage with five strap-on solid rocket boosters, a powerful Centaur second stage, topped by a STAR 48B solid propellant-fueled third stage. The New Horizons spacecraft is roughly 8 feet across and weighs roughly 1,025 pounds --about half a ton--when loaded with fuel. The Department of Energy will supply the interplanetary probe with its power source, a single radioisotope thermoelectric generator. Even before New Horizons rockets off Earth, Pluto has done its best to keep scientists guessing about the far-flung planet and Charon, a companion moon. Last month, NASA announced that the Hubble Space Telescope had observed that Pluto may have not one, but three moons. New moons Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys spotted the two candidate moons earlier in the year. The applicants for new moon-status are roughly 5,000 times fainter than the planet they orbit. \"I'm calling the discovery of the two new satellites the first scientific result of New Horizons,\" said Alan Stern, principal investigator for the mission here at the Department of Space Studies of the Southwest Research Institute. The Hubble observations were done in support of the mission, he told SPACE.com. Ground telescopes have long tried to scan for new moons around Pluto, Stern said. It took all of two eight-minute integration sessions for the space-based telescope to snag the objects. Stern said that Hubble will be utilized again in February to scan for additional moons around Pluto. \"One question that is on the table is just how many more little satellites are lurking there,\" he added. Rings around Pluto? And there could be yet another surprise awaiting New Horizons. Calculations done by Stern and fellow researchers show that small moons around Pluto--having low escape speeds--when hit by objects not only are craters formed, but debris from the moons would be tossed off into space. \"We're predicting that Pluto might have a ring system,\" Stern said. \"We're going to plan observations with New Horizons to look for those.\" Given new moons, a possible ring system--Pluto and its environs are ripe for up-close surveillance, Stern said. \"In my wildest dreams...I hoped to get four objects on this mission ... Pluto, Charon, and one or more Kuiper Belt Objects. Now I get four, right at Pluto.\" New Horizons sports a flexible set of instruments, set on discovery mode. That equipment will also be on the lookout for hazards. \"We're also going to be using Hubble and other tools here on Earth for the next 10 years...to get a head's up about things long before we get there,\" Stern said. Suite of seven instruments The cost of the mission, including the launch vehicle and operations through the Pluto-Charon encounter, will be roughly $650 million. Assuming liftoff during the primary launch window in January, the first 13 months include spacecraft and instrument checkouts, instrument calibrations, trajectory correction maneuvers. Spacecraft operators will also be rehearsing an encounter with Jupiter, slated to occur between February 25 and March 2, 2007. Once en route, data sent from New Horizons will be received on Earth through NASA's Deep Space Network, dispatched onward to the spacecraft's Mission Operations Center at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. APL manages the mission for NASA and built the New Horizons spacecraft. A radio signal moving at the speed of light takes about four hours to reach Pluto from Earth. New Horizon carries a suite of seven scientific instruments: 1. Alice is an ultraviolet spectrometer used for measuring gas composition. 2. Ralph combines an infrared spectrometer for mapping surface composition with a color optical imager for mapping surface structure and composition. 3. REX is a radio experiment for measuring atmospheric composition and temperature. 4. LORRI is an optical telescope that provides the highest resolution imaging of the surface 5. PEPSSI is a plasma-sensing instrument for measuring particles escaping from Pluto's atmosphere. 6. SWAP is a plasma-sensing instrument for measuring the properties of the solar wind at Pluto, Pluto's atmospheric escape rate, and for searching for a magnetosphere around Pluto. The \"solar wind\" is a stream of charged particles streaming away from the Sun at high speed. 7. SDC, an instrument used to measure dust impacts at the New Horizons spacecraft during its entire trajectory, was built by students at the University of Colorado in Boulder. New Horizons is outfitted with a compact nuclear power system. The hardware converts the heat generated from the natural decay of radioactive fuel into electricity. The RTG consists of two major elements: a heat source that contains plutonium dioxide in the form of ceramic pellets and a set of solid- state thermocouples that convert the plutonium's heat energy to electricity. Like any NASA mission designed to use an RTG, New Horizons has undergone extensive, multi-agency safety and risk reviews throughout its development. Final approval to launch, however, will come from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. SwRI's Stern said that the New Horizon RTG has been tested. \"We put it on the spacecraft to make sure that everything is mounted correctly. We turned on the spacecraft...ran all the instruments...for a number of hours to make sure that there were no surprises ahead,\" he explained. One slight glitch in readying the booster for New Horizons was brought about by Mother Nature's fury. Winds whipped up by a hurricane that struck Florida caused a door on the rocket's garage-like vertical hangar to bend inward. That section of door contacted the only solid rocket motor attached to the booster at the time. Stern said that the \"safest, most conservative\" decision was made not to re- qualify for flight that motor. Rather, a spare was brought in to replace the unit. \"They switched it out. Now all the other solid rocket boosters are there ... and hurricane season is over!\" Getting the goods For Stern, New Horizons and its mission have been a long time coming. \"It's awe inspiring, no question. The United States is going to the Kuiper Belt. We are launching to the edge of the solar system. It's like something out of a story book,\" Stern said. But if there is a moral to this space story book it's that persistence is a virtue, Stern explained. It look a lot of perseverance on the part of the scientific community to come back time and time again when Pluto missions would fall apart at the seams, he added. Now with launch less than 50 days away, the mission of New Horizons and its lengthy flight toward Pluto rapidly approaches. \"We don't succeed unless we get the goods at Pluto,\" Stern admitted. \"Simply launching is not a mission success ... but it is one hell of a major milestone.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/1800-horizons-voyage-edge-solar-system.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's New Horizons Pluto Probe Ready for Launch", "date": "2006-01-15", "content": "NASA'sfirst spacecraft aimed at the edge of our solar system is ready for its morethan nine-year trek to the planet Pluto and beyond, mission managers saidSunday. Thespacecraft, dubbed NewHorizons, is set to launch spaceward atop a Lockheed Martin-built Atlas 5rocket on Jan. 17, beginning a spaceflight that will stretch more than nineyears to reach a planet 3.06 billion miles fromEarth. \"I like tocall this mission the Everest of planetary exploration,\" said New Horizonsprincipal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute ,Sunday during a prelaunch press briefing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in CapeCanaveral, Florida. \"It's really fantastic.\" NewHorizons is set to launch Tuesday from Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air ForceStation during a nearly two-hour window that opens at 1:24 p.m. EST .The McLean, Virginia-based firm International Launch Services is overseeing thespace shot. The New Horizons spacecraft and its booster are set to roll out tothe launch pad on Monday. \"It's thefastest spacecraft ever launched,\" Colleen Hartman, NASA's deputy associateadministrator for science mission directorate, said of New Horizons during thebriefing. \"It will get to the Moon in nine hours...it will get to Jupiter in oneyear and nine months.\" It tookNASA's Apollo astronauts three days to reach the Moon in the 1960s and 1970s aboardtheir spacecraft, while the Cassini probe took four years to swing pastJupiter, Hartman added. But NewHorizons has more on its plate than merely speeding through the solar system. Thespacecraft is the first to reach out toward Pluto, its moon Charon and two otherobjects thought to be additional satellites. After flying past theplanetary system at more than 31,000 miles an hour \\- though that phase of the $700 million spaceflight will depend onwhether the New Horizons mission is extended, mission scientists said. \"Pluto isjust the brightest of the many objects in the Kuiper Belt,\" Stern said. \"It's afossil relic of the formation of our solar system.\" With itstiny size and eccentric orbit, Pluto was once thought to be a planetary misfitin our solar system. But the discovery of several other objects beyond Pluto'sorbit - including a potential10th planet \\- has forced a review of that belief, researcherssaid. \"We know of17 objects that could be called planets, most of which are ice dwarfs,\" Sternsaid, adding that the number is based on objects found large enough for theirgravity to coalesce surrounding material into spherical shapes. \"So Pluto istypical of what is probably the most populous type of planet in our solarsystem. It probably mimics other Kuiper Belt objects.\" Researchershope New Horizons will shed light on Pluto's ethereal atmosphere, which theplanet appears to shed almost like a comet as it moves through space. Duringthe probe's flyby, it is also expected to build detailed maps of Pluto'ssurface, photograph Charon and hopefully photograph the other two moons -currently dubbed P1 and P2 - discovered last fall in Hubble Space Telescope images. \"We'llbasically be able to map the entire planet ,\" Dale Cruikshank, a New Horizonsscience team co-investigator from NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffet Field,California, told reporters. The NewHorizons spacecraft is about the size of a piano and weighs about 1,054 pounds. It carries seven primary instruments, including several cameras,plasma detectors and other tools to study Pluto. NewHorizons is also NASA's first planetary probe to carry a student-built instrument.Built by engineering students at the University of Colorado, the spacecraft'sStudent Dust Counter designed to detect tiny dust particles throughout thenine-year trek to Pluto, researchers said. NASAofficials said Pluto is the only planet ever discovered in the 20th century, as well as by a U.S. citizen, marking the firstof many bodies later found the Kuiper Belt. AstronomerClyde Tombaugh discovered the distant world in 1930 using a telescope at theLowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. While the astronomer died in 1997, Tombaugh'sfamily - his wife Patsy and two grown children - will be on hand for theupcoming launch, mission researchers said. \"We thankthem for being here with us,\" Stern said. Whileresearchers will have to wait more than nine years after New Horizons' launchto get their first close look at Pluto, they have some good ideas of what theymight see. Images of Neptune'smoon Triton- from NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft - and Saturn's satellite Enceladus- taken by the Cassiniprobe - have hinted at some geological activity that New Horizons couldfind at Pluto, according to Cruikshank. \"There maybe geysers, there may be jets of material,\" Cruikshank said. \"There may even beevidence of cracking on the surface.\" Stern hassaid it may even be possible that Pluto sports its own ring system made up ofmaterial cast off from previous impacts. \"We have abody of information as to what we'll find in the outer solar system,\"Cruikshank said. \"But we're certainly prepared to be surprised.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/1952-nasa-horizons-pluto-probe-ready-launch.html"}, {"title": "New Horizons on Track for Jupiter", "date": "2006-02-03", "content": "Aspacecraft headed for the Solar System's edge has aimed itself at the planetJupiter in a long-distance slingshot on toward Pluto.

At 1.5 billion kilometers or 935 million miles (10.06 astronomical units) distant, that's a mission's worth of space for most spacecraft. But for New Horizons, it's just another interplanetary point on its voyage to the outer reaches of our solar system. As a testament to New Horizons' speed, the spacecraft set a record for the fastest transit to Saturn by any spacecraft, making the trip in two years and four months. Voyager 1, the previous record holder, made the journey in approximately three years and two months. Still aiming for its arrival at the Pluto/Charon system in July of 2015, New Horizons' mission managers tell us the spacecraft is healthy, and in electronic hibernation. After a productive two-week series of system checks, maintenance activities, and software and command uploads, New Horizons is humming through the outer solar system at 65,740 kilometers per hour (40,850 mph). The team expects to keep the spacecraft in hibernation until Sept. 2. Although the first 13 months of the mission kept the New Horizons team pretty busy, through its encounter with and gravity assist from Jupiter in February 2007, the next few years will probably be fairly quiet for the mission's scientists and engineers. In a previous interview, Alan Stern, New Horizons' Principle Investigator told Universe Today, \"The middle years will be long and probably, and hopefully, pretty boring. But it will include yearly spacecraft and instrument checkouts, trajectory corrections, instrument calibrations and rehearsals for the main mission.\" During the last three years of the interplanetary cruise mission, Stern said teams will be writing, testing and uploading the highly detailed command script for the Pluto/Charon encounter. The mission begins in earnest approximately a year before the spacecraft arrives at Pluto, as it begins to photograph the region.

Pluto was once thought to be as big as the Earth. It was regarded as a full- fledged planet for three-quarters of a century, only to be demoted to a new category, \"dwarf planet,\" in 2006. Pluto was not known to have any moons until 1978, and now scientists have found four satellites around the frigid, distant body - more than circle Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury combined. In short, scientists' understanding of Pluto, while improving, has always been fuzzy. And the picture likely won't really begin coming clear until NASA's New Horizons spacecraft makes the first-ever close flyby of the dwarf planet in July 2015. \"This is a whole new kind of planet,\" said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. \"It's going to blow our doors off.\" New annotated image showing Pluto and moons, including the newly discovered P4, released July 20, 2011. Finding Planet X? Pluto was discovered by American Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, as part of a search for the mythical \"Planet X\" that was thought to be perturbing the orbit of Uranus. Initial estimates of Pluto's size were off by a wide margin. \"It was presumed to be the size of Earth, and it was then reported as such,\" said Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium. The inaccuracy is understandable in many ways, because Pluto was difficult to detect in the early days, let alone study. The dwarf planet orbits 3.65 billion miles from the sun on average, about 39 times farther away than Earth does. Over the years, estimates of Pluto's mass kept getting revised downward. But astronomers didn't get a good read on the dwarf planet's mass until 1978, when they discovered Pluto has a moon. This moon, named Charon, is more than half Pluto's size. Hubble brings Pluto into view Pluto remained just a faint point of light until the 1990s, when NASA's Hubble Space Telescope imaged its surface for the first time. With these pictures, scientists learned that Pluto's surface is complex, harboring both light and dark areas. \"No one predicted that,\" Tyson told SPACE.com. \"It has some of the highest brightness contrast of any objects in the solar system.\" The 1990s also brought another sea change in astronomers' perception of Pluto: That it wasn't alone out on the edge of the solar system. Researchers began discovering other big, icy, Pluto-like bodies orbiting far from the sun. \"That was the real kicker,\" Tyson said. \"It was clear that Pluto was just part of this whole other kind of family in the solar system.\" This growing realization set the stage for the stripping of Pluto's planethood, but it took the discovery of an even more distant icy object to really get the wheels turning. Pluto's demotion In 2005, a team led by Caltech astronomer Mike Brown discovered Eris, which sits about twice as far from the sun as Pluto does. At the time, Eris was thought to be bigger than Pluto ). Eris' discovery ultimately led astronomers - uncomfortable with the prospect of finding many more planets in the frigid outer reaches of the solar system - to reconsider Pluto's status. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union came up with the following official definition of \"planet\": A body that circles the sun without being some other object's satellite, is large enough to be rounded by its own gravity and has \"cleared its neighborhood\" of most other orbiting bodies. Since Pluto shares orbital space with lots of other objects out in the Kuiper Belt - the ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune - it didn't make the cut. Instead, the IAU rebranded Pluto and Eris as \"dwarf planets.\" Dwarf planets are not considered full-fledged planets, so Pluto was stripped of the status it had held since its discovery in 1930. Eight planets officially remain in the solar system. The decision was controversial, and it remains so to this day. Many scientists, including Stern, believe that the IAU's new definition is arbitrary, flawed and unscientific, and that it was drawn up chiefly to keep the official planets down to a manageable number. While the debate continues over Pluto's status, the dwarf planet has kept getting more and more interesting. An atmosphere, three more moons - and many discoveries to come Studies have found, for example, that Pluto has an atmosphere. This tenuous gas layer, composed chiefly of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, extends about 1,860 miles beyond Pluto's surface - nearly one-quarter of the way to Charon. Further, in 2005, scientists using Hubble discovered that Pluto had two more moons, which they named Nix and Hydra. And just yesterday, Hubble observations detected the tiny fourth moon, which is being called P4 for now. P4 is likely not the last surprise Pluto has in store for astronomers, Stern said. He expects the New Horizons mission to make many discoveries when it reaches Pluto four years from now and shines the first probing light on the distant, dark world. \"No one has ever been to an ice dwarf,\" Stern told SPACE.com. \"It's going to write the textbooks - not even rewrite them, because there's nothing to write at this point.\" And the knowledge gained about Pluto should help scientists learn more about the Kuiper Belt in general, which remains mysterious despite its large population of icy bodies. After it flies by the Pluto system, New Horizons is slated to study one or two other Kuiper Belt objects as well. \"We now know that there are more Kuiper Belt planets than giant planets and terrestrial planets combined,\" Stern said. \"This is the dominant class of planets in our solar system, and we have not yet sent a spacecraft mission to them. So New Horizons is going to teach us a lot about a whole new class of world.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/12388-dwarf-planet-pluto-changing-perceptions.html"}, {"title": "Dwarf Planet Pluto Holds Big Surprises for Speedy NASA Probe", "date": "2011-08-23", "content": "Pluto may be small, but it is proving to be big on surprises. With NASA's New Horizons spacecraft now speeding toward it, our understanding of the dwarf planet should transform even further. \"We've never had a reconnaissance of a dwarf planet such as Pluto before, and every time we've been to a new type of planet, we find nature is much richer than we expected,\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., told SPACE.com. New Horizons, which was sent aloft in 2006, has been billed by NASA as its fastest spacecraft ever launched from Earth, having sped from our planet at about 36,000 mph. The probe should reach Pluto and its moons in July 2015. The first good look at Pluto New Horizons will be the first up-close reconnaissance of Pluto in history. It will mark one of the first times scientists get to study a new type of planet this close since the 1970s, when NASA explored the giant planet Jupiter.. Scientists have already discovered that Pluto apparently changes colors seasonally and has geysers erupting from its surface. As for what might come next, \"we don't know for sure what we'll find out there, which is what is so exciting about the mission,\" Stern said. While Pluto may be small, it has no dearth of moons. In addition to the three moons known since the mid-2000s - Nix, Hydra and its largest, Charon, which is half the size of Pluto - scientists recently discovered a fourth, simply called \"P4\" for now. \"We should expect Pluto to reveal how complex dwarf planet systems can be,\" Stern said. \"We may even find rings around Pluto.\" Binary planet In addition, unlike any world explored to date, Pluto forms a binary planet with Charon. Their gravitational balance point, or barycenter, lies between the two bodies. In comparison, the barycenter of the Earth and moon lies beneath the Earth's surface. Binary planets are thought to be common in the galaxy, as are binary stars, but no spacecraft has yet explored one. New Horizons will be the first mission to a binary object of any type. \"Before space exploration, the thought was that smaller worlds would be less complex than larger ones,\" Stern said. \"But one of the surprises that came with the exploration of planets is that smaller worlds are often extremely complex, sometimes more than bigger worlds.\" Atmosphere of Pluto ... and Charon? New Horizons carries a variety of sensors \"that will let us map the geology and composition and atmosphere and temperature of Pluto, as well as the objects in its system,\" Stern said. Pluto's atmosphere is escaping to space like a comet's, but on a planetary scale - a phenomenon unlike anything else in the solar system. New Horizons may discover that Charon has an atmosphere as well, albeit an extraordinarily thin one. By studying these atmospheres, scientists might learn more about how the one on our planet - the thin skin that protects us from the void of space, enabling life to take root - evolved.

New research has not only concluded such an ocean is likely, but also has highlighted features the spacecraft could identify that could help confirm an ocean's existence. Pluto's outer surface is composed of a thin shell of nitrogen ice, covering a shell of water ice. Planetary scientists Guillaume Robuchon and Francis Nimmo, both of the University of California at Santa Cruz, wanted to find out whether or not an ocean could exist underneath this icy shell, and what visible signs such an ocean might produce on the surface. The pair modeled the thermal evolution of the dwarf planet and studied the behavior of the shell to see how the surface would be affected by the presence of an ocean below. Searching the surface Ironically, the easiest feature to identify would appear if no ocean existed. As spherical bodies spin, their angular momentum tends to push material towards the equator, forming a bulge. If Pluto boasts a liquid layer, the ice would flow, reducing such a protrusion. Thus, the appearance of a \"frozen-in\" primordial bulge, left over from when Pluto spun more rapidly, would signify a lack of ocean. \"If the bulge is present, it will be about 6 miles high, so it should be readily detectable,\" Nimmo said. New Horizons project scientist Hal Weaver agreed on the last point. \"New Horizon imaging will measure the shape of Pluto very accurately.\" Launched in 2006, the NASA mission should reach Pluto in April of 2015. In addition to determining the contours of Pluto, it will also study the temperature, the atmospheric makeup, and the solar wind around the distant planet. The surface features and composition also will be targets. These surface features could provide hints as to what lies beneath. As Pluto cooled over its lifetime, the temperature changes resulted in a change in volume, creating surface stresses. Classifying these features should reveal whether or not they overlie an ocean. Icy water beneath the shell would result in tensional stresses as the ice was stretched, while a solid layer would have meant compressional stresses as the material was squeezed. Such fractures would likely span the globe, rather than being unique to specific areas. This is ideal, since New Horizons will not map the entire surface of Pluto. Because of the complications involved in going into orbit, the craft will only fly past the icy dwarf planet. But imaging will begin around three months before its closest approach. \"New Horizons will map the entire sunlit surface of Pluto,\" Weaver explained, \"but only the hemisphere facing the spacecraft near the time of the flyby will be mapped at the highest resolution.\" The highest resolution will capture 62 meters per pixel when the craft is within 7,750 miles. However, the more distant images still will be approximately ten times more detailed than those captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Ridges and valleys with heights and depths of 260 feet should be distinguishable. Other potential features include geysers similar to those found on Saturn's moon Enceladus and Neptune's moon Triton. Water on an icy planet At an average of forty times the distance from the sun to the Earth, Pluto seems an unlikely candidate for harboring an ocean, even underground. But the heat that might melt the ice would come from inside. The main source of energy likely stems from the rocky interior, where isotopes undergo radioactive decay. Among these elements, the researchers found potassium to be key - enough potassium in Pluto's core would result in melted ice above it. And signs look good - the amount of potassium needed would be about a tenth of that found in meteorites from the early solar system. \"I think there is a good chance that Pluto has enough potassium to maintain an ocean,\" Nimmo said. An important factor that would influence the formation of an ocean is the viscosity of the ice, or how much it resists flowing. A slushier ice shell would suck the heat from the water beneath it, causing the ocean to freeze, while a more solid, high-viscosity shell would not. According to the models, the planet-wide ocean would have an average depth of approximately 100 miles, beneath a crust of ice of the same thickness. The growing habitable zone Scientists regard water as necessary for life as we know it, so focus tends to fall on the habitable zone around stars, the region where temperatures allow for liquid water to exist on a rocky planet. But in our solar system, liquid water is already anticipated to exist outside this region. Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto may each contain a sea beneath their icy surfaces, and Saturn's moon Titan also shows hints of an underground water ocean. According to Nimmo, Pluto is unlikely to contain life because the organic nutrients considered necessary were probably leached away years ago. However, if a subsurface ocean exists on the dwarf planet, then other objects in the Kuiper belt are potentially more habitable than previously suspected. \"They almost certainly have oceans too, since some are about the size of Pluto,\" Nimmo said. Such objects could contain not only liquid water but the necessary ingredients for life that Pluto probably lacks.

The debris instead finds itself caught in orbit around Pluto, where it could pose a serious threat to New Horizons. \"The most likely problem we would encounter is to be hit by something that is large enough to instantly destroy the spacecraft,\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, told SPACE.com. Though cameras on the New Horizons probe will begin observing the Pluto system several months before its closest approach, they won't be able to detect the fast-flying milligram- size particles that could spell instant death if they collide with the vehicle. New moons on the rise Pluto's first known moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, nearly 50 years after the dwarf planet was found. The Hubble Space Telescope discovered the next two of Pluto's moons in 2005, only two and a half months before New Horizons was launched. In July of this year, a fourth moon of Pluto was located, and there are hints that two more might exist. With three of Pluto's four moons having been discovered in the last five years, scientists have a hunch there are likely more still hidden. Due to these new additions, a group of experts recently convened to analyze the hazards New Horizons might face. After determining the threat was real, they discussed how to avoid it. A harder look at the challenge could make a significant difference, scientists say. Continuing to study the system with the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as several ground-based telescopes, could help reveal other hidden moons and their orbits well before New Horizons arrives. Hunting hidden moons But searching doesn't necessarily mean success. \"If there are moons too small, meaning too faint, then we won't find them,\" Stern said. With that in mind, the group also determined the need for a good \"safe haven bailout trajectory,\" or SHBOT - an orbit that New Horizons could shift into that would keep it away from the most likely danger zones. The best route would zip through Charon's orbit, but on the opposite side of the planet from the moon. The large body constantly clears debris from its path, creating a safe route for New Horizons to pass through. This strategy works best if the debris remains in a plane, similar to Saturn's rings. If, however, it orbits Pluto in a cloud, the danger is heightened. If New Horizons encounters dirt and dust from the moons, it could put an abrupt end to the first mission to Pluto. \"There is no wounded here - only dead or alive,\" Stern said.

The New Horizons spacecraft launched Jan. 19, 2006, on a mission to become the first probe to visit the dwarf planet Pluto and its moons. That unprecedented encounter is slated to begin in January 2015, so New Horizons has now entered the home stretch of its nine-year trip, researchers said. \"It's really around the corner,\" said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. \"We're just more and more excited.\" Entering 'late cruise' phase The New Horizons team breaks the spacecraft's flight to Pluto into three three-year segments, Stern said - early cruise, mid cruise and late cruise. \"We are now turning the corner from mid cruise to late cruise,\" Stern told SPACE.com. \"We're really in the final stages.\" Photos of Pluto and Its Moons Late cruise should be a busy time for mission scientists and engineers, as they check out the spacecraft's systems and prepare for the flyby of Pluto and its four known moons. That encounter technically begins in January 2015, Stern said, though closest approach will occur that July, when New Horizons comes within about 6,000 miles of Pluto. During the flyby, New Horizons will study Pluto and its moons with seven different instruments, performing the first in-depth reconnaissance of these frigid, far-flung objects. In fact, researchers have said, the mission will give scientists their first good look at any dwarf planet - a class of bodies suspected to be far more numerous in our solar system than terrestrial and giant planets combined. 1 billion miles to go Pluto is found in the Kuiper Belt, the ring of icy objects beyond Neptune's orbit. As of today, New Horizons has put about 2.14 billion miles on its odometer, with roughly another 1 billion miles left to go before the close encounter. The probe's work won't be done after it flies by the Pluto system in 2015. The mission team wants New Horizons to study one or two other Kuiper Belt objects as well. NASA has billed New Horizons as the fastest spacecraft ever launched from Earth. According to the mission team, the probe is now speeding through space at 34,426 mph relative to the sun. While New Horizons spends most of its cruise time hibernating, it's awake for now. Scientists and engineers are performing various tests on the spacecraft throughout January, Stern said, adding that the spacecraft is in good health. 'An American story' The excitement of the New Horizons team has been tempered with some sadness this month, as the scientists mourn the death of Patsy Tombaugh, the widow of Pluto's discoverer. Pluto was discovered in 1930 by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who died in 1997. Patsy passed away on Jan. 12 at the age of 99. Patsy Tombaugh was very enthusiastic about the New Horizons mission, and the team will miss her a great deal, Stern said. \"She was such a wonderful woman,\" Stern said. \"It was sad to see her pass without getting to see what her husband's planet really looked like.\" But the Tombaughs' two children, Annette and Alden, should get to see what New Horizons discovers. They'll be the mission team's guests of honor when the probe makes its closest approach to Pluto in July 2015, Stern said. On top of its technical and scientific ambitions, New Horizons is also part of \"a very personal story, an American story,\" Stern said. \"I think that just makes it nice.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/14289-nasa-pluto-spacecraft-horizons-anniversary.html"}, {"title": "Petitioners Push for Pluto Probe Postage Stamp", "date": "2012-02-01", "content": "In 1991, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp depicting the now on- again, off-again planet Pluto with the inscription \"Not Yet Explored.\" Now, the team behind NASA's first mission to the last planet wants to correct that record with a stamp of their own. Launched in January 2006, NASA's New Horizons robotic spacecraft is set to flyby Pluto and its moons in 2015. It is now more than two billion miles from Earth - beyond the planet Uranus' orbit - and since December, has been the closest probe to come near the icy dwarf planet. \"We're now in new territory as the closest any spacecraft has ever gotten to Pluto, and getting closer every day by over a million kilometers,\" said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute. Roused from hibernation for several weeks last month for a battery of system and experiment tests, New Horizons is in the \"late cruise\" phase of its journey. Its team at John Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland is preparing the probe for its final stages leading up to the flyby and closest approach to Pluto. Timed accordingly, the mission team launched a petition campaign Wednesday for the U.S. Postal Service to commemorate the New Horizons on a stamp. Stamp on history The online petition is directed at the USPS and its Citizen Stamp Advisory Committee. The latter has been tasked since 1957 with evaluating the merits of all stamp proposals. \"Subjects should be submitted at least three years in advance of the proposed date of issue to allow sufficient time for consideration and for design and production, if the subject is approved,\" the CSAC states on the U.S. Postal Service website. According to the petition, the New Horizons team hopes to collect 100,000 signatures or more by March 13, the 82nd anniversary of the announcement of Pluto's discovery. Photos: Pluto and its moons \"We're asking people to sign the petition, because the post office considers not just the merits of a new stamp proposal, but also whether it is supported by a significant number of people,\" Stern said in the announcement for the petition campaign. \"This is a chance for us all to celebrate what American space exploration can achieve though hard work, technical excellence, the spirit of scientific inquiry, and the uniquely human drive to explore.\" The stamp would commemorate more than New Horizons becoming the first spacecraft to study Pluto. \"The Pluto flyby will represent the first exploration of the Kuiper Belt, the first exploration of a double planet, the first exploration of an ice dwarf planet, and the farthest object ever explored in space,\" the petition reads. Accompanying the petition, the New Horizons team also debuted a concept for the stamp by Southwest Research Institute scientist and artist Dan Durda, whose works have appeared on the mission's website and other venues. Durda's stamp shows New Horizons passing by Pluto with the planet's moon, Charon, in the background. Durda's artwork however, is just for illustration. Citing the demands of stamp design and reproduction requirements, it is USPS policy not to accept unsolicited artwork. To Pluto with postage Whether or not the New Horizons team is successful in getting the USPS to honor their spacecraft's mission, the probe will have delivered a stamp to Pluto. On New Horizons, together with eight other mementos, is one of the 1991 \"Not Yet Explored\" Pluto stamps. \"Pluto may not have been explored when that stamp set came out, but we were going to conquer that,\" Stern told collectSPACE.com in a 2008 interview. \"I wanted to fly it as a sort of 'in your face' thing.\" That stamp was issued as part of a series that honored robotic space exploration of the planets. In the decades since, the USPS has released postage commemorating NASA's Mars Pathfinder and the Pioneer 10 planetary missions, as well as - most recently - the M esseng er mission to Mercury, which was depicted on a stamp last year.

Google to the rescue! I did an image search on \"Jupiter Io\" -- I recognized the moon as Io from the obvious volcanic plume and features on its surface -- and quickly got my answer. Basically, it's a montage of two images, both of which are real but were taken separately. They were taken by NASA's New Horizons probe, which passed Jupiter in 2007. New Horizons is on its way to Pluto, and flew past Jupiter to steal some of its energy and boost the speed of the probe. The shot of Jupiter is actually a composite of three images taken in the infrared, well past what the human eye can see. That big blue spot is actually the Great Red Spot! But the scientists applied a false color to the infrared images for this picture. The different colors more or less show cloud height: high-altitude clouds are blue, and clouds deeper in the Jovian atmosphere are red. Io is actually depicted as more true to what your eye would see -- it's shown in visible light, not infrared. However, that image of the moon was taken nearly a day after the Jupiter pictures were taken! The two pictures were stitched together later. The red spot is an active volcano on Io, and the blue swoosh is the plume of ejecta reaching well above the moon's surface. Update : Apropos of this, and coincidentally, the USGS just released a global map of Io. On Google+, I posted a the Io map highlighting Tvashtar Paterae, the volcanic region erupting in this picture. I'll note that the phase of Jupiter -- almost half full or so -- isn't real, though. The infrared images of the planet were taken many minutes apart, and Jupiter rotates so quickly that they would've been blurred, smeared, if simply shown as they were taken. To compensate, the person putting the image together mathematically projected the pictures onto a sphere seen obliquely like this. In reality, the space probe was nearly directly above Jupiter's lit side when it took those images. Weird! Anyway, apparently this picture was posted on reddit linking to an anonymous image hosting site that didn't have much by the way of explanation, and got out into the wild of the internet. People loved it -- I mean, come on, it's an awesome shot -- but weren't sure if it was even real, or where it came from. I'll note that way down in the comments on that post the true nature of the picture is revealed, but not before the picture got spread far and wide. That happens on the 'net, and I'm just glad I got people asking me about it. One of the big points of putting together pictures like this for the public is to pique their curiosity! And I'm happy to oblige that desire to learn. Think about it: this picture isn't a fake, it's real, more or less, and it's from a small spacecraft on its way to Pluto, and then out of the solar system forever. And as usual, reality is way, way cooler than fakery.

On Wednesday, researchers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope announced the detection of P5, a tiny moon measuring just 6 to 15 miles across. P5 brings Pluto's known satellite tally to five, and it comes just a year after Hubble spotted moon number four, the similarly diminutive P4. These two recent discoveries show that the Pluto system is more crowded than scientists had thought. So NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, which is due to fly by the dwarf planet in 2015, may have to watch its step. \"We're finding more and more, so our concern about hazards is going up,\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., told SPACE.com. The Moons of Pluto Revealed The concern is not necessarily that New Horizons, which launched in 2006, will slam into a Pluto moon that has thus far eluded detection. The probe is traveling so fast that a particle the size of a BB could destroy it, so researchers are worried about the broad debris field that Pluto's moons may have spawned. \"Every new satellite is a debris producer,\" Stern said. When these moons suffer impacts, he explained, \"the ejecta goes into orbit around Pluto, and so the more satellites, the more concern we have.\" Stern and his colleagues are inventorying the Pluto system with Hubble to get a better handle on the risks New Horizons faces, and to help design the safest possible trajectory for the spacecraft. Adjustments to the probe's path could even be made late in the game, as New Horizons nears the dwarf planet, Stern said. \"We have a backup trajectory called SHBOT, safe haven bail-out trajectory,\" he said. \"We can fire our engines very late if we see something on approach of the Pluto system using our own cameras. We won't go as close to Pluto in that case. In terms of macroscopic objects, we can go down to objects just a few kilometers wide. Also, we can look for rings and individual particles that are small.\" While P5 is keeping New Horizons scientists on their toes, the newfound satellite is further whetting their appetite for what the spacecraft will discover three years from now. \"It's another reminder of how little is known\" about the Pluto system, Stern said. \"Every time we look harder, we find new stuff: An atmosphere, polar caps, more and more moons, a big albedo. When New Horizons gets there, I think it's going to knock our socks off. It's going to be whole new world.\" Natalie Wolchover, staff writer at SPACE.com sister site Life's Little Mysteries, contributed to this story.

Scientists are now designing alternate courses for the Pluto-bound New Horizons spacecraft that would steer it out of harm's way, while at the same time helping the probe explore its mysterious targets. \"We want people to understand just how interesting and how nail-biting New Horizons' mission might be,\" study lead author Alan Stern, principal investigator of the New Horizons mission at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. \"This is part of the excitement of first-time exploration, of going to a new frontier.\" New Horizons is the first probe ever designed to investigate worlds in the Kuiper Beltof icy bodies. After nearly seven years, the spacecraft is now more than 24 times farther away from the sun than Earth is, placing it past the orbit of Uranus. Next stop: Pluto New Horizons is currently about 1,000 days away and 730 million miles from closest approach to Pluto. Since the spacecraft blasted off in 2006, the distant world has become an even more enticing goal, with a fifth moon discovered around it in July. The impacts that may have created this system of moons as well as collisions they have likely had with other bodies in the Kuiper Belt where the distant world resides also suggests debris might have collected into rings around Pluto. Although these finds reveal that Pluto is a trove of treasures worth exploring, \"we're worried that Pluto and its system of moons, the object of our scientific affection, may actually be a bit of a black widow,\" Stern said. \"We've come to appreciate that those moons, as well as those not yet discovered, act as debris generators populating the Pluto system with shards from collisions between those moons and small Kuiper Belt objects.\" Given how New Horizons is currently zooming away from the sun at more than 33,500 mph, \"a collision with a single pebble, or even a millimeter-sized grain, could cripple or destroy New Horizons,\" said New Horizons project scientist Hal Weaver at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \"We need to steer clear of any debris zones around Pluto.\" To search for debris orbiting Pluto, the New Horizons team is now scanning it with ground and space telescopes and carrying out computer simulations of where this shrapnel might lie. \"We're not going to blindly send a billion-dollar-class missioninto harm's way,\" Stern told SPACE.com. \"We're going to rewrite what we know to achieve victory.\" Does Pluto have rings? Although researchers have spotted no signs of debris zones around Pluto yet, computer models have not ruled out such gauntlets of rubble. \"We have to take the conservative approach and assume the worst,\" Stern said. One strategy the researchers suggest is pointing New Horizons' dish antenna forward, \"to act as a meteorite shield to protect the spacecraft from impacts,\" Stern said. \"This technique is not new - the Cassini probe used that when crossing Saturn's ring plane as well.\" The researchers are now also making plans to avoid these hazards if New Horizons needs to. \"We are now exploring nine other options, 'bail-out trajectories,'\" Stern said. New Horizon's current plan would take it about halfway between Pluto and the orbit of its largest moon, Charon. Four of the bail-out trajectories would still take the spacecraft between Pluto and Charon's orbit. \"They would get maybe up to about 15 closer to Charon's orbit, but that can make a large difference in terms of safety,\" Stern explained. \"These zones would get scoured of debris by Texas-sized Charon. The other alternatives would take New Horizons much further away from Pluto, past the orbits of its known moons. \"If you fly twice as far away, your camera does half as well; if it's 10 times as far, it does one-tenth as well,\" Stern said. \"While placing New Horizons farther out would still accomplish the primary objectives we have for it, it would not exceed them. On our current path, we'd get imaging resolutions down to about a tenth of a kilometer for some places on Pluto, but if we fly substantially far away, we'd meet the 1-kilometer objective we had.\" \"Still, half a loaf is better than no loaf,\" Stern said. \"Sending New Horizons on a suicide mission does no one any good. We're very much of the mind to accomplish as much as we can, and not losing it all recklessly. Better to turn an A+ to an A- than get an F by overreaching.\" It remains uncertain what levels of risk might prompt the researchers to change New Horizons' course - say, a 25 percent chance of hitting a millimeter-sized grain, or a 10 percent chance of hitting a centimeter-sized pebble. \"We're working on making recommendations to NASA regarding that later this year, and then with NASA the project team will make that decision if the time comes,\" Stern said. The latest the research team can alter the spacecraft's trajectory is about 10 days before it gets to Pluto. \"After that, there's not enough fuel to make a change,\" Stern explained. \"We don't often get into situations in spaceflight where we have to make last-minute decisions. We're going to learn as much as possible before our final approach in 2015.\" The scientists detailed their research today at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences in Reno, Nevada.

The 60-something lecturer who is now semi-retired after clocking up over 40 years on the job, was recently awarded the Vice Chancellors' Medal for Teaching Excellence at Melbourne's Monash University. But that doesn't mean he's slowing down. The Oxford University trained astronomer is still actively researching and sees New Horizons as more than a vehicle for exploring far-off worlds. \"It's a tool that will allow us to test predictions relating to ideas about how the solar system formed,\" says Prentice, who has made several predictions about our solar system that have been proven correct by NASA missions. Launched in 2006, New Horizons is now 3.4 billion kilometres away and flying towards the orbit of Neptune, the most distant planet in the solar system. But it still has another 1.3 billion kilometres to go before reaching Pluto and the Kuiper belt, a place of dark frozen worlds, cometary bodies and icy debris left over from the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. # Moon gazing New Horizons is one of the fastest spacecraft ever built, travelling at over 55,000 kilometres an hour, to reach Pluto before the plutonian winter. Its historic voyage has already taken it beyond the red deserts of Mars, over the stormy cloud tops of Jupiter, around its moons, and past the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. It's a neighbourhood Prentice knows well, having successfully predicted the location of a family of new moons in orbit around Neptune in 1989. \"That was possibly my biggest triumph,\" says Prentice. \"We did the calculations and they showed up right on cue where they should be.\" His calculations about the ringed world of Saturn and it's many moons have also proven remarkably accurate. \"Titan is huge, it's bigger than the planet Mercury and my data indicates it would have originally formed independently as a planet only to be later captured by Saturn's gravity,\" says Prentice. If his hypothesis is correct, Prentice says Titan should have a slightly oblate structure. \"Well, Titan did turn out to be oblate, and that could only happen if it formed in a free orbit as I predicted,\" says Prentice. \"I don't want you to think we have all the answers, we still have a lot of work to do which is why New Horizons will be so important.\" # Destination Pluto When it reaches Pluto in 2015, New Horizons will spend five months exploring the dwarf planet and its five-known moons. It will make its closest approach to Pluto and its largest moon Charon, on 14 July, undertaking hundreds of scientific observations with its onboard instruments, shedding new light on these distant worlds. According to calculations Prentice made 20 years ago, Pluto and Charon were once a single rocky body covered in a mix of water ice, dry ice and methane ice. But this proto-Pluto object may have spun so fast that the rock and ice separated, flinging the icy outer mantle into orbit to create Charon. \"Charon today, is thus predicted to be a layered ball of dry ice, water ice and methane ices,\" says Prentice. He predicts that both Charon and Pluto - which has a rock-graphite core and icy mantle - will be \"quite smooth and nearly crater-free, consistent with worlds that once had deep outer liquid mantles.\" On the other hand, the four distant moonlets - thought to be icy asteroids that were captured by the Pluto-Charon system - will be craggy, heavily cratered and irregular in shape, he says. \"In addition, Pluto and Charon are expected to be brighter in appearance than the outer moons, whose surfaces are rendered grey and dull through their graphitic component.\" While waiting to see if his predictions are correct, Prentice is keeping busy. \"I've been lucky enough to have teamed up with NASA and been involved with many of their planetary missions,\" he says. \"It's not good to have too many irons in the fire at one time.\" \"But last year I was working on Cassini with Titan, Mercury which is being visited by Messenger, and the asteroid Vesta which was being studied by the Dawn spacecraft and is now on its way to another asteroid Ceres\". \"Then there's all the exciting new data that will be coming out of Mars from the new rover Curiosity,\" say Prentice \"And the new discoveries lurking at the edge of the solar system, all these new Kuiper Belt objects and what's caused them.\" \"There's a lot still to do.\" Dr Andrew Prentice is a planetary mathematician at Monash University.

This preliminary finding could make life even more difficult for the team planning NASA's New Horizons mission, which is slated to take the first-ever up-close look at the Pluto system in July 2015. After Pluto's fifth known moon, a small satellite known as P5, was discovered last year, officials said they may need to redraw the spacecraft's path to avoid such obstacles. \"It has our attention,\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern told SPACE.com via email, referring to the new research. He added he hasn't thoroughly analyzed the work yet. The study was submitted to The Astronomical Journal and is currently available on the prepublishing site Arxiv. Photos: Pluto and its 5 Moons Dusty mystery The potential moons, which would each measure just 0.6 miles to 1.8 miles across, arose in a simulation looking at how Pluto 's known small satellites came to be. Earlier in Pluto's history, a dust cloud surrounded the dwarf planet. Researchers still aren't sure where that dust came from, though they have some ideas. Pluto's largest moon Charon, for example, might have slammed into the dwarf planet, producing debris. Alternatively, Pluto's gravity could have swept up dust lingering from the protoplanetary disk that formed the solar system. However the debris appeared, researchers believe Pluto's four known smaller moons - P4, Nix, P5 and Hydra - gradually formed as the dust collided and clumped together, forming bigger and bigger objects. To watch that in action, one scientific duo implemented calculations they previously used to look at planet formation and the origins of objects in the Kuiper Belt, a gigantic collection of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. Likely invisible from Earth The duo, led by Scott Kenyon of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, stepped their computer simulations through what happened after the debris was generated. The computer program treats smaller particles statistically. Once objects get above a certain size, roughly 0.62 miles across, then the program renders them individually. That's when the tiny satellites pop up. It's hard to say how many there are, the researchers said, as it's difficult to simulate collisions among these tiny satellites. There could be anywhere from one to more than 10 objects lurking beyond Hydra's orbit. While the team can simulate these satellites, they said it's unlikely they could be spotted from Earth. The brightness of the potential objects dance with the edge of the Hubble Space Telescope 's capabilities, Kenyon said, and they are likely beyond the reach of even the most sensitive ground-based telescopes, such as the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. \" Pluto is so bright,\" Kenyon said, explaining that the light washes out its satellites. \"I don't think a ground-based telescope would have a chance, and it's at the limit of what HST can do.\" New Horizons might be able to spot smaller satellites before it gets there, but Kenyon said he wasn't sure when the objects would appear big enough for the spacecraft to detect. The satellites would be \"easily visible\" during the spacecraft's closest approach to Pluto in 2015, the paper noted. Implications for exoplanets While the discovery of P4 motivated the scientists' look at the Pluto system, the research also has implications for understanding how exoplanets form around binary or double stars. Pluto and Charon are so close in size that Pluto is often considered a binary dwarf planet. Since NASA's planet-hunting Kepler space telescope has found lots of planets around binary stars, modeling Pluto's system could be a \"laboratory,\" Kenyon said, to understand how distant planets form as well. \"We would use the same machinery, the same kind of calculation, to make planets around binary stars as to make satellites around binary planets,\" he said. \"It improves our understanding, and we can extend it to exoplanets.\" As for how the dust came to be, Kenyon said New Horizons could solve that mystery. Charon is much brighter and icier than other Kuiper Belt objects. If Pluto's small moons look similar to Charon, they probably formed from a giant impact. \"New Horizons will have enough measurements to infer differences in composition in the satellites around Pluto-Charon,\" he said. \"We'll have a better idea of what the origin of the material is.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/20181-pluto-moons-new-horizons.html"}, {"title": "Pluto's seasons and what New Horizons may find when it passes by", "date": "2013-05-02", "content": "One example of a recent paper that's laying out these kinds of predictions is by Leslie Young, recently published in Astrophysical Journal Letters : \" Pluto's Seasons: New Predictions for New Horizons .\" There's an earlier version of the paper posted at arXiv. In a way, this work is similar to Edwin Kite's paper about what happens to water on Mars over the course of climate cycles. For Pluto, the question is: what happens to nitrogen on Pluto over the course of its year? When and where does it freeze out of the air onto the ground? To establish context: Pluto, like Earth and Titan, has a nitrogen-rich atmosphere. It's a very thin atmosphere, its pressure measured in microbars. Earth's atmospheric pressure is, of course, about one bar. Titan's is 1.6 bars. Mars' is a hundred times more tenuous, less than 10 millibars. Pluto's is about a hundred times more tenuous again, less than 100 microbars. Which is really thin; but it's way thicker than the essentially airless exospheres at Mercury and the Moon. Pluto has plenty enough atmosphere for the world to have wind and weather and clouds, just like Venus and Earth and Mars and Titan. Nitrogen in Pluto's air is in equilibrium with nitrogen frost or ice on the ground. Broadly speaking, when Pluto warms up, ice sublimates to gas, and the atmospheric pressure goes up. When Pluto cools, you get frost and a lower atmospheric pressure. Changing seasons remove ice from the summer pole, and may re-deposit it at the winter pole. Pluto's seasons are much more extreme than those of any of the other windy worlds I've mentioned. With an eccentricity of 0.24, it ventures almost twice closer to the Sun at perihelion that at aphelion. Its rotation axis is highly tilted, about 120 degrees, giving it Uranus-like extreme seasons., Milankovitch-like cycles of axial tilt variation at Pluto are modest compared to those at Mars; Pluto's axial tilt ranges from 102 to 126 degrees.) Pluto's seasons are aligned with its orbit in such a way that the most recent equinox at Pluto was in 1989, at about the same time that Pluto reached perihelion. The geometry of the orbit means that both hemispheres receive similar amounts of solar energy over the course of the year, but the onset of summer in the northern hemisphere is much more rapid than the onset of summer in the southern hemisphere. Another oddity about this geometry is that, when you add it up over the whole year, any given spot near the pole receives more sunlight than any spot on the equator over a full Pluto year.

It Could Really Happen, Scientists Say", "date": "2013-07-03", "content": "While the naming gods have swatted away an attempt to christen one of Pluto's newfound moons \"Vulcan,\" the \"Star Trek\" universe may still leave its mark on the dwarf planet soon enough. After NASA's New Horizons spacecraft gets the first up-close views of Pluto in 2015, craters, mountains and other features spotted on the dwarf planet's surface could bear the names of famous \"Star Trek\" characters, researchers said. \"We might have craters called Sulu and Spock and Kirk and McCoy and so on,\" Mark Showalter of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., said during a Google+ Hangout today. Showalter led the team that used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to discover Pluto's two smallest known moons, which were announced in 2011 and 2012 with the pedestrian names P4 and P5, respectively. P4 is thought to be 8 to 21 miles wide, while P5 is tinier still at 6 to 15 miles across. The SETI Institute sponsored an online poll called Pluto Rocks to come up with better monikers for the two natural satellites. The runaway winner of the poll was Vulcan, which snagged 170,000 of the nearly 500,000 votes cast after it was suggested by actor William Shatner \" TV series). In the \"Star Trek\" universe, Vulcan is the name of both a planet and the pointy-eared beings who evolved there. However, the International Astronomical Union - the organization responsible for naming celestial objects - nixed the name. According to IAU rules, Pluto's moons must be named after characters associated with the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This connection was deemed too tenuous in the case of Vulcan, SETI officials said, adding that the name has also already been used in astronomy. The IAU accepted the second- and third-place finishers in the Pluto Rocks poll, so P4 and P5 are now officially known as Kerberos and Styx, respectively. Some of the other candidates from the contest will likely find new life as the names of Pluto surface features spotted by the New Horizons probe, which is slated to fly by the dwarf planet in July 2015. For example, Showalter said that if a large mountain exists on Pluto, it should bear the name of Sisyphus, a human condemned for all eternity to push a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down again. Scientists have much more freedom in naming the surface features of planets and moons than they do in attaching monikers to the celestial bodies themselves, Showalter added. So craters, valleys and plains may get all sorts of interesting names, some of them of much more recent origin. \"We know there are a lot of fans out there of the animated works of Walt Disney, and I'm hoping that someday Pluto will give us a place in which we can put the name of Mickey Mouse into the Pluto system as well,\" Showalter said. Pluto has five known moons. The largest by far, Charon, was discovered in 1978. Hubble detected the other four, finding Nix and Hydra in 2005, Kerberos in 2011 and Styx in 2012. There could be more Pluto satellites out there waiting to be discovered and named, however. \"I wouldn't be at all surprised if we pick up a few more as the New Horizons spacecraft gets a little closer,\" Showalter said.

This decision by the International Astronomical Union remains controversial among some scientists and many laypeople. And even as Pluto continues to stir controversy on Earth, a spacecraft is winging its way toward the outer solar system - and an encounter with Pluto in 2015. The New Horizons spacecraft will be the first spacecraft ever to sweep closely past Pluto. Mission principal investigator Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute spoke with EarthSky about the IAU's decision in May of 2011. The following is a re-print of that interview. EarthSky: Why are we going to Pluto? Alan Stern: We're going on New Horizons not to rewrite the textbooks but to write the textbooks for the first time about how dwarf planets work, how they operate, how their geology behaves, how they evolved through time, what their moons are like. It's really going to be revolutionary. EarthSky: When New Horizons launched in 2006, Pluto was still classified as a planet. Just a few months later, the International Astronomical Union voted to demote Pluto to dwarf planet status. How do you feel about the IAU's decision? Alan Stern: I think it's really obvious to many if not most planetary scientists that objects of this scale, thousands of kilometers across, are planets. They have all the attributes of planets. They have crusts and cores; they have atmospheres and moons; they have seasons. And we can go on down the list. To every recognizable attribute that we associate with planethood, Pluto is a planet. And many planetary scientists and, of course, many people in the public just discount the IAU's wrongheaded vote and still consider it a planet, as I do, because we know that if you were to show up in a spacecraft at Pluto and take a look, you certainly wouldn't classify it as a rock or anything else. It's obviously a planet by every comparison. I like to make the analogy that a chihuahua is still a dog. EarthSky: Tell us more about the New Horizons mission. Alan Stern: We launched the mission in January of 2006 on a nearly 10-year voyage all the way across the depths of space to the farthest planet ever explored. Even though we're the fastest mission ever launched, it takes nine and a half years to get there. Today the spacecraft is speeding on towards its arrival at the Pluto system in July of 2015. The spacecraft is in great health. The instruments are working perfectly. We have lots of fuel on board, not just to explore Pluto and its moons, but to go on deeper into the Kuiper Belt, and I just couldn't be happier. We have a great team of people taking care of the spacecraft, planning the encounter. And we can't wait for 2015. EarthSky: What's going on with New Horizons now? Alan Stern: One of the secrets of New Horizons, the way that we keep the costs down, is that we're a very small team. And the same people who plan our operations every year have to also plan the Pluto encounter. And so we put the spacecraft to sleep, turn off many of the unnecessary systems a lot like you might put your house to sleep if you went on vacation. Not everything is turned off. You leave a few lights on. The phone still rings. You might turn the air conditioner on to a different temperature to save energy. We do something very similar with New Horizons about nine months out of the year. And we have to wake it up a couple of times during the year, the main event of which is every summer, we wake up for about 10 weeks to test all the onboard systems, to test and recalibrate our instruments, sometimes to improve the onboard software, those kinds of things. EarthSky: We've heard you speak of what you called the \"Star Trek test\" for what qualifies as a planet. Tell us about that. Alan Stern: It's not really based on Star Trek, but I use Star Trek as an illustration. All of us have watched Star Trek. And whenever a starship shows up in a new place, and they turn on the viewfinder on the bridge, the audience knows within a moment, as does the crew on the bridge, whether they're orbiting a star or spacecraft, or a planet, or a little asteroid or what-have- you. They don't need to survey the whole solar system. They don't need to integrate orbits. It's pretty easy to tell a planet when you see one, just by its attributes. EarthSky: You said a few years ago you believe that when New Horizons passes Pluto and the pictures are sent back, everyone who looks at those pictures will agree that Pluto should have retained full planet status. Do you still feel that way? Alan Stern: I think they'll think, wow, what was all the controversy about? That's obviously a planet. Bottom line: On August 24, 2006, Pluto was demoted from full planet status to dwarf planet status. A spacecraft is now en route to Pluto. Alan Stern, lead scientist of the New Horizons mission to Pluto, talked to EarthSky in 2011 about the mission and about the IAU's decision to demote Pluto.

Get it on NASA's Pluto-bound spacecraft", "date": "2013-09-27", "content": "A group of renowned scientists, engineers, artists and others need your help to send a message into the universe aboard a spacecraft bound for Pluto. NASA's New Horizons mission - launched toward Pluto in 2006 - should be carrying a self-portrait of humanity when it flies into interstellar space in about 30 years, according to Jill Tarter, SETI Institute co-founder; Jon Lomberg, the design director of the golden record containing sounds and images from cultures on Earth flying with the Voyager spacecraft; and other researchers. To that end, the diverse group of space fans have created a petition - called the New Horizons Message Initiative - asking NASA officials to upload a yet- to-be-determined crowdsourced message from humanity onto the New Horizons craft after its encounter with the Pluto system. 13 Ways to Find Intelligent Alien Life. \"This website is an opportunity for anyone who is interested to sign a petition that asks NASA to approve the future use of the spacecraft,\" Tarter said. \"We need formal permission from the agency and sub-support to make this happen.\" The message initiative hinges upon using some of the spacecraft's memory to store messages from earthlings and beamed up to the probe. The uploaded message could serve as a new, more candid kind of cosmic note from earthlings, Tarter said. The golden record onboard NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft is carrying \"the most rosy picture of humanity out there for the cosmos to discover,\" Tarter said here at the 100 Year Starship symposium. \"When New Horizons gets past Pluto, and has done all its data and is going on the slow boat to the heliopause, then it might be possible to just reprogram about 100 megabytes of its memory and upload a new sights and sounds of Earth that are not created by a small group of scientists but, in fact, are globally crowdsourced,\" Tarter said. Before New Horizons launched, NASA officials discussed including an onboard message, but decided against it. \"After we got into the project in 2002, it was suggested we add a plaque and I rejected that simply as a matter of focus,\" Alan Stern, New Horizons' principal investigator, told Space.com partner collectSpace.com in 2008. \"We had a small team on a tight budget and I knew it would be a big distraction. I didn't want to see us being distracted from the project and find ourselves derailing the project or getting into flight and finding we had some problem and wishing we'd have been more focused during development.\" The New Horizons message will act as an updated, inclusive golden record, according to officials working with the initiative. \"Like the Voyager Record, this will be both a message from Earth and a message to Earth,\" Lomberg said in a statement. \"The very act of creating it will be a powerful reminder that we all share a common heritage and future on this 'pale blue dot' we call Earth.\" NASA funds will not be used for the project, but initiative officials are asking for support from private individuals.

Launched in 2006, it has been in flight longer than some missions last, and it is nearing its destination: Pluto. \"The encounter begins next January,\" says Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute and the mission's principal investigator. \"We're less than a year away.\" Closest approach is scheduled for July 2015 when New Horizons flies only 10,000 km from Pluto, but the spacecraft will be busy long before that date. The first step, in January 2015, is an intensive campaign of photography by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager or \"LORRI.\" This will help mission controllers pinpoint Pluto's location, which is uncertain by a few thousand kilometers. \"LORRI will photograph the planet against known background star fields,\" explains Stern. \"We'll use the images to refine Pluto's distance from the spacecraft, and then fire the engines to make any necessary corrections.\" At first, Pluto and its large moon Charon will be little more than distant pinpricks-\"a couple of fat pixels,\" says Stern-but soon they will swell into full-fledged worlds. By late April 2015, the approaching spacecraft will be taking pictures of Pluto that surpass the best images from Hubble. By closest approach in July 2015, a whole new world will open up to the spacecraft's cameras. If New Horizons flew over Earth at the same altitude, it could see individual buildings and their shapes. Stern is looking forward to one of the most exciting moments of the Space Age. \"Humankind hasn't had an experience like this-an encounter with a new planet-in a long time,\" he says. \"Everything we see on Pluto will be a revelation.\" He likens New Horizons to Mariner 4, which flew past Mars in July 1965. At the time, many people on Earth, even some scientists, thought the Red Planet was a relatively gentle world, with water and vegetation friendly to life. Instead, Mariner 4 revealed a desiccated wasteland of haunting beauty. New Horizons' flyby of Pluto will occur almost exactly 50 years after Mariner 4's flyby of Mars-and it could shock observers just as much. Other than a few indistinct markings seen from afar by Hubble, Pluto's landscape is totally unexplored. Although some astronomers call Pluto a \"dwarf\" planet, Stern says there's nothing small about it. \"If you drove a car around the equator of Pluto, the odometer would rack up almost 5,000 miles-as far as from Manhattan to Moscow.\" Such a traveler might encounter icy geysers, craters, clouds, mountain ranges, rilles and valleys, alongside alien landforms no one has ever imagined. \"There is a real possibility that New Horizons will discover new moons and rings as well,\" says Stern. Yes, Pluto could have rings. Already, Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Numerical simulations show that meteoroids striking those satellites could send debris into orbit, forming a ring system that waxes and wanes over time in response to changes in bombardment. \"We're flying into the unknown,\" says Stern, \"and there is no telling what we might find.\" ", "url": "https://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2014/01/16/nasas-new-horizons-spacecraft-nears-destination-planet-pluto/"}, {"title": "Pluto New Horizons mission: The dwarf planet explains the history of our solar system", "date": "2014-02-05", "content": "It's time to stop throwing pity parties for Pluto. The beloved not-quite- planet is about to become the star of our solar system. I'll go out on a limb and predict that in July 2015, the up-close photos of Pluto we'll get from a NASA spacecraft will be the most popular astronomical images of a generation. Screensavers, posters, live TV, Twitpics, you name it-Pluto will be everywhere. After all, we've been wondering what it looks like for decades. But even now-and this is what most people don't realize about Pluto-we owe that little iceball a ton of respect. It led the way to a brand-new view of what our solar system is really made of. Here's the answer in advance: Almost all of the worlds circling our sun are like Pluto. There are thousands of them. Pluto's orbit, which used to seem weird, also showed us the violent history of how the big planets-the ones that get all the glory-got to where they are now. Its idiosyncrasies gave us the first, and best, clues about the history of our little nook of the Milky Way. In other words, Pluto rules, regardless of what we humans deign to call it. Formerly our ninth planet, Pluto was downgraded to \"dwarf planet\" in 2006 by some stuffy folks at the International Astronomical Union. A lot of astronomers disagreed, and Plutophiles howled. But the deal was done, and Pluto became a trendy verb. \"I've been Plutoed\" is a terrible thing to hear at the office. Even diminutive Tom Cruise got into it. A character in his Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol movie whined to him about a codename: \"Why am I Pluto? It's not even a planet anymore.\" All this angst over something that, to be charitable, is a smudge of light. No missions have flown past Pluto, so we're limited by what we see in telescopes. The object, with a surface area the size of Russia, is so far away-currently about 3 billion miles, more than 30 times the distance between Earth and the sun-that even the best telescopes show Pluto as an indistinct disk with light and dark patches. It has a gossamer atmosphere, frosts made of nitrogen and methane and carbon monoxide, and a whopping moon called Charon. The Hubble Space Telescope has spotted other flecks of light circling Pluto: four more moons. Most everyone thinks Pluto has a bunch of other companions. Beyond that, Pluto has remained mysterious. That will all change in 17 months. On July 14, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft will whip past Pluto at more than 30,000 miles per hour after a flight lasting almost a decade. It carries what mission director Alan Stern calls \"the best first-reconnaissance set of instruments for a planet, ever.\" We've had some amazing first looks at the four giant planets over the decades: majestic Jupiter and its bizarre moons, Saturn's ethereal rings, and the ocean-hued Uranus and Neptune. If you're old enough to remember the transformations of those bodies from blobs to fully realized worlds by the Voyager missions, you know the potential impact of Pluto's debut. Not long ago I visited Stern at his home base, the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. SwRI is Obsession Central for Pluto, and Stern is at the core of it. He's an intense man with a compact build, a flier of high- altitude jets, and a former official at NASA. He can tell you, down to the minute, what the spacecraft and its observing tools will do during the zippy encounter. His nimble team has practiced the entire event many times. And he bristles, rightfully so, when any story, I must confess) refers to Pluto as an \"oddball\" or a \"misfit.\" \"Pluto was the harbinger of knowledge that the solar system has thousands of planets, and nearly all of them are tiny,\" Stern says. Pluto and those other icy worlds inhabit a vast realm of the solar system called the Kuiper Belt. New Horizons will pay the first visit to such a world. The biggest question is about Pluto's surface: Is it alive or dead? Pluto's craters, ridges, valleys, and other landforms may have been frozen and locked in place for eons. The sculpted ices of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide would look eerie and beautiful, but it's less interesting scientifically if Pluto is stuck that way. There's a chance-despite surface temperatures of about minus-400 degrees Fahrenheit-that some internal source of heat could make Pluto's surface ooze, flow, and perhaps erupt with icy geysers. The largest moon of Neptune, called Triton, ebbs and shifts in such ways, creating fabulously exotic terrains. Scientists think Triton is one of Pluto's cousins, captured by Neptune from the Kuiper Belt billions of years ago. Comparing the two worlds, so unlike anything else we've seen up close, will consume scientists for years. Pluto's tenuous atmosphere is another focus for New Horizons. From Earth, it's a nearly imperceptible wisp around Pluto's margins. The light-and-dark patterns seen by Hubble are the barest hint that the atmosphere and the surface interact as the planet's climate changes. Pluto's oval orbit takes it so far away that the atmosphere may freeze out as bright crystals onto a surface tinged red by methane. The spacecraft also may see clouds and fog: Plutonian meteorology, driven by the planet's all-natural global warming and cooling. The barely-there atmosphere has kept us from knowing exactly how big Pluto is. Marc Buie, Stern's colleague at SwRI, wrote his Ph.D. thesis on Pluto as a last-minute swap 30 years ago, and the planet's elusive size has fascinated him since. \"We're finally going to know the diameter of Pluto!\" he told me in an urgent voice that only an obsessed scientist could conjure. For the record, Buie's published estimate is 2,306 kilometers in diameter. But Buie confided: \"I think it's closer to 2,320 kilometers.\" Pluto's retinue of moons entices the team as well. Charon, first spotted in 1978, is so bulky compared with its parent-about one-tenth the mass of Pluto-that scientists regard the Pluto-Charon system as a double planet. The other moons orbit this pair: icy shards called Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Here's the nifty part: Those four moons take almost precisely three, four, five, and six times longer to orbit Pluto, respectively, than Charon does. It's cold clockwork on a satellite scale. To the SwRI team, this waltz points to a long-ago cataclysm. Some other object from the Kuiper Belt-Stern thinks it was about 600 miles wide-slammed into Pluto to spawn Charon and the other whirling bits. Gravitational kicks and ongoing collisions with smaller debris then shifted the orbits, over time, into the synchrony we see today. If true, that scenario suggests Pluto has more moons; Stern wouldn't be surprised if he saw at least 10. Crash remnants could be spinning in New Horizons' path, so an onboard telescope will peer ahead next spring and summer. If the approaching spacecraft has to avoid plowing into smaller fragments, it would be a rather more graceful version of the famous asteroid-dodging sequence in Star Wars -fitting for a mission led by a jet jockey. Then there's Pluto's orbit, which gave Pluto its oddball reputation ever since Clyde Tombaugh identified it as a planet in 1930. Pluto's languid 248-year- long path tilts way out of the flattened plane in which the other planets orbit the sun. It also swoops near and far, lasso-style. To SwRI theorist Hal Levison, that orbit is a thing of beauty. It's his portal to an outer solar system full of objects on similar orbits. Those motions, he says, preserve traces of a wilder past. The major clue came from a curious bond between Pluto and Neptune. As Neptune orbits the sun three times, Pluto orbits exactly twice-in such a way that the bodies never approach one another. This stable connection, called a \"resonance,\" doesn't arise by chance. The planets must nudge one another via gravity and migrate into those orbital paths until the lengths of their orbits form a neat ratio. Then gravity keeps them there. This happened to Pluto's moons, too-and astronomers see the same thing around other stars, where some exoplanets orbit in syncopated lockstep. In our solar system, Neptune took the lead. It's so much bigger than Pluto that it dictated how and when Pluto moved. In the 1980s other scientists proposed that Neptune formed closer to the sun and gradually moved outward, pushing Pluto into the off-kilter loop we now see. The reaction to this idea was tepid until the 1990s, when telescopes started spotting other objects in the Kuiper Belt. \"Pluto is not the lone weird thing,\" Levison says. Indeed, there are \"plutinos,\" which share the same 2-to-3 orbital bond with Neptune, and \"twotinos,\" which orbit the sun once for each two of Neptune's years. They all got swept into those paths by Neptune's outward march. This new vision, an outer solar system sculpted by the gravity of Neptune, has taken hold. \"Neptune controls everything now,\" Levison says. But he and his colleagues didn't stop there. They used Pluto and the rest of the Kuiper Belt to map out a grander, much more startling picture of our entire solar system's youth. All four giant planets, they claim, crowded closer together in their orbits in the early age of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. They gravitationally tugged on one another, along with swarms of smaller bodies, for hundreds of millions of years. Then, in a spasm set off by an unstable connection between Jupiter and Saturn, the planets migrated violently. Neptune and Uranus might have swapped places. Jupiter's gravity might have even cast a fifth giant planet out of the solar system. As Neptune raced outward and the other planets shifted, they flung asteroids and comets into an icy, rocky blizzard. Levison came up with the provocative idea, and many astronomers think it's plausible. Clues are everywhere, he says. Chief among them are the orbits of Pluto's brethren in the Kuiper Belt. They career every which way, but their paths-when mapped mathematically-trace back to an epoch of wandering planets. Mercury and our moon hold other clues: big craters whose ages and patterns suggest a massive storm of comets and asteroids set off by the moving planets, in a pulse lasting 100 million years or so. If Pluto and Charon are frozen relics, their surfaces may preserve records of this intense bombardment, too. Charting their roles in the chaotic history of the outer solar system is one more mystery New Horizons may solve. As for Pluto's demotion, Levison isn't concerned. \"Clyde Tombaugh discovered the Kuiper Belt,\" he told me, his eyes locked on mine. \"That's a helluva lot more interesting than the ninth planet. Pluto is the granddaddy of the most populated region in the solar system, with the most to tell us about our history. It must not mind.\" Stern and his team hope to steer New Horizons toward another, much smaller object in the Kuiper Belt after they bid farewell to Pluto. But for now, the Pluto system has Stern's full attention. It's probably the only time we'll go there in the next half-century, and he's not going to muck it up. He knows how excited we all will be. Years ago Stern asked his colleagues to write predictions for what we'll discover at Pluto and seal them in manila envelopes, to be opened after July 2015. Stern doesn't need to unseal his prediction; he recalls it word for word. \"What we will find,\" he wrote, \"is something wonderful.\" ", "url": "https://slate.com/technology/2014/02/pluto-new-horizons-mission-the-dwarf-planet-explains-the-history-of-our-solar-system.html"}, {"title": "Life After Pluto: New Horizons Could Carry Your Message to the Stars", "date": "2014-05-20", "content": "NASA's New Horizons spacecraft will be working at capacity during its flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto and its moons in July 2015 - but after the flyby is finished, it'll move on to its next objectives: looking for other icy objects on the solar system's rim, and carrying messages from Earth to the stars. The next few months will be key for laying the groundwork for New Horizons' post-Pluto projects. One piece of that groundwork is in place already, thanks to NASA's go-ahead for the New Horizons Message Initiative. Another piece will be the subject of debate in just a couple of weeks, when scientists meet to draw up the Hubble Space Telescope's to-do list. Let's start with the messages: Over the weekend, organizers of the New Horizon Message Initiative announced that NASA has agreed to upload a crowdsourced set of digital \"selfies\" to the spacecraft after it sends out the data from the Pluto flyby. The $650 million New Horizons mission was built on an extremely tight budget, and that means there was no room for anything addressed to extraterrestrials. There was no \"Hello, We're Humans\" plaque like the ones placed on the Pioneer probes; no Golden Record like the ones included on the Voyager missions. Jon Lomberg, an artist and journalist who collaborated with the late astronomer Carl Sagan on Voyager's Golden Record, thought that was a shame. Eventually he came up with the idea of sending out a digital message file to New Horizons in flight, and sold the mission's managers on the idea. This time, the messages will be chosen by the whole wide world, rather than an elite group of culture vultures. \"It was very presumptuous of Carl Sagan and the rest of us to speak for Earth, but at the time it was either do it that way or don't do it at all,\" Lomberg told National Geographic. The Message Initiative is to get under way in earnest on Aug. 25, when New Horizons is due to cross the orbit of Neptune. That day marks exactly 25 years since Voyager 2 made its own Neptune flyby, and NASA will celebrate the occasion with a \"ceremonial handing of the torch\" at its Washington headquarters. Starting in August, the OneEarthMessage.org website will take in submissions of various types - images, sounds, text, computer code - and put them to a vote. Lomberg's partner on the project, crowdsourcing specialist Albert Yu-Min Lin, is working on a system to prioritize the messages and put the winning entries into a file that would be uploaded to New Horizons once the probe's computer memory is freed up. Lomberg acknowledges there's little chance that aliens will ever find and decode the message. But the true point of the exercise is something closer to home: What are the most important things to say about life on Earth? And will identifying those things help us appreciate them more? That was certainly the case for the Golden Record, and it's likely to be the case for the New Horizon Message as well. So when will the message be uploaded? That depends on New Horizons' post-Pluto scientific program. It could take months for the spacecraft to transmit all of its data from the Pluto flyby - and when that's finished, there's a chance that the probe will gear up for yet another encounter. The science team wants to study at least one more object in the Kuiper Belt, the broad, sparsely populated band of icy mini-worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. If the right object is found, the message upload would be delayed until after New Horizons executes its follow-up encounter. That's OK with Lomberg: \"As long as the spacecraft is healthy and the radio is working, there's no particular rush to send it before everyone's happy,\" he told National Geographic. However, so far the right object hasn't turned up, even though the New Horizons team has been poring over sky surveys. The best way to look for a good candidate would be to use the Hubble Space Telescope, and that option is due to come up for consideration next month during a round of meetings at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. Last month, two NASA advisory panels - the Small Bodies Assessment Group and the Outer Planets Assessment Group - expressed strong support for the idea of using Hubble to search for suitable Kuiper Belt objects. Small, primitive KBOs that were \"left over from the era of planet formation\" would be of particular interest. \"The scientific bounty of a spacecraft encounter with a primitive KBO is realizable in our lifetimes, but only with New Horizons, and only if a suitable target can be found while there is still time to reach it,\" the panels wrote. \"No other mission currently in flight, in build, or in design will reach the Kuiper Belt. Time is of the essence for New Horizons.\" The scientists said that a target would have to be identified this year in order to leave enough time for planning New Horizons' post-Pluto trajectory. \"The probability of a successful search substantially declines if postponed to 2015,\" they wrote. Will NASA's New Horizons mission turn into a \"twofer\" - or will it be Pluto, period? Stay tuned...

In July 2015, NASA's New Horizons probe will fly by frigid and faraway Pluto, which was demoted to \"dwarf planet\" in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union. The encounter will mark the first \"unveiling\" of a major solar system body since 1989, when NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by the ice giant Neptune, Pluto's nearest planetary neighbor. \"For most people, going to a brand-new planet - not back to Mars to rove a different place, but to a whole new place for the first time, and to see it revealed - is going to be an experience unlike anything they've ever seen,\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com earlier this year. \"I think we're going to have a chance to really enthuse people.\" Pluto: planet or not? Pluto had been known as the solar system's ninth planet since its 1930 discovery. But that all changed when the International Astronomical Union - the organization responsible for giving \"official\" scientific names to celestial objects - decided to revise its definition of \"planet\" in August 2006. That decision was based in part upon the growing realization that Pluto is far from the only large object in the Kuiper Belt, the ring of icy bodies that orbits the sun beyond Neptune. The biggest jolt came in 2005, when a team of astronomers led by Mike Brown of Caltech found Eris, a Kuiper Belt body that seemed to be even larger than Pluto. So on Aug. 24, 2006, the IAU came up with a new definition of \"planet\": a body that orbits the sun without being another object's satellite, is large enough to be rounded into a sphere by its own gravity and has \"cleared its neighborhood\" of most other orbiting bodies. Pluto was demoted to the newly created category of \" dwarf planet \" because it failed to meet the \"clear your neighborhood\" criterion. Some astronomers largely embraced the new classification, but others, such as Stern, were not at all happy. The neighborhood-clearing requirement particularly displeased Stern. \"In no other branch of science am I familiar with something that absurd,\" Stern told Space.com in 2011. \"A river is a river, independent of whether there are other rivers nearby. In science, we call things what they are based on their attributes, not what they're next to.\" Stern doesn't have a problem with the term \"dwarf planet.\" He just thinks that dwarf planets should be included in the ranks of \"true\" planets, along with rocky worlds such as Earth and gas giants like Saturn and Neptune. Excluding the dwarfs, which are likely incredibly numerous, seems like an attempt by the IAU to keep the number of true planets down to a manageable size, he said in 2011. \"That's not a very scientific way of going about it, since we have countless numbers of stars, galaxies, asteroids and everything else,\" Stern said. The New Horizons spacecraft launched in January 2006. Its historic flyby next summer may spur further conversation about the planethood of Pluto, which orbits the sun at an average distance of 3.65 billion miles - so far away that the object looks like a fuzzy ball in the best Hubble Space Telescope photos. The encounter will shine a very bright spotlight on Pluto, which remains largely mysterious more than 80 years after its discovery. For example, scientists didn't know the dwarf planet had any moons until 1978, when they spotted the big satellite Charon orbiting Pluto. At 750 miles across, Charon is about half as wide as Pluto itself. Recent observations by Hubble revealed four more moons, all of them tiny. Astronomers spotted Nix and Hydra in 2005, and discovered Kerberos and Styx in 2011 and 2012, respectively. New Horizons will search for additional moons around Pluto, and determine whether or not the dwarf planet has a ring system. The craft will also map the surface composition and characterize the geology of both Pluto and Charon, before flying on and continuing to explore the Kuiper Belt. The New Horizons mission should greatly increase researchers' understanding of Pluto, the Kuiper Belt and ice dwarfs in general, mission officials say. \"The United States has made history by being the first nation to reach every planet from Mercury to Neptune with a space probe,\" officials write on the New Horizons website, which is maintained by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt - the first NASA launch to a 'new' planet since Voyager more than 30 years ago - allows the U.S. to complete the reconnaissance of the solar system.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26181-nasa-pluto-flyby-planet-debate.html"}, {"title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson Turns Down Pluto Debate Challenge", "date": "2014-06-11", "content": "If you were looking forward to seeing astrophysicist and \"Cosmos\" host Neil deGrasse Tyson debate how Pluto should be classified, don't hold your breath. Tyson says he's done debating.

As director of New York's Hayden Planetarium, Tyson left Pluto out of the facility's main planetary lineup, and wrote a book about the controversy called \"The Pluto Files.\" The International Astronomical Union considers Pluto to be a dwarf planet, and not a full-fledged planet, because it has not \"cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.\" Stern told NBC News last week that Pluto deserved full planetary status, and he wanted to debate the issue with Tyson. \"I am challenging him to the equivalent of the 'Thrilla in Manila,'\" Stern said.

It seems hard to believe, considering that the surface temperature on Pluto and its moons is thought to be 380 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. But scientists say it's theoretically possible for Charon to have had a hidden sea of liquid water. The issue applies not only to Charon, but to other worlds thought to have ice- covered oceans to this day - including Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus. Even though those moons have frozen surfaces, planetary scientists say their interiors should be warm enough to allow for liquid water due to tidal flexing. Today, Charon and Pluto are tidally locked, which means any ocean Charon might have had should be frozen by now. But if Charon experienced large tides in the ancient past, the evidence of that should still be visible in the form of characteristic patterns of cracks in the moon's surface ice. The New Horizons team plans to document Charon's cracks when their spacecraft flies by in July 2015. \"Our model predicts different fracture patterns on the surface of Charon depending on the thickness of its surface ice, the structure of the moon's interior and how easily it deforms, and how its orbit evolved,\" Alyssa Rhoden of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said Friday in a NASA news release. \"By comparing the actual New Horizons observations of Charon to the various predictions, we can see what fits best and discover if Charon could have had a subsurface ocean in its past, driven by high eccentricity.\" Rhoden is lead author of a paper on this research, available online in the journal Icarus. If scientists determine Charon once had an ocean, would that mean the moon could have sustained life? Liquid water is one of the requirements for life as we know it, but a sufficient energy source and the right mix of chemicals are required as well. Whether all those requirements were satisfied on ancient Charon is a complicated scientific issue, just as it is for present-day Europa and Enceladus.

Scientists will use the space agency's Hubble Space Telescope to search for another faraway object that could be visited by the New Horizons probe after its Pluto encounter, which is scheduled to take place in July 2015, NASA officials announced today. \"I am pleased that our science peer-review process arrived at a consensus as to how to effectively use Hubble's unique capabilities to support the science goals of the New Horizons mission,\" Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which operates Hubble, said in a statement. \"The planned search for a suitable target for New Horizons further demonstrates how Hubble is effectively being used to support humankind's initial reconnaissance of the solar system,\" he added. Hubble will perform a test run first, searching a small patch of sky in the constellation Sagittarius for objects in the Kuiper Belt, the ring of frigid bodies that circles the sun beyond Neptune's orbit. Spotting these small, dark bodies will be a challenge. Researchers will turn Hubble as fast as Kuiper Belt objects are predicted to move against the background stars. The stars will show up as streaks in the resulting images, while any KBOs will be captured as points, NASA officials said. If Hubble finds at least two KBOs with a specified brightness, researchers will carry out a bona fide hunt for an object beyond Pluto that New Horizons could visit. This search will cover a field of view about the size of the full moon, scientists said. This stepwise approach was chosen because time on the powerful Hubble is so coveted and contested, with requested observing time greatly exceeding actual observing time every year. Astronomers around the world apply to use the instrument; their proposals are reviewed by an expert committee, which passes on its recommendations to the STScI director. Hubble has already played a key supporting role in the $700 million New Horizons mission, which launched in January 2006 to give humanity its first up-close looks at the Pluto system. For example, Hubble has discovered four of Pluto's five known moons, spotting Nix and Hydra in 2005, Kerberos in 2011 and Styx in 2012. Hubble, which launched in April 1990, has also conducted a search for dust rings around the dwarf planet that could pose a danger to the fast-flying New Horizons.

NASA Spacecraft to Carry Message for Aliens", "date": "2014-06-23", "content": "A NASA probe that's expected to leave the solar system after it finishes its mission at Pluto and beyond will carry a message intended for any alien life- form that comes across it in the far future. When NASA's New Horizons mission completes its study of Pluto in the summer of 2015, data from Earth will stream to the spacecraft to create a digital record that it will carry with it beyond the solar system. The record echoes the Golden Record carried by NASA's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft in the 1970s and the plaques onboard the Pioneer spacecraft. Jon Lomberg, who served as design director for NASA's Voyager Golden Record, worked with late astronomer Carl Sagan and four others to select a series of sounds and images that were combined on a gramophone record as representative of Earth. When Lomberg realized that New Horizons would become the next object to leave the solar system, he launched an online petition to include a similar message for New Horizons, called the One Earth Message. See amazing photos from the Voyager probes The only problem was that New Horizons launched several years earlier, in 2006. Instead of creating a physical artifact, Lomberg suggested creating a digital one: streaming data to the spacecraft once it had completed its study of Pluto and its moon Charon. He referred to it as a \"digital Voyager record 2.0.\" \"In a way, the history of long-term space message artifacts recapitulates the history of communications technology,\" Lomberg said. The plaques onboard Pioneer 10 and 11, launched in March 1972 and April 1973, respectively, engraved images on metal and stone. Voyager's record was an analog recording on a record that few young people would know how to operate today. NASA's Phoenix mission to Mars carried digital recordings of literature and art about the Red Planet in 2007. By Feb. 18, 2014, Lomberg had gathered 10,000 signatures from 140 different countries. In May, at Smithsonian magazine's \"The Future is Here\" Festival in Washington, D.C., he announced that NASA had given his team the go-ahead for the project. \"I think you could hear us cheering all the way out to Pluto ,\" he said at the festival. An official announcement will be made Aug. 25, and will include information about the submission process and deadline. The One Earth message contains another significant difference from the earlier Voyager project: While a team of six created the iconic Golden Record over the course of six weeks, the New Horizons craft will carry messages assembled by people from around the world. \"Anyone who participates has a chance of having a photo they took sent out beyond Pluto, heading for the stars,\" Lomberg said. To accomplish the task, Lomberg and Albert Yu-Min Lin, a research scientist at the University of California, San Diego, plan to crowdsource the project by seeking ideas and services from large groups of people. Lin has experience in combining citizen science with scientific explanation, including for his Valley of the Khans project, where people around the world combed satellite imagery in search of the tomb of Genghis Khan. A more recent project involved bringing 8 million people together to search for the missing Malaysian airline flight in a single weekend. People from around the world will be able to submit their images and vote on those that should be included in the final message. Lomberg and others will exercise editorial control to ensure that no inappropriate materials make the cut, and NASA will make the final call. Inspiring a new generation When the spacecraft completes its mission and sends all of its data back to Earth, its computer memory will have room for a record from home. The One Earth Message will then be sent to the probe - a process that will likely take several days. Unlike previous records, the information on board New Horizons will not have to remain static. As long as the craft remains in communication with Earth, the message has the potential to be upgraded as the status of the planet changes. Although the spacecraft may never be found by extraterrestrials and its message may never be deciphered, Lomberg emphasized that the process itself has the potential to bring people together and reflect on what it means to be part of a global community. \"For almost 40 years, people have been inspired by the Voyager record, a portrait of the Earth in 1977,\" Lomberg said. \"The world is very different now, and this new message will reflect the hopes and dreams of the second decade in the 21st century. It will inspire young people's interest in science and ignite the imagination of all ages. We hope it will be an example of global creativity and cooperation, something that the entire planet can share as a cooperative venture, made possible by the new science of crowdsourcing.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26332-nasa-new-horizons-one-earth-message.html"}, {"title": "Telescope digs for ice on Pluto", "date": "2014-06-25", "content": "In just over a year, the New Horizons spacecraft will fly past Pluto, giving us our first detailed look at the dwarf planet. Anticipating this encounter, Ailsa Whitelaw and Jane Greaves from St. Andrews have used forgotten data to map the subsurface of Pluto, peering beneath its icy coating to uncover hidden chemicals that give a hint of the future of this distant world. Pluto is remote, orbiting at a distance of between 2.7-4.5 billion miles from the Sun. For that reason, even the best images made using the Hubble Space Telescope can only pick out features larger than a few hundred kilometers in size on a world itself just 1,400 miles across. The dwarf planet rotates every 6.4 days, so researchers also observe Pluto using ground-based telescopes looking at how its brightness varies to deduce whether light or dark features are facing Earth and hence construct maps of its surface. Whitelaw and Greaves adopted a new approach using data obtained from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Hawaii in the late 1990s. JCMT's SCUBA cameras operate in the submillimeter range of the spectrum, between far- infrared and microwave. Pluto was observed at 0.85mm wavelength, meaning the waves are about 1,000 times as long as our eyes can see and in a completely different region of the spectrum to any other data ever obtained from this distant world. The two scientists assembled a \"light curve,\" where brightness is plotted against time. As Pluto is rotating, the data points correspond to different longitudes on its surface. The 0.85mm waves are emitted from beneath the surface of the dwarf planet as seen in visible light, hinting at a different chemical mix in the subsoil. One possible explanation is that a relatively dry layer of frozen nitrogen and methane lies below a dark surface patch of water ice and frozen polymers. Because Pluto's surface slowly boils away in sunlight, this also gives scientists a sneak preview of its appearance thousands of years in the future. As well as their forensic analysis of Pluto's past and future, the new results show a hemisphere of the dwarf planet that New Horizons will miss seeing in detail. The spacecraft zooms through the Pluto system on July 14, 2015, but only has a few minutes to study one side of the dwarf planet and its largest moon Charon at close range. \"This was a bit like using a telescope as a digger to mine into Pluto, but with less effort,\" said Greaves. \" I'm really excited to see what New Horizons will find a year from now. Some researchers think that even deeper down, Pluto has liquid water, kept fluid by remnant heat from a big crash that formed its moons. If so, the surface will probably look wrinkled. But the flyby is so quick that we'll need to follow up - maybe with future radar we can dig down even further.\" The new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array now operating in Chile works at similar wavelengths and may be able to peer into the other icy dwarf planets discovered in the last decade.

But this summer, scientists are trying to figure out where to send the far-flung probe after its dwarf-planet flyby - and they've already found some promising leads. After a successful pilot survey, scientists with NASA's New Horizons mission were granted extra observing time with the powerful Hubble Space Telescope to hunt for a target in the mysterious Kuiper Belt, a debris field of icy bodies orbiting the sun beyond Neptune. Hubble officials said the telescope will begin its extended search for suitable Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs, in July and finish in August, scanning a field of view about the size of the full moon. If a target is found and NASA officials approve, the path of New Horizons can be modified in the fall of 2015 to rendezvous with the KBO three to four years later. Today, scientists have catalogued some 1,000 Kuiper Belt objects, but they think millions more asteroids, comets and dwarf planets await discovery in the region. It's not easy to find KBOs; Hubble can only identify these objects as they move against the background of distant starlight. Hubble performed its pilot search for a target in the Kuiper Belt from June 16 to June 26. The telescope trained its gaze on 20 areas in a patch of the sky in the constellation Sagittarius, producing some 200 images.

Because Pluto is so far away - it orbits the sun at an average distance of 3.65 billion miles - many questions about the dwarf planet's composition and activity remain unanswered. Researchers hope New Horizons will lay some of those questions to rest when it flies by Pluto on July 15, 2015. \"Many predictions have been made by the science community, including possible rings, geyser eruptions, and even lakes,\" Adriana Ocampo, program executive for NASA's New Frontiers program, said in a statement. \"Whatever we find, I believe Pluto and its satellites will surpass all our expectations and surprise us beyond our imagination.\" Orbiting the sun once every 248 years, Pluto lies outside the reach of most visual instruments. The best images from NASA's famous Hubble Space Telescope simply show Pluto's spherical shape and reddish color. Changes in the dwarf planet's color patterns over the years hint that something is happening there, but no one knows exactly what. By late April 2015, New Horizons will be close enough to Pluto and its moons to capture pictures rivaling those of Hubble. On July 14, 2015, the craft will make a close flyby of the icy world, ultimately zooming within about 6,200 miles of its surface. If it cruised past Earth at that range, New Horizons would be able to recognize individual buildings and their shapes. \"Because Pluto has never been visited up-close by a spacecraft from Earth, everything we see will be a first,\" Ocampo said. \"I know this will be an astonishing experience full of history-making moments.\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, likened the upcoming visit to the way Mariner 4revolutionized understanding of Marsin July 1965. At the time, many people thought the Red Planet was a life-friendly world possibly harboring liquid water and even plants. The New Horizons flyby could change perceptions of Pluto just as dramatically, Stern said. The flight in won't be without its challenges. Since New Horizons launched in 2006, two new moons have been discovered orbiting Pluto, upping the total known satellite countto five: Charon, Nix, Kerberos, Styxand Hydra. As many as 10 other moonscould still await detection in the system, one study suggested. According to simulations, meteorites striking Pluto's moons could send tiny rocks flying into space, where many of them would enter orbit around the dwarf planet. The debris field likely changes with time as it orbits, growing larger as new material is added. As the New Horizons probe gets closer and closer to Pluto, the mission team will need to keep watch on the system in case evasive maneuvers are required. \"The New Horizons team continues to do a magnificent job in keeping the spacecraft healthy and ready for this incredible rendezvous,\" said Ocampo. \"The spacecraft is in good hands.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26606-nasa-spacecraft-one-year-from-pluto.html"}, {"title": "NASA's New Horizons captures unique footage of Pluto and Charon", "date": "2014-08-13", "content": "Launched by NASA in 2006 and tasked to study Pluto, the New Horizons spacecraft captured unique footage of Charon revolving around Pluto, filmed from 265 million miles.

If all goes well, the nuclear-powered spacecraft, the centerpiece of a $700 million mission, will pass within about 6,200 miles of Pluto's icy surface at 7:49:59 a.m. EDT on July 14, 2015, studying the dwarf planet and its five known moons with the most powerful suite of instruments ever launched on an initial planetary reconnaissance mission. Even so, at Pluto's enormous distance from Earth -- so far that it will take radio signals some 4.5 hours to cross the gulf -- it will take days to beam back even a few high-priority images and a full nine months to transmit the complete set of encounter observations. By that point, New Horizons will be well on its way into the Kuiper Belt, a vast realm of comets and frigid leftovers from the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. With any luck, astronomers will find another dwarf planet along the spacecraft's trajectory for a second, even more remote flyby in the years ahead. For New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, the Pluto encounter and a chance to study one or more bodies in the Kuiper Belt herald a new era in planetary exploration, a first direct glimpse into a vast realm \"billions of miles across populated by trillions of comets and who knows how many small planets like Pluto.\" \"What we used to call the outer solar system, where giant planets reside, is actually the middle zone of the solar system,\" he said. \"It is the Kuiper Belt that is the third zone, the true outer solar system. And within it, a new class of planet, the dwarfs. We didn't know they were there, we thought Pluto was a misfit and now we see it in context.\" Stern said there are more dwarf planets in the solar system than \"all the giants and terrestrials combined. You might ask yourself, who's the misfit now?\" \"What New Horizons is doing is flying to the biggest, the brightest, the first discovered and for what we know, the richest, most complex of these dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt,\" Stern said. In a bit of cosmic coincidence, New Horizons' passage through Neptune's orbit 2.75 billion miles from Earth came 25 years to the day after NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past the giant blue world and its strange moon, Triton, in that program's final planetary encounter. Voyager project scientist Ed Stone marveled at the time that one could visit a new world for the first time just once. For Stern, that same experience with Pluto, the last of the original nine planets to be explored by a visiting spacecraft, is less than one year away. \"Some of us started on this quest to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt almost 25 years ago, about the time Voyager was making its flyby of the Neptune system,\" he said. \"I think of the Pluto system as a Christmas present that's been sitting under the tree for 25 Christmases, and were going to unwrap that present next July.\" Already, the spacecraft has snapped long-distance views of its quarry showing a star-like Pluto and a dimmer pinpoint of light that marks Charon. But no detail is yet visible. Even the powerful Hubble Space Telescope can do little more than see brightness variations across Pluto's surface. \"Even with all our modern technology, everything we know about the Pluto system today would probably fit on one piece of paper,\" Stern told reporters. \"What do we know? Well, we know that Pluto is surprisingly made primarily of rock, 70 percent rock by mass, it has a fascinating escaping atmosphere made up of nitrogen, the same thing that you're breathing in this room. \"Pluto has winds, it has polar caps, it has fascinating surface that we know is changing with time and an atmosphere that we know is undergoing global change.

The probe crossed the moon's orbit in nine hours and reached Jupiter for a gravity assist flyby in just 13 months, picking up a 9,000-mph velocity boost as it headed out on its lonely voyage to Pluto, spending most of its time in electronic hibernation. \"This is the fastest spacecraft ever launched, it made the crossing to Jupiter in just 13 months, arriving in February of 2007 where it precisely hit the aim point to fly on to Pluto eight years later,\" Stern said. \"We crossed the space between Jupiter and Saturn in record time, crossing Saturn's orbit in 2008 on to the orbit of Uranus, which we crossed in March of 2011. \"For the last three years we've been cruising at this high rate of speed across the next billion miles.

Actually, New Horizons is on the lookout for Pluto's moons in case any we don't know about pose a danger to the mission, and it just got close enough to detect one of the ones we do know about: Hydra. Hydra is the second-largest of Pluto's moons at a diameter of 114 km, and New Horizons was able to take some pictures of it as the spacecraft draws closer to its rendezvous with the Kuiper belt's famous non-planet. It's a distant, faint view for the time being, but the New Horizons team is excited to see that the spacecraft's instruments are functioning properly. New Horizons Science Team member John Spencer, of the Southwest Research Institute, said in NASA's release, \"We're thrilled to see it, because it shows that our satellite-search techniques work, and that our camera is operating superbly. But it's also exciting just to see a third member of the Pluto system come into view, as proof that we're almost there!\" Hopefully any potentially dangerous, unknown moons will be detected well in advance so that New Horizons can avoid them. The spacecraft will make its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015 on its mission to investigate the planet and the rest of the Kuiper belt, so we'll be getting a much better look at Pluto and its moons in the fairly near future.

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted a few objects that the New Horizons probe might be able to explore after it zooms past the Pluto system during a highly anticipated flyby on July 14, 2015. Mission team members are assessing the candidates now, to get a better understanding of their orbits - a difficult task that could take a few more months. \"We hope to know before the year is out, and we will keep you posted as soon as we've made a determination of whether there are reachable objects - we certainly hope so,\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute's Planetary Science Directorate in Boulder, Colorado, said during a news conference in late August. A long journey New Horizons launched in January 2006 on a $700 million mission to study Pluto and its five known moons. The probe's flyby should return the first up-close looks at the dwarf planet, which is so distant and dim that it remains cloaked in mystery more than eight decades after its 1930 discovery. \"Everything that we know about the Pluto system today could probably fit on one piece of paper,\" Stern said, adding that New Horizon's observations should provide \"a bonanza for science in so many ways.\" But the New Horizons team has never been fixated solely on Pluto. Stern and his colleagues are also preparing for a possible extended mission, which would send New Horizons out to explore another object in the Kuiper Belt - the ring of frigid bodies beyond Neptune's orbit that includes Pluto. Finding another Kuiper Belt object to explore has proven challenging, however. \"These are objects that are much smaller than Pluto, and probably much more primitive in terms of their chemistry and their appearance,\" Stern said. \"These are objects the size of counties, for example, not the size of planets. They're very faint.\" Indeed, mission scientists have spent about four years searching for post- Pluto targets, using some of the world's biggest ground-based telescopes. The hunt turned up some KBOs, but none of them was within New Horizons' fuel reach, Stern said. So the team applied for time on Hubble, which is always hotly contested. In June, the researchers were granted observation time on 200 Hubble orbits of Earth. The Hubble search is complete, and the New Horizons team is now going through the telescope's data. \"Hubble has done a spectacularly good job, and has yielded literally hundreds of images of that part of the sky, from which we've found some candidates,\" Stern said. \"We don't know if any of them, though, are within our fuel reach, and we won't still for some months, because we have to track them as they move in their orbits.\" New Horizons' fuel reach will apparently be a bit greater than the probe's handlers had originally envisioned. A trajectory-correction burn performed this summer was so accurate that an additional potential burn planned for January won't be necessary, mission officials said. \"This is a good omen for our hoped-for Kuiper Belt flyby because each burn we can cancel saves a little fuel and makes the Kuiper Belt mission more feasible,\" Stern wrote in a mission update last month. New Horizons has been in hibernation since Aug. 29. It will wake up on Dec. 6 to begin preparing for the Pluto flyby, which officially begins in January, team members said.

NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is set to awake on Dec. 6 from the last of its 18 hibernation periods and prepare for its initial approach towards Pluto, which will take place on Jan. 15. The spacecraft is scheduled to come as close as 6,200 miles from the surface of Pluto on July 14, 2015 -- the closest any man-made object has come to the dwarf planet. The mission marks the first visit outside Neptune's orbit to the Kuiper Belt, which consists of Pluto and thousands of objects that have not yet been identified, according to Spaceflight Now, a space news website. \"This is the first look at this new zone of rocky, icy planets,\" Michael Buckley, a public information officer for John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory told ABC News. \"This is what New Horizons is supposed to do.\" New Horizons is currently 2.9 billion miles from earth and was launched in January 2006 atop an Atlas V rocket. Pluto at the time was still considered a planet, with scientists later that year voting to demote its status to that of a dwarf planet. The spacecraft has over the last nine years frequently gone into hibernation for various amounts of time ranging from 36 to 202 days, all of which adds up to five years in total, to help conserve power and allow scientists time to make plans for its exploration in space. It transmits a beep once a week to alert scientists that it is still functioning properly. Once awakened on Dec. 6, New Horizons will transmit radio signals that will reach the Mission's control center, located at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, in about four hours at 9 p.m. eastern time. Scientists plan to use the next six weeks after it wakes to check its memory, navigation and other functions, starting the observation phase in January, taking photos and measurements of the dwarf planet and its moons while also observing its atmosphere and how it interacts with the sun. \"This is really quite an epic journey,\" Alan Stern, the lead investigator for the New Horizons mission from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., told Spaceflight Now. \"Three billion miles across the entirety of our planetary system, from the inner planets to the middle solar system to the third zone -- the Kuiper belt -- and for the first time. No voyage like this has been conducted since the epic days of Voyager, and nothing like it is planned again.\" The observation period will continue until April, with scientists predicting to have very clear imagery of the planet and its surroundings by May, better than those of the Hubble Space Telescope. New Horizon's will transmit the information throughout 2015 and most of 2016, ending transmission late that year, according to Spaceflight Now.

The New Horizons spacecraft, currently located 2.9 billion miles from Earth, had been in hibernation since August - with most of its systems turned off to reduce wear. But late Saturday, mission scientists received a confirmation signal from New Horizons at the probe's Mission Operations Center here at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The probe is now wide awake for its 2015 flyby of Pluto. At the time of its wakeup call, New Horizons was just over 162 million miles from Pluto. About 20 people gathered in a conference room here at APL to await the signal from New Horizons. NASA's New Horizon Pluto flyby mission operations manager Alice Bowman and operations team Karl Whittenburg watch screens for signals confirming that the New Horizons probe awoke from hibernation on Dec. 6, 2014. The New Horizons mission is managed from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Wake up, Pluto probe First word from the probe arrived at about 9:30 p.m. EST on Saturday - generating a burst of happy applause from the attendees, including Alan Stern, New Horizon's principle investigator, and Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary sciences. At 9:52 p.m. EST, mission managers confirmed that New Horizons was awake, with all systems functioning normally. The wakeup sets the stage for the probe's flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015. \"This is the turning of a page. This is changing from a mission in cruise to a mission at its destination,\" said Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Stern popped a champagne bottle and offered a toast to the mission following the signal confirmation. New Horizons even got a wakeup song to mark the occasion: the tune \"Where My Heart Will Take Me\" by English tenor Russell Watson. The song, which included a special greeting from Watson for New Horizons, was played in the mission operations center after the confirmation signal was received. You can hear Watson's New Horizons wakeup song here. English tenor Russell Watson recorded a special version of his song \"Where My Heart Will Take Me\" to help wake up NASA's New Horizons spacecraft on Dec. 6, 2014 ahead of the probe's 2015 Pluto flyby.

Epic Pluto encounter ahead New Horizons will begin its Pluto science campaign in January, and will make its closest approach to Pluto in July. It will explore the outer-most and most- populated region of the solar system, the Kuiper belt, which is full of rocky, icy objects that have remained largely unchanged since the formation of the solar system. \"This is the place that this spacecraft was built to operate, and these are the operations that this team has waited a decade to actually go and execute,\" Stern said. \"So it's game time.\" NASA launched the New Horizons mission in 2006 on a $700 million mission to be the first spacecraft ever to see Pluto and its five moons up close. The piano-size spacecraft is powered by a nuclear power source and has traveled nearly 3 billion miles to reach Pluto in a mere nine years, making it the fastest space probe ever launched. It has spent two-thirds of its journey in a hibernation state that has both prolonged the life of the instruments and reduced staff costs on the ground. While New Horizons has gone through 18 hibernation periods, sleeping for about 1,873 days in all, this is the last one before it begins taking data on the Pluto system. For 20 weeks of its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons will provide better photos of Pluto and its moons than those taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, Stern said. In analogy, if the spacecraft were flying over a city it would be able to count the individual buildings on the ground. New Horizons may also identify as-yet- unknown moons or rings around Pluto. At the wake-up event, Stern handed out small, 2-inch-long pencils - whittled down from extensive use. \"This is the metaphor for persistence,\" Stern said, holding up the pencil stub. \"Since this mission went through so many ups and downs - the way the exploration of Pluto did - I thought this was an appropriate thing to give away. It's very simple, but it's meaningful.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/27946-pluto-spacecraft-new-horizons-wakeup.html"}, {"title": "NASA's New Horizons awakens for meeting with Pluto", "date": "2014-12-07", "content": "In order to travel the distance, New Horizons -- launched from Earth on January 19, 2006 -- was put into hibernation for about two-thirds of its journey, or 1,873 days. As its long journey comes to an end, so too has that hibernation: at 9:53 p.m. EST, the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory confirmed that it had received the signal that indicated the pre- programmed \"on\" switch had toggled. The space probe is awake. \"This is a watershed event that signals the end of New Horizons crossing of a vast ocean of space to the very frontier of our solar system, and the beginning of the mission's primary objective: the exploration of Pluto and its many moons in 2015,\" said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern. New Horizons' stasis wasn't constant: the probe went into 18 separate sleeps on its journey, ranging between 36 and 202 days. This sleep cycle allowed the NASA team to monitor the probe while it was awake, and preserve it from wear and tear on its components, and reduce the risk of system failure, while it was asleep. Its awakening was programmed by the team back in August. \"Technically, this was routine, since the wake-up was a procedure that we'd done many times before, said New Horizons project manager Glen Fountain. \"Symbolically, however, this is a big deal. It means the start of our pre- encounter operations.\" Before the probe begins surveying Pluto and its system on January 15, the team on Earth will spend the next several weeks checking New Horizons, making sure it is fully operational, testing commands and sequences. They'll also test the probe's array of sensors: infrared and ultraviolet imaging spectrometers, a compact multicolour camera, a high-resolution telescopic camera, two powerful particle spectrometers and a space dust detector. The probe will be closest to Pluto on July 14, 2015, but there will be plenty to see, both before and after. The NASA team expects detailed views of the Pluton system by May; from July, it will be able to send detailed images of Pluto's moons, Charon, Hydra, Nix, Kerberos and Styx; after which, it will spend the next decade traversing the Kuiper belt. If it's still operational, it is expected that New Horizons will be 100 AU from the sun by 2038, and hopefully able to send data about the outer heliosphere. \"New Horizons is on a journey to a new class of planets we've never seen, in a place we've never been before,\" says New Horizons project scientist Hal Weaver, of APL. \"For decades we thought Pluto was this odd little body on the planetary outskirts; now we know it's really a gateway to an entire region of new worlds in the Kuiper Belt, and New Horizons is going to provide the first close-up look at them.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/nasas-new-horizons-awakens-for-meeting-with-pluto/"}, {"title": "NASA's New Horizons probe wakes up in time to photograph Pluto in 2015", "date": "2014-12-08", "content": "On Saturday night at 9:30 p.m. ET, an alarm clock went off for NASA's New Horizons probe, 2.9 billion miles away from Earth.

NASA's New Horizons probe today began its six-month approach to Pluto, which will culminate with the first-ever close flyby of the dwarf planet on July 14. \"We really are on Pluto's doorstep,\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern said last month during a news conference at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The $700 million New Horizons mission blasted off in January 2006 with the aim of lifting the veil on Pluto. The dwarf planet has remained a mystery since its 1930 discovery because it's so small and so far away. The piano-size spacecraft rocketed away from Earth at more than 36,000 mph, faster than any other probe. It has now covered about 3 billion miles during its nine-year journey through deep space. \"In a very real sense, this is the Everest of planetary exploration,\" Stern said of New Horizons. \"This mission represents the closing of the first era of planetary reconnaissance. We've made it to the farthest place, with the fastest spacecraft ever launched.\" New Horizons will use seven different science instruments to study Pluto and its five known moons. The mission's chief objectives include mapping the surface composition and temperature of Pluto and its largest moon, Charon; characterizing the atmosphere of Pluto and the geology of Pluto and Charon; and hunting for rings and additional satellites in the Pluto system. In the 1990s, researchers began to realize that Pluto is not a lonely misfit; rather, it's just one of many dwarf planets and other icy denizens of the far- flung Kuiper Belt, which lies beyond Neptune's orbit. So New Horizons' observations should help researchers better understand an entire class of solar system bodies, mission team members said. \"We are going to the archetypal Kuiper Belt planet,\" New Horizons co- investigator William McKinnon, of Washington University in St. Louis, said at the AGU news briefing. \"This mission will revolutionize our understanding of how the planets in the Kuiper Belt work.\" Small, icy worlds like Pluto are probably the most common type of planet in the entire universe, McKinnon added. The long encounter begins Though New Horizons remains about 134 million miles from Pluto, it has already begun taking the dwarf planet's measure: The science-observation campaign officially began today, marking the start of \"Approach Phase 1.\" Many of the images New Horizons gathers during this phase will be used to keep the spacecraft on target toward Pluto, with the first course-correction maneuver, if necessary, possibly occurring as early as March. But some of the photos will be taken for scientific purposes, Stern said, and New Horizons will also characterize the Kuiper Belt environment using two different plasma sensors and a dust-counting instrument. The pace of scientific activity will really start picking up in April, Stern added. And by mid-May, New Horizons will be close enough to snap the best-ever images of Pluto. It will only get more exciting from there. The most jaw-dropping images will be captured on and around July 14, when New Horizons zooms within about 6,000 miles of Pluto's surface. The closest-approach pictures will not all be available right away, however. As a result of budget constraints, New Horizons does not have an articulated high-gain antenna, meaning the spacecraft must orient itself toward Earth to beam data home. But New Horizons will of course be peering intently at Pluto during and immediately after the flyby. While some images will come down to mission control during this time, high-volume transmission of closest-approach data likely won't begin until early August, Stern said, and will continue for more than a year. \"From a scientific standpoint, this is going to look a lot like an orbiter mission ,\" he said. \"The spacecraft is long gone from Pluto, but new data is raining down every week, and every month, for 16 months.\" The Pluto flyby may not end New Horizons' scientific work in the dark depths of the outer solar system: Stern and his team want to send the probe on to observe another Kuiper Belt object, and they've already identified two good candidates. If NASA funds this extended mission, New Horizons would reach its second and final target in 2019.

The fastest spacecraft ever launched, New Horizons awoke from its final hibernation period in early December. Since then, the mission's science, engineering and spacecraft operations teams have configured the piano-sized probe for distant observations of the Pluto system, starting with a long-range photo shoot that begins Jan. 25. Snapped by New Horizons' telescopic Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager, known as LORRI, those pictures will give mission scientists a continually improving look at the dynamics of those moons. And they'll play a critical role in navigating the spacecraft as it covers the remaining 135 million miles (220 million kilometers) to Pluto. \"We've completed the longest journey any craft has flown from Earth to reach its primary target, and we are ready to begin exploring!\" said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Over the next few months, LORRI will take hundreds of pictures of Pluto against star fields to refine the team's estimates of New Horizons' distance to Pluto. Though the Pluto system will resemble little more than bright dots in the camera's view until May, mission navigators will use those data to design course-correction maneuvers that aim the spacecraft toward its flyby target point this summer. The first such maneuver could occur as early as March. \"We need to refine our knowledge of where Pluto will be when New Horizons flies past it,\" said Mark Holdridge, the New Horizons encounter mission manager from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. \"The flyby timing also has to be exact, because the computer commands that will orient the spacecraft and point the science instruments are based on precisely knowing the time we pass Pluto - which these images will help us determine.\" Spacecraft operators also track New Horizons using radio signals from NASA's Deep Space Network. But the \"optical navigation\" campaign that begins this month marks the first time pictures from New Horizons will be used to help pinpoint Pluto's location. This first approach phase, which lasts until spring, also includes a significant degree of other science. New Horizons will take essentially continuous data on the interplanetary environment where the Pluto system orbits, with its two charged-particle sensors measuring the high-energy particles streaming from the Sun, and its dust counter tallying dust-particle concentrations in the inner reaches of the Kuiper Belt - the unexplored outer region of the solar system that includes Pluto and potentially thousands of similar icy, rocky small planets. More intensive Pluto studies begin in the spring, when the cameras and spectrometers aboard New Horizons can provide resolutions better than the most powerful telescopes on Earth. Eventually, New Horizons will obtain images good enough to map Pluto and its moons better than has ever been achieved by any previous first planetary reconnaissance mission. APL manages the New Horizons mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), headquartered in San Antonio, is the principal investigator and leads the mission.

The New Horizons spacecraft has travelled 5bn km (3bn miles) over nine years to get near the dwarf planet. And with 200m km still to go, its images of Pluto will show only a speck of light against the stars. But the data will be critical in helping to align the probe properly for what will be just a fleeting fly-by. Pluto will be photographed repeatedly during the approach, to determine the probe's position relative to the dwarf planet, explained Mark Holdridge, from the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL) in Baltimore. \"We then perform a number of correction manoeuvres to realign our trajectory with the reference trajectory, thus ensuring we hit our aim point to travel through the Pluto system,\" he said. Any initial correction is likely to be made in March. When New Horizons arrives at Pluto it will be moving so fast - at almost 14km/s - that going into orbit around the distant world is impossible; it must barrel straight through instead. One complication is that the seven different instruments aboard the spacecraft need to work at different distances to get their data, and so the team has constructed a very elaborate observation schedule for them all. But what this means is that very precise timing will be required to make sure the flyby runs smoothly. The closest approach to Pluto is set for around 11:50 GMT on 14 July - at a miss distance of roughly 13,695km from the surface. Mission planners want the exact timings nailed to within 100 seconds. New Horizons will know then where and when to point the instruments. The Pluto mission is being billed as the last great encounter in planetary exploration. For people who grew up with the idea that there were \"nine planets\", this is the moment they get to complete the set. Robotic probes have been to all the others, even the distant Uranus and Neptune. Pluto is the last of the \"classical nine\" to receive a visit. Of course, this 2,300km-wide ice-covered rock was demoted in 2006 to the status of mere \"dwarf planet\", but scientists say that should not dull our enthusiasm. The dwarfs are the most numerous planetary class in the Solar System, and Nasa's New Horizons probe is one of the first opportunities to study an example up close. The first set of navigation pictures may not be anything special, but by May, the probe will be returning views of Pluto that are better than anything from Hubble. Come July, the view should be spectacular, said Andy Cheng, the principal investigator on the probe's main camera, which is called LORRI. \"The most recent surprise we had was with the Rosetta mission. Hubble had made a 'shape model' of Comet 67P but no-one expected it to look like a rubber duckie,\" he told BBC News. \"I am more than hopeful that we will get similar surprises with New Horizons - it's what we should expect.\" Those surprises could include yet more moons (five are currently known) and possibly even rings like those seen around some of the bigger planets. Pluto is currently 5bn km from Earth. It has taken New Horizons more than nine years to get to the dwarf's doorstep. Once the flyby is complete, the probe will be targeted at an even more distant object in the Kuiper Belt - the name given to the icy domain beyond the main planets. Scientists think this region of space, and beyond, may contain many thousands of Pluto-like objects. Some even speculate there are far-flung worlds that rival Mars and Earth in size. The first optical navigation images should be back on Earth by Tuesday at the latest. They will show Pluto with its largest moon, Charon.

The New Horizons probe, which will zoom through the Pluto system on July 14, fired its engines for 93 seconds on Tuesday, when it was about 3 billion miles from Earth. No spacecraft had ever conducted an engine burn at so great a distance from its handlers, New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern said. \"Today's engine burn by New Horizons set an ALL TIME record for the most distant by ANY spacecraft in history!\" Stern, who's based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, tweeted Tuesday via the account @NewHorizons2015. \"We set another ALL TIME record today too - 1 AU to Pluto - closer now than the sun is to Earth!\" Stern added in another tweet. Tuesday's engine burn was designed to slow New Horizons down by about 2.55 mph. The probe is currently traveling about 32,400 mph, mission officials said. The burn was the first maneuver of New Horizons' Pluto approach phase, which began in January. The trajectory correction should delay the spacecraft's arrival in the Pluto system by 14 minutes and 30 seconds. \"It will also shift the course 'sideways' by 3,442 kilometers by July 14, sending the spacecraft toward a desired flyby close-approach target point,\" mission officials wrote in an update. \"The shift was based on the latest orbit predictions of Pluto and its largest moon Charon, estimated from various sources, including optical-navigation images of the Pluto system taken by New Horizons in January and February.\" The $700 million New Horizons mission launched in January 2006, tasked with returning the first-ever good look at Pluto and its five known moons.

New Horizons will use seven different science instruments to map Pluto and Charon, study the geology of the two objects, characterize Pluto's atmosphere, hunt for additional satellites in the system and address a number of other questions. The spacecraft will come within about 8,500 miles of Pluto's surface at its closest approach on July 14. But New Horizons won't linger; it will zoom right past Pluto, speeding out farther into the Kuiper Belt, the ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit.

This is a big deal. Even though Pluto seems very familiar to us, we know far less about it than about any of the planets in our solar system. Two of its moons, Kerberos and Styx, have actually been discovered in the time since New Horizons left Earth in 2006. In the 1960s and '70s, the Mariner missions showed us Mars, Venus, and Mercury, and in the 1970s and '80s the Pioneer and Voyager missions showed us Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. In much the same way, this summer, New Horizons will give us a close-up view of Pluto for the first time.

Pluto was still a planet when New Horizons was launched on its historic mission in 2006. The mission will help fill in all the blanks about this odd-ball world with its weird orbit and swarm of moons. \"This is raw exploration, and I'm looking forward to being surprised,\" says the mission's lead scientist, Dr Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder Colorado. \"We've not only never been to the Pluto system, we've never been to this new third class of planets out in the Kuiper Belt a ring of frozen debris and comets orbiting the Sun beyond Neptune. On July 14 the small washing machine-sized craft will fly 12,500 kilometres above Pluto's unexplored surface giving us the best view yet of the dwarf planet. Until now, all we've known about Pluto has come from fuzzy images from the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observatories. \"The very best images ever made by any telescope on Earth or in Earth orbit were made by the Hubble, but they're only five pixels across. \"If you pixelate the Earth to that resolution you can't even find the continents, you can't tell that there are continents and oceans in a picture like that. \"We're going to bring the imagery to a point that we can bring out football fields on the surface of Pluto with New Horizons.\" # What will it study? The mission will help us understand how Pluto and the Kuiper Belt formed, and how that fits in with the early evolution of the solar system. \"New Horizons is carrying the most powerful set of cameras and spectrometers and other instruments ever brought to bear on the first reconnaissance of a new system like this,\" says Stern. He says the spacecraft will study the atmospheres, surface features, geology and environments of Pluto, its many moons, and other Kuiper Belt objects. It will also study Pluto's atmosphere and search for an atmosphere around its moon Charon. New Horizons will also search for rings and additional moons around Pluto. # The mission so far Zipping through the solar system at 53,000 kilometres per hour, New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched. When it blasted off on January 19, 2006, it took just 19 hours to reach the orbit of the Moon - it took the Apollo astronauts three days to fly to the Moon. From there it flew past Jupiter to take advantage of the giant planet's immense gravity, ramping up its velocity to 83,000 kilometres per hour and flinging it out beyond Neptune. The Jupiter encounter was a dress rehearsal for the main event, says Stern. \"It really was a shakedown cruise because Jupiter really was the only thing we passed along the way,\" he says. In April this year, New Horizons sent back its first colour images. # Where are we now? After a journey of over nine years and four months New Horizons is finally approaching Pluto. 'We are 99 per cent of the way there,\" says Stern. And already the science is well underway. \"Our telescopic imager ... has detected what appears to be a polar cap at the north pole of Pluto. \"We are now looking for new moons, we can see additional surface details, and we are beginning to train our spectrometers to study Pluto's atmosphere and its surface composition. \"Of course it reaches a crescendo around the 14th of July when we're in the heart of the system and flying through it.\" After visiting Pluto and its moons, New Horizons will continue exploring the Kuiper Belt. At this stage, the team are interested in two 50-kilometre-wide objects, known as PT1 and PT3, which were found by Hubble. \"We have to choose between them because they're in different directions,\" says Stern. Unfortunately PT2 doesn't get a look-in. \"PT2 was an early good candidate but as we studied its orbit more we found out that it was just a bit beyond our fuel supply,\" says Stern. Hubble is still searching for more potential targets for New Horizons to explore. \"We're just fastening our seat belt, we're along for the ride, and we're going to see what we discover,\" says Stern. \"All the early space missions 50 years ago, 40 years ago, the first to Mars, the first to Venus, the first to Mercury and Jupiter and so forth made enormous unanticipated discoveries. \"The big lesson of these first-time missions is to expect the unexpected.\" Pluto vs the planets Pluto was discovered in 1930. It was classified as a planet until August 2006 when it was demoted to a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union.+ It is tiny! With a diameter of 2322 kilometres, it is about a sixth of the size of Earth. It is tilted at 120 degrees and rotates on its side like Uranus. At the moment its north pole is facing the Sun.+ It takes 248 Earth years to orbit the Sun. Its orbit is highly elongated and tilted compared to the traditional planets -- so much so that it was closer to the Sun than Neptune between 1979 and 1999. It has a surface temperature of minus 230 degrees Celsius, and a thin atmosphere that freezes onto the ground in winter and turns back into a gas in summer.Both the atmosphere and surface of Pluto is made up of mostly nitrogen, with trace amounts of methane and carbon dioxide. It has five known moons. The largest moon Charon doesn't orbit around Pluto like the Moon orbits Earth, instead they orbit each other around a common centre of gravity.

First, new color images show a series of spots along the dwarf planet's equator. The evenly-spaced spots are about 300 miles in diameter, or about the size of the state of Missouri. Due to the spacing and size, scientists are unable to determine their origin for the time being, but that could change as New Horizons moves in for a closer look. Another thing researchers will be looking for as the spacecraft makes its approach? Clouds. Should Pluto have them, they can be used to track the speed and direction of the planet's winds. Finally, researchers using telescopes on the ground and NASA's SOFIA airborne observatory confirmed that Pluto's atmosphere didn't freeze. For years, it was believed that the planet's atmosphere would freeze onto the surface and disappear before it could be closely examined. Using the Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation instrument, New Horizons is already gathering data on the environment around the planet. The tech is designed to relay data to scientists on the ground info about Pluto's escaping atmosphere by detecting ions. With those details, it can also be determined how quickly the atmosphere is escaping.

The 14 July fly-by will take place on the 50th anniversary of Mariner 4's visit to Mars, which was America's first successful planetary fly-by. New Horizons was launched on 19 January 2006, and has been travelling through space for the past nine years. Just over a year after launch, it passed Jupiter and used the giant world's gravity to boost its velocity, as well as making scientific observations. This boost shortened the time to reach Pluto by years but last weekend, just 10 days before the encounter, the mission was suddenly cast into doubt. Contact was lost with the spacecraft for about 90 minutes. When communications were established, ground controllers found the spacecraft had entered \"safe mode\", a low-power sleep designed to protect the spacecraft when something goes wrong. The problem was diagnosed as an operator error, in which the ground staff had asked the spacecraft to do too many things at once, crashing the onboard computer. This will not happen during the fly-by itself, and science operations resumed on 7 July. At closest approach, New Horizons will be less than 12,500km above the dwarf planet's icy surface, but 4.5bn kilometres from Earth.

New Horizons has now confirmed that Pluto's radius is 1185 kilometres, plus or minus 10 kilometres, making it the largest object in the Kuiper belt, the zone on the edge of the solar system. That puts to rest a question first raised with the discovery of Eris, another large Kuiper belt object whose discovery in 2005 was partly responsible for Pluto's downgrade from planet to dwarf planet status a year later. This new radius will help us figure out how Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, formed, and provide a clearer picture of Pluto's atmosphere. In fact, New Horizons already has a new bead on Pluto's atmosphere. The probe detected ionised nitrogen streaming off the dwarf planet five days before closest approach. That surprised the team, because the probe wasn't expected to pick up such traces until 24 to 36 hours out. Further study will determine whether the nitrogen levels are stronger than predicted, or if there is another reason for the early signal. Finally, the team has confirmed that hints of an ice cap at Pluto's pole weren't just in their imagination&colon; spectroscopy measurements show it really is ice. Now they are looking for signs of a similar ice cap on Charon. There will be a whole lot more to come in the next few days.

That's the pace of the fly-by.\" ", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27889-pluto-looms-large-a-day-before-new-horizonss-closest-approach/"}, {"title": "New Horizons is an old spacecraft - but it will transform our knowledge of Pluto", "date": "2015-07-13", "content": "After travelling for nearly 10 years, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is finally set to fly past Pluto in humankind's first close encounter with the dwarf planet. But the spacecraft is at least a decade old. If it had been built with today's technology, New Horizons could have been able to send back a lot more data a lot faster. So how do space scientists cope with using old technology to make new discoveries and how will it affect the science they can do? The search for Pluto began in 1906 when Percival Lowell started a project to find a ninth planet. Unfortunately, he died just ten years later, but the search was eventually continued by Clyde Tombaugh who found the first indications of the planet on 18 February 1930, when he noticed a tiny speck of light moving between two pictures taken in January that year. New Horizons is actually carrying Tombaug's ashes aboard, on his request. Some 60 years after this discovery, a group of scientists started to work getting a spacecraft to Pluto and its moon Charon. This was being done at a time when we didn't know about its four additional companions, the moons Nix and Hydra, and Kerberos and Styx. We also didn't know that Pluto had an atmosphere. Various ideas were developed, from Pluto 350, which was a small spacecraft with only four instruments, to a large and highly capable spacecraft similar to Cassini, which is exploring Saturn and its surroundings. Ultimately these ideas didn't get beyond the design phase. But the race was on. By the late 1990s astronomers knew about Pluto's atmosphere and believed it would freeze onto the surface before 2020 as Pluto moved away from the Sun. So in order to be able to study Pluto's atmosphere it was important to get something launched quickly. Pressure from the public and the scientific community led to the selection of the New Horizons project in November 2001, which launched in January 2006. Old technology, new horizons? New Horizons, like any space mission, has different parts: the spacecraft, its scientific instruments and the equipment back at the mission base on Earth - such as the radio telescopes used to communicate with deep space missions. Obviously we can continually improve the part on the ground as technology advances. This was done to support NASA's Galileo mission to Jupiter and the Voyager mission to the giant planets. But we obviously can't go and change anything on a spacecraft to Pluto which has been in space since 2006. Spacecraft communicate with Earth by transmitting microwave signals to radio telescopes on Earth. The speed that we can receive images and other data gets slower the further away a spacecraft gets, just like being far from the telephone exchange can mean you get slower broadband at home. If a spacecraft took two minutes to transmit an image from Mars to Earth then it would take more than 10 minutes at Jupiter, 20 minutes at Saturn, and an hour at Pluto! This was a difficult problem that the designers of New Horizons had to overcome. Generally speaking, higher-frequency microwaves allow us to reduce those times. If you want to map the entire surface of Pluto this is very important. At the birth of the space age, missions such as Mariner 4 which flew past Mars in 1964 used \" S-band\", which is a frequency between 2 and 4 GHz. More than a decade later Voyager used the higher frequency \" X-band \", between 8 and 12 GHz, allowing Voyager to return much more data than Mariner. Most spacecraft still use X-band but there is a move to use higher frequencies and NASA launched its first mission using \" Ka- band \", 27-40 GHz, in 2009, just two years after New Horizons was launched. If New Horizons had been able to use Ka-band it would have potentially been able to return much more data, or return a similar amount of data more quickly than the year it will take to send back all the measurements made at Pluto. But this might not have led to such large improvements. The design of spacecraft is not straightforward. One small change in a particular area can affect the entire spacecraft design and mission plan. As for the actual instruments it is harder to know how things could have been different. The Cassini spacecraft carries a camera known as the wide-angle camera which used a telescope that was built as a spare part for Voyager. This is a camera designed in the early 1970s, put on a spacecraft designed in the 1990s, and is still returning amazing scientific images 40 years later that continue to enable us to understand Saturn's secrets. In a similar vein, Galileo was launched in 1989 and carried an instrument to measure charged particles around Jupiter that was based on an updated instrument from Voyager, also designed in the early 1970s. So having instrumentation that is 10-15 years old doesn't appear to be a problem. Space missions are mainly restricted by costs and are designed for what they are to study. If they are overly restricted by the available technology then they usually don't get selected for launch. NASA could have spent more money on New Horizons to include more instruments, or more power to have allowed it to send back more data more quickly, but this could have resulted in a mission that was never sent in the first place or one that got there much later and missed something exciting. The main thing is that we are continuing our exploration of the solar system. Humankind is continuing a journey that started 115 years ago in an astronomical observatory in Arizona.

The radio signals were received by a Deep Space Network antenna in Spain four and a half hours after they were sent out from the spacecraft at the speed of light, and a full 13 hours after the probe made its close pass. But they electrified hundreds of VIPs, journalists and Pluto fans here at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as if the main event had just happened. The audience stood up, applauded and waved American flags as, one by one, mission controllers reported \"nominal\" status for the hardware that was their responsibility. \"We have a healthy spacecraft, we've recorded data of the Pluto system, and we're outbound from Pluto,\" mission operations manager Alice Bowman declared just before 9 p.m. ET, setting off the last and biggest round of applause. She said the procedure went \"just like we planned it, just like we practiced.\" The transmission not only assured the team that the piano-sized spacecraft was in good health, nine and a half years after its launch, but it also suggested that groundbreaking images and observations of Pluto and its moons would be streaming in from New Horizons for months to come. The flyby actually took place at 7:49 a.m. ET Tuesday, with New Horizons traveling at more than 30,000 mph and coming within 7,750 miles of the dwarf planet's mottled surface. But the spacecraft was so busy making observations that it couldn't turn its antenna back toward Earth to send the all-clear signal until hours later. To mark the occasion, NASA released a colorized view of the dwarf planet that was sent back to Earth before New Horizons went out of contact on Monday night. The picture featured the dwarf planet's bright heart-shaped region as well as the head of a dark \"whale\" feature. It was part of a \"fail-safe\" series of observations that were made just in case the spacecraft suffered a catastrophic failure during the flyby. After the image was released, mission scientists went into high gear, pointing to features in the photo such as a bright bull's-eye crater nicknamed the \"whale's blowhole,\" a point that may be a frost-capped peak, linear streaks that may hint at tectonic activity - and mounds of icy material on the surface. The mission's principal investigator, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute, was asked whether it was now fair to say that it snows on Pluto. \"It sure looks that way,\" he replied. Stern said it felt good to get through the flyby. \"It's a moment of celebration, because we've just done the 'anchor leg,'\" Stern said on NASA TV, using a track-and-field metaphor. \"We have completed the initial reconnaissance of the solar system.\" No new images were transmitted on Tuesday - just the telemetry reporting the spacecraft's health. The first images and data from the close flyby are due to be received and unveiled on Wednesday, and they'll continue coming down for the next 16 months. The mission quickly captured the popular spotlight, in forms ranging from a Google Doodle and a New Yorker cartoon, to NASA astronaut Scott Kelly's salute from the International Space Station, to a congratulatory tweet from President Barack Obama. \"It's a great day for American discovery and leadership,\" Obama wrote. John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science, said the heart of New Horizons' appeal is its status as the first mission to the last frontier - that is, the icy worlds that lie beyond the orbit of Neptune, in a region known as the Kuiper Belt. \"Pluto is kind of a capstone of our solar system exploration, and also opening up this new realm,\" he said. Among those on hand for Tuesday night's \"Phone Home\" celebration were the children of late astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930; the daughter of the late astronomer Gerard Kuiper, after whom the Kuiper Belt is named; Jim Christy, the discoverer of Charon, Pluto's largest moon; and a group of 9-year-old children who were born on the day of New Horizons' launch. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden was on hand as well, and hailed the flyby as a demonstration of \"how great our nation is.\" Intentionally or not, he also touched on the controversy over the International Astronomical Union's classification of Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" rather than a full-fledged planet in 2006, just months after New Horizons was launched. \"With this mission, we have visited every single planet in our solar system,\" Bolden said. He didn't include the \"dwarf\" label.

This frozen region is north of Pluto's icy mountains, in the center-left of the heart feature, informally named \"Tombaugh Regio\" after Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930. \"This terrain is not easy to explain,\" said Jeff Moore, leader of the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics, and Imaging Team at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. \"The discovery of vast, craterless, very young plains on Pluto exceeds all pre-flyby expectations.\" This fascinating icy plains region-resembling frozen mud cracks on Earth-has been informally named \"Sputnik Planum\" after the Earth's first artificial satellite. It has a broken surface of irregularly-shaped segments, roughly 12 miles across, bordered by what appear to be shallow troughs. Some of these troughs have darker material within them, while others are traced by clumps of hills that appear to rise above the surrounding terrain. Elsewhere, the surface appears to be etched by fields of small pits that may have formed by a process called sublimation, in which ice turns directly from solid to gas, just as dry ice does on Earth. Scientists have two working theories as to how these segments were formed. The irregular shapes may be the result of the contraction of surface materials, similar to what happens when mud dries. Alternatively, they may be a product of convection, similar to wax rising in a lava lamp. On Pluto, convection would occur within a surface layer of frozen carbon monoxide, methane, and nitrogen, driven by the scant warmth of Pluto's interior. Pluto's icy plain also displays dark streaks that are a few miles long. These streaks appear to be aligned in the same direction and may have been produced by winds blowing across the frozen surface. The \"heart of the heart\" image was taken Tuesday when New Horizons was 48,000 miles from Pluto and shows features as small as one-half mile across. Mission scientists will learn more about these mysterious terrains from higher-resolution and stereo images that New Horizons will pull from its digital recorders and send back to Earth during the next year. The New Horizons Atmospheres team observed Pluto's atmosphere as far as 1,000 miles above the surface, demonstrating that Pluto's nitrogen-rich atmosphere is quite extended. This is the first observation of Pluto's atmosphere at altitudes higher than 170 miles above the surface. The New Horizons Particles and Plasma team has discovered a region of cold, dense ionized gas tens of thousands of miles beyond Pluto-the planet's atmosphere being stripped away by the solar wind and lost to space. \"With the flyby in the rearview mirror, a decade-long journey to Pluto is over, but the science payoff is only beginning,\" said Jim Green, director of Planetary Science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Data from New Horizons will continue to fuel discovery for years to come.\" Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, added: \"We've only scratched the surface of our Pluto exploration, but it already seems clear to me that in the initial reconnaissance of the solar system, the best was saved for last.\" New Horizons is part of NASA's New Frontiers Program, managed by the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

New Horizons zoomed within 7,800 miles of Pluto's surface on July 14, capturing the first up-close images of the dwarf planet and its moons. Though the spacecraft is now speeding away from Pluto into the depths of the frigid and faraway Kuiper Belt, it's still gathering data and beaming information home to Earth. \"We're now in the first of our 'departure science' command loads,\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said during a press briefing Friday. \"So we're looking back at the planet in that special geometry, looking at the night side and doing various experiments, and splitting our time downlinking data,\" Stern added. New Horizons will operate in three separate \"departure phases\" that last until January 2016, when the mission's Pluto encounter officially ends. But data delivery to Earth will continue far beyond that date, because downlink rates are so slow - about 2 kilobits per second - and the probe has gathered so much information about the dwarf planet system. of data-receiving antennas with other missions.) New Horizons collected about 50 gigabits of data during its nine-day-long \"close-approach\" phase of operations, which ended Thursday. As of Friday, less than 2 percent of that information had come down to the ground, Stern said. New Horizons is initially sending home compressed versions of its data files, to get them back to Earth relatively quickly. A concerted effort to get all the flyby data down in compressed form will begin in September and should take 10 to 12 weeks, Stern said. The complete dataset of uncompressed files, meanwhile, should be on the ground by late 2016, NASA officials have said. But that milestone may not mark the end of New Horizons' work, either. Stern and the rest of the team would like to send the spacecraft on to study another Kuiper Belt object up close during an extended mission, and they've already identified two potential targets for this second flyby, which would likely occur in early 2019. Both bodies - named 2014 MU69 and 2014 PN70 - lie about 1 billion miles beyond Pluto, which is nearly 3 billion miles from Earth at the moment. 2014 MU69 and 2014 MT70 are both several dozen miles wide, so they're very different objects than Pluto, which New Horizons revealed to be 1,473 miles in diameter. A decision on which body to fly by will be made soon; minimizing the fuel needed to get to New Horizons' next target requires firing up the engines by this fall, mission team members have said. That engine burn will therefore probably be performed before NASA officially approves and funds the potential extended mission. \"The proposal to explore additional KBOs will be due in 2016; it will be evaluated by an independent team of experts to gauge its merit: the team will evaluate the health of the spacecraft and its instrument payload, the value of the science New Horizons can do at a KBO, the cost of the flight to and the exploration of the target KBO, and more,\" New Horizons team members wrote in a description of the mission's timeline. \"If it recommends funding and NASA approves, the New Horizons Extended Mission would begin in 2017, allowing the team to plan and test the encounter and to continue to operate New Horizons,\" they added.

The latest curiosity: A photo showing a snakeskin-like texture on the surface of the dwarf planet. \"It's a unique and perplexing landscape stretching over hundreds of miles. It looks more like tree bark or dragon scales than geology,\" William McKinnon, who works on the geology, geophysics and imaging team for New Horizons, said in a statement. He speculated the unique area captured in the photo could be \"some combination of internal tectonic forces and ice sublimation driven by Pluto's faint sunlight.\" New Horizons is in the process of sending a trove of data and photos back to Earth. With data downlinking at a rate of approximately 1 to 4 kilobits per second, it's expected the entire trove of science from the July 14 flyby will take one year to be transmitted back to Earth. Launched in January 2006 on a 3-billion-mile journey to Pluto, New Horizons \"phoned home\" after its Pluto flyby, indicating that it had successfully navigated just 7,700 miles from the dwarf planet. It later sent back the first high-resolution images of Pluto's surface. New Horizons conserved energy by taking \"naps\" during the monumental trip. The spacecraft, equipped with a battery that converts radiation from decaying plutonium into electricity, may have enough power for two more decades of exploration, according to NASA. The piano-sized probe is currently speeding through the Kuiper Belt, an area at the edge of the solar system encompassing Pluto and a vast area of tiny, icy worlds. After the intensive data transmission process, NASA is considering another flyby of a Kuiper belt object known as 2014 MU69 that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto. New Horizons loses about a few watts of power each year, according to NASA, but is estimated to have as much as 20 years left in its life expectancy.

The haze particles themselves are likely gray or red, but the way they scatter blue light has gotten the attention of the New Horizons science team. \"That striking blue tint tells us about the size and composition of the haze particles,\" said science team researcher Carly Howett, also of SwRI. \"A blue sky often results from scattering of sunlight by very small particles. On Earth, those particles are very tiny nitrogen molecules. On Pluto they appear to be larger - but still relatively small - soot-like particles we call tholins.\" Scientists believe the tholin particles form high in the atmosphere, where ultraviolet sunlight breaks apart and ionizes nitrogen and methane molecules and allows them to react with one another to form more and more complex negatively and positively charged ions. When they recombine, they form very complex macromolecules, a process first found to occur in the upper atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan. The more complex molecules continue to combine and grow until they become small particles; volatile gases condense and coat their surfaces with ice frost before they have time to fall through the atmosphere to the surface, where they add to Pluto's red coloring.

This ancient body in the Kuiper Belt is more than a billion miles beyond Pluto; New Horizons will explore it if NASA approves an extended mission. The four propulsive manoeuvres were the most distant trajectory corrections ever performed by any spacecraft. The fourth manoeuvre, programmed into the spacecraft's computers and executed with New Horizons' hydrazine-fueled thrusters, started at approximately 1:15pm EST on Wednesday, 4 November, and lasted just under 20 minutes. Spacecraft operators at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, began receiving data through NASA's Deep Space Network just before 7pm EST Wednesday indicating the final targeting manoeuvre went as planned. The manoeuvres didn't speed or slow the spacecraft as much as they \"pushed\" New Horizons sideways, giving it a 57 metre per second nudge toward the KBO. That's enough to make New Horizons intercept MU69 in just over three years. \"This is another milestone in the life of an already successful mission that's returning exciting new data every day,\" said Curt Niebur, New Horizons program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"These course adjustments preserve the option of studying an even more distant object in the future, as New Horizons continues its remarkable journey.\" The New Horizons team will submit a formal proposal to NASA for the extended mission to 2014 MU69 in early 2016. The science team hopes to explore even closer to MU69 than New Horizons came to Pluto on 14 July, which was approximately 7,750 miles. \"New Horizons is healthy and now on course to make the first exploration of a building block of small planets like Pluto, and we're excited to propose its exploration to NASA,\" said New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. The KBO targeting manoeuvres were the mission's largest and longest, and carried out in a succession faster than any sequence of previous New Horizons engine burns. They were also incredibly accurate, performing almost exactly as they were designed and setting New Horizons on the course mission designers predicted. \"The performance of each manoeuvre was spot on,\" said APL's Gabe Rogers, New Horizons spacecraft systems engineer and guidance and control lead. The first three manoeuvres were carried out on 22, 25 and 28 October. At the time of yesterday's manoeuvre, New Horizons, speeding toward deeper space at more than 32,000 miles per hour, was approximately 84 million miles beyond Pluto and nearly 3.2 billion miles from Earth.

The results of an initial analysis of the data returned to date from the spacecraft, presented during sessions of the annual conference of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Science here Nov. 9, include the discovery of possible ice volcanoes on the surface of Pluto and an atmosphere colder and more compact than previously expected. \"Pluto and its system of satellites has really outsmarted us,\" said Alan Stern, principal investigator of the New Horizons mission, during a press conference about some of the results presented at the conference. The surprises scientists have discovered about the distant world, he said, stem from a \"vast variety of landforms\" seen on its surface and evidence for changes to it over time. One of the major findings presented at the conference was the discovery of a pair of mountains, informally named Wright Mons and Piccard Mons. The shapes of the mountains, and the presence of depressions at the summits, suggest to scientists that they are volcanoes that would erupt ice, rather than molten rock. \"Nothing like this has ever been seen in the outer part of the solar system,\" said Oliver White of NASA's Ames Research Center. If that explanation is correct, he said, \"that would be one of the most phenomenal discoveries of New Horizons and make Pluto an even more fascinating and unique place.\" Other results from the conference showed that Pluto's tenuous atmosphere - its surface pressure is only ten millionths that of the Earth's atmosphere - is colder and more compact than initially expected. That suggests that far less of the atmosphere is escaping to space than expected. \"This changes our thinking of the long-term evolution of Pluto and its atmosphere,\" said Leslie Young of the Southwest Research Institute. That includes losing far less of the ice on Pluto's surface than originally thought. \"The atmosphere has some huge implications for the history of the geology of Pluto.\" The DPS conference is the first scientific meeting where scientists involved with New Horizons have presented results since July's flyby. \"That is the milestone that really marks the beginning of the scientific process,\" said Curt Niebur, a program scientist working in the planetary sciences division of NASA Headquarters. \"This is when the debates begin.\" However, that debate of the findings was initially limited to the people attending the meeting. Attendees of the morning conference sessions Nov. 9 were told that the results were embargoed until a midday press conference. This prevented both scientists and reporters from sharing the results presented in those talks to the public, including through social media, much to the consternation of some in attendance. Sources at the conference blamed the embargo on NASA, in contrary to the conference embargo policy established for conferences run by the American Astronomical Society. Niebur said later that the embargo was a misunderstanding that won't apply to other sessions during the week-long conference. \"There was some kind of miscommunication,\" he said. \"There was a little bit of organizational confusion.\" Members of the mission team emphasized that the results are still preliminary, based on just the small fraction of the data returned to date. Stern said only about 20 percent of the flyby data has been transmitted so far, given the spacecraft's distance from the Earth and access to the Deep Space Network. It will take about a year to transmit the remaining data. \"You can either be frustrated that the data is not on the ground, or you can just look of it as new presents landing every week,\" said Stern. And, with only that preliminary data, some scientists were cautious about making many conclusions. John Spencer of the Southwest Research Institute, in a talk about searches for small moons and dust surrounding Pluto, decided not to discuss any implications of the findings to date. \"We have no idea what any of this means at this point,\" he said.

New Horizons Offers New Clues", "date": "2016-01-07", "content": " When NASA's New Horizons spacecraft reached Pluto last July, it gave scientists their first detailed look at one of the most mysterious objects in the solar system. In addition to wonders like soaring mountains, ice volcanoes and a giant heart-shaped basin, images beamed back by the probe revealed a surface marred by a network of fissures and a notably spherical shape. For some scientists, those last two discoveries are hints that something even wilder may be hidden inside the tiny world, because they are the first direct clues that Pluto could host a subsurface ocean beneath its thick, icy crust. If confirmed, an ocean on Pluto would have profound implications, because it would increase the likelihood that other icy bodies could host liquid water-and possibly life. \"The fact that even cold, distant Pluto could have a subsurface ocean means that there are potential habitats even in apparently unpromising locations,\" says Francis Nimmo, a New Horizons scientist based at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Aside from Earth, no bodies in the solar system have large amounts of liquid water on their surfaces. That's a bummer for astrobiologists, as most scientists believe that water is a necessary ingredient for life to arise. Still, space probes have been collecting evidence for decades that icy moons around Jupiter and Saturn hold vast oceans beneath their crusts. Saturn's moon Enceladus spews geysers that are tantalizingly rich with water and carbon, while Jupiter's Europa is covered in fractures and ridges that hint at a subsurface ocean melting through the ice. These worlds are currently considered some of the best places to look for life elsewhere in the solar system. Pluto is similarly icy, but the difference is that those moons have more obvious sources of heat to keep internal water liquid: the gravitational kneading they receive as they swing around their massive parent planets. Pluto has no massive companion and orbits between 3 and 5 billion miles from the sun, so astronomers mostly thought it must be too cold for a modern ocean. Some theoretical models suggested that radioactive decay in Pluto's rocky interior could heat things up enough to create a subsurface ocean at some point in its history, maybe even enough heat that waters persist today, but there was no real evidence, says Nimmo-until now. Speaking at a recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, Nimmo outlined two key clues from New Horizons. Neither one alone is a slam dunk, he says, but together, they're suggestive. First, New Horizons revealed the presence of extensional tectonics, faults and fissures across the face of Pluto that could indicate the surface has undergone expansion in the recent past. \"An easy way of doing that is if you have an ocean that's starting to refreeze,\" Nimmo says, because water expands in volume as it changes from a liquid to a solid. \"As the liquid water freezes back into ice, the outer surface of Pluto has to move outward, and you get expansion.\" The second piece of evidence has to do with Pluto's shape, in particular, the notable lack of a bulge around its equator like the one found on Earth, its moon and other rounded celestial bodies. As spherical bodies spin, the rotational forces push material toward the equator, flattening them out somewhat. The moon's equatorial bulge is even greater than it should be given its current rotation rate, and scientists think that's because it was spinning faster earlier in its history, when lunar rock was more ductile. By contrast, although Pluto is spinning faster than our moon, it has no bulge at all. \"The moon is recording an ancient spin state,\" Nimmo says. \"Pluto shows no evidence of that. There are different ways of destroying a fossil bulge, and one of them is to have an ocean.\" That's because water has more freedom of motion than ice, so a global liquid layer sloshing around inside would help counteract the spinning forces, reducing such a bulge. So far, the New Horizons team is making a pretty solid case for an ocean on Pluto, says Amy Barr Mlinar, an expert in the formation and evolution of solid planetary bodies at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona. \"It's based on a basic planetary-science type of analysis. It doesn't require a lot of fancy modeling where there are 45 different input parameters that can be messed up,\" says Barr Mlinar. But not everyone is convinced just yet, even other members of the New Horizons team. Pluto's surface cracks could be explained by other internal changes in the ice's temperature or structure, says Bill McKinnon, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. \"Likewise, the collapse of a fossil bulge is consistent with an ocean on Pluto,\" McKinnon says. \"But an ocean is not required. Nor does it mean the ocean, even if it did exist, has to exist today. The collapse of the fossil bulge could have occurred billions of years ago.\" New Horizons performed a single flyby of Pluto. For more concrete proof of Pluto's ocean, \"we would need to go back with an orbiter mission, maybe later in this century,\" McKinnon says. If future tests do confirm the presence of an ocean on Pluto, McKinnon thinks there could be even more hidden seas waiting to be discovered in the fringes of the solar system. Pluto is part of the Kuiper belt, a ring of similar bodies that could also be generating internal heat from radioactive decay. \"Other large Kuiper belt objects are similarly or even more rock-rich, so these worlds could also have oceans,\" he says. Such distant oceans would be very different from what we're accustomed to on Earth, notes Nadine Barlow, an astronomer at Northern Arizona University. Besides being locked beneath dozens of feet of ice, a Plutonian ocean would almost certainly have a different composition than Earth's seas. \"We have to remember that the ices out at Pluto not only include water ice but also carbon dioxide and methane ices,\" says Barlow. Compared to our seas, Pluto's potential ocean would also likely be especially briny, rich in dissolved salts and ammonia that would help reduce its freezing point and keep it in a liquid state. Those extra ingredients would make Pluto's seawater unappealing to astronauts, but it's still possible some forms of extreme life could call such an ocean home. And while New Horizons has already sped away from Pluto towards its next Kuiper belt target, NASA's planned mission to the Jovian moon Europa might be a crucial testing ground for studying subsurface oceans on icy bodies and determining their feasibility for hosting life. That means the Europa mission and any future treks to explore Pluto will need to take precautions so as not to contaminate any potentially life-supporting environments with terrestrial organisms, says Barlow. Barr Mlinar agrees: \"We may have to think of clever ways to explore the chemistry of Pluto's ocean from the surface,\" she says. \"We have to learn more about the geology of these bodies and how material from the ocean can be expressed on the surface.\" ", "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/does-icy-pluto-have-hidden-ocean-new-horizons-offers-new-clues-180957737/"}, {"title": "New Horizons reveals Pluto's widespread water ice", "date": "2016-01-29", "content": "Data from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft point to more prevalent water ice on Pluto's surface than previously thought. A new false-colour image, derived from observations in infrared light by the Ralph/Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array instrument, shows where the spectral features of water ice are abundant on Pluto's surface. It is based on two LEISA scans of Pluto obtained on 14 July 2015, from a range of about 67,000 miles. The scans, taken about 15 minutes apart, were stitched into a combined multispectral Pluto \"data cube\" covering the full hemisphere visible to New Horizons as it flew past Pluto. A data cube like this is a three-dimensional array in which an image of Pluto is formed at each LEISA-sensitive wavelength. Water ice is Pluto's crustal \"bedrock,\" the canvas on which its more volatile ices paint their seasonally changing patterns. Initial New Horizons maps of Pluto's water ice bedrock compared LEISA spectra with a pure water ice template spectrum, resulting in the map at left. A disadvantage of that technique is that water ice's spectral signature is easily masked by methane ice, so that map was only sensitive to areas that were especially rich in water ice and/or depleted in methane. The much more sensitive method used on the right involves modelling the contributions of Pluto's various ices all together. This method, too, has limitations in that it can only map ices included in the model, but the team is continually adding more data and improving the model. The new map shows exposed water ice to be considerably more widespread across Pluto's surface than was previously known - an important discovery. But despite its much greater sensitivity, the map still shows little or no water ice in the informally named places called Sputnik Planum and Lowell Regio. This indicates that at least in these regions, Pluto's icy bedrock is well hidden beneath a thick blanket of other ices such as methane, nitrogen and carbon monoxide.

If you were to time it so that the Sun was right behind Pluto during your flyby, you'd see an amazing phenomenon - the haze in Pluto's nitrogen atmosphere varies in brightness, creating a flaring effect that almost makes it look like the surface of the dwarf planet is rippling. We know this because NASA's New Horizons probe was privileged to witness this very spectacle when it made its flyby of the dwarf planet last year, and it captured the rippling effect in the animation you can see below. So what's going on here? According to NASA, the layers of haze that make up Pluto's primarily nitrogen-based atmosphere can vary in brightness depending on illumination and your viewpoint. But these layers maintain their overall structure in the atmosphere, so what's behind the crazy light show? New Horizons scientists think the rippling effect could be due to gravity waves - not to be confused with gravitational waves. Also known as buoyancy waves, gravity waves are an atmospheric phenomenon that occurs on Earth and Mars. They result from airflow over mountains, NASA explains : \"As the name implies, atmospheric gravity waves form when buoyancy pushes air up, and gravity pulls it back down.\" The backlit images that make up the animation you see here were taken by New Horizons' Long Range Reconnaissance Imager as the spacecraft departed Pluto on 14 July 2015. NASA says the gravity waves - if that indeed is what's causing the flaring to take place - make the brightness in the haze vary by about 30 percent. But despite the fluctuating appearance, the haze itself occupies the same space and keeps its height - extending to an altitude of around 200 kilometres above Pluto's surface. While there's still a lot we don't know about Pluto's atmosphere, we're finding out more all the time, thanks to New Horizons still transmitting data back to Earth, even though the flyby happened several months ago. And the discoveries will keep on coming, too, as the observations are expected to take a full 16 months to download in total. \"Pluto is simply amazing,\" said LORRI principal investigator Andy Cheng, from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \"When I first saw these images and the haze structures that they reveal, I knew we had a new clue to the nature of Pluto's hazes.

Known as 2014 MU69, the object is thought to be unchanged since the birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. Scientists plan to use the same cameras and other instruments that showed the world a ruddy, textured Pluto to reveal more about the building blocks of the planets, the ripple effects of the sun's energy and the boundaries of space. The team managing the mission at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel submitted plans last month to NASA to fly past the relatively tiny chunk of icy matter on New Year's Day 2019. If NASA approves it, the extended New Horizon mission could give a close-up view of what has so far only appeared to scientists as a faint dot of light. \"There's no other way to see it,\" said Kenneth R. Sembach, director of Baltimore's Space Telescope Science Institute, which helped the Hopkins scientists find the object. \"Even the largest and most powerful telescopes can't tell us about what those objects are like up close.\" The object is in a 300-year orbit around the sun in the Kuiper Belt, a region of space beyond Neptune believed to contain small bodies made largely of ice. Some of those bodies have been knocked into orbits that take them into the inner solar system, and that exposure to the sun's heat means they aren't quite as they were billions of years ago. Others, like Pluto, are close enough to Neptune that the planet influences their orbits. But 2014 MU69 is thought to be part of a third category of Kuiper Belt objects that has remained far from interactions with other bodies. It will be more than 43 times the distance between the Earth and the sun when New Horizons passes. \"These may be the most primitive objects in the solar system,\" said Hal Weaver, New Horizons project scientist at the Hopkins lab. Though New Horizons isn't the first NASA mission to venture so far from Earth, technological advancements mean it will likely reveal new discoveries. NASA's Pioneer 10, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions passed through the Kuiper Belt decades ago, but none made any close-up observations of objects. New Horizons has two cameras on board to give a detailed view of 2014 MU69, which it will come four times closer to than the 7,700-mile distance from which it observed Pluto at its closest approach. That is in part because 2014 MU69 is much smaller - probably about 18 miles across, compared with 1,500-mile-wide Pluto. \"You have less real estate to deal with,\" Weaver said. \"If you want to have hundreds of pixels across the surface and the body's only 30 kilometers across, you've got to get pretty close.\" But perhaps more illuminating will be data captured by spectrographic instruments that observe radiation to show more about the composition and characteristics of the object. If 2014 MU69 is indeed an untouched remnant of the early solar system, that information could prove groundbreaking. Other observations about the environment surrounding the object will be richer in detail than ever obtained. Both Voyager spacecrafts are still gathering data from a distance of more than 100 times the space between Earth and the sun, and there is some question whether they are seeing evidence of charged particles from the sun even in interstellar space. \"In the next few years, New Horizons is probably going to enable there to be some better understanding of that, and perhaps some paradigm shifts in how the solar system interacts with interstellar space,\" said Ralph McNutt, chief scientist in the space department at the Hopkins lab. The Hopkins team transmitted a series of maneuvers to New Horizons last fall to start guiding the spacecraft toward 2014 MU69, in case the mission is approved. And if it is, more adjustments in its trajectory might be needed. The scientists also have proposed using the Hubble Space Telescope to gather more intelligence on the object, so they can best navigate and time the fly- by. A panel of scientific experts convened by NASA will consider the extended mission proposal over the coming months. A decision is expected by fall, and the mission, if approved, would begin in 2017, said NASA spokeswoman Laurie Cantillo. The panel will weigh the proposal \"based on the value of the science New Horizons can perform at 2014 MU69 and the health of the spacecraft and its instrument payload, she said. The proposed mission would cost $80 million over five years, on top of the $700 million budget for New Horizons' primary mission. The Hopkins scientists are optimistic. The spacecraft is \"still working beautifully,\" Weaver said. Its power source, a single radioisotope thermoelectric generator, is gradually losing power but is expected to last into the 2030s. If NASA wanted to send another spacecraft to do the proposed observations, it would take a long time to catch up with New Horizons. \"It takes 30 years to put together one of these missions, and it takes 10 years to get out to this region of the solar system,\" Weaver said. \"Nothing else could do this in the next 30 years and probably 50 years.\" ", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bs-hs-new-horizons-extended-20160423-story.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "New Horizons Space Probe Gets Mission Extension", "date": "2016-07-07", "content": "The U.S. space agency has announced it is extending the mission of the New Horizons spacecraft.

New Horizons Mission Celebrates Anniversary", "date": "2016-07-14", "content": "One year ago today, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft lifted the veil on mysterious, faraway Pluto. Astronomers hadn't been able to get a good look at Pluto since its discovery in 1930; even NASA's superpowerful Hubble Space Telescope could only resolve the distant dwarf planet into a blur of pixels. But that all changed on July 14, 2015, when New Horizons performed history's first-ever flyby of Pluto, zooming within just 7,800 miles of the frigid world's surface. New Horizons' observations revealed Pluto to be a staggeringly complex and dynamic world, with towering water-ice mountains, vast plains of frozen nitrogen, surprisingly blue skies and a myriad of other intriguing features, including a huge \"heart\" that found its way onto Twitter feeds and T-shirts around the globe. The probe's images also showed that the nitrogen-ice plain, known as Sputnik Planum, harbors no detectable craters, indicating that the region has been resurfaced quite recently. This came as a huge surprise to scientists, who had not expected that a world as small as Pluto could remain geologically active without some sort of gravitational interaction with a big body. And there are undoubtedly more discoveries to come: New Horizons is still beaming flyby data home, and likely won't be done doing so for another three months, mission principal investigator Alan Stern has said. This enhanced-color image of Pluto, taken by NASA's New Horizons probe during its historic flyby on July 14, 2015, shows the dwarf planet's famous \"heart.\" The spacecraft has other science work in its future as well. Two weeks ago, NASA officially approved an extended mission for New Horizons, which will allow the probe to fly by a small object called 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019. Astronomers think 2014 MU69, which lies about 1 billion miles beyond Pluto, is just 13 to 25 miles wide. So it's a very different object than the dwarf planet Pluto, and studying it up-close should reveal new insights about the far outer solar system's formation and evolution, Stern has said. \"The capstone exploration of Pluto that completed humankind's first era of reconnaissance of the planets in our solar system is now behind us,\" Stern, who's based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, wrote in a blog post last week. \"We are very proud of how well that went and how much new knowledge resulted from it,\" he added. \"But we are also excited to explore further - another flyby a billion miles beyond Pluto - and to see what knowledge and inspiration that exploration will bring just 2.5 years from now.\" The $700 million New Horizons mission launched in January 2006. The nuclear- powered probe has plenty of juice left to take it through the 2019 flyby and beyond, mission officials have said.

The probe was the first to encounter the small world at the edge of our classical solar system, sending back images that revealed Pluto's surface for the first time. But beyond its own mission of exploration, New Horizons also served as the delivery vehicle for a 1.5-inch by 1-inch relic that set a record of its own. \"The official record for the farthest distance traveled by a postage stamp is 3.26 billion miles 5.25 billion km ,\" said Jimmy Coggins, an official adjudicator for Guinness World Records, at a ceremony held Tuesday morning at the United States Postal Service's headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"In 2006, NASA placed a 29-cent \"Pluto: Not Yet Explored\" stamp on board the New Horizons spacecraft on its way to Pluto and beyond,\" explained Jim Cochrane, USPS chief marketing and sales officer and executive vice president, in a statement. \"That historic flyby with Pluto took place last summer - July 14, 2015, to be precise - after New Horizons travelled more than three billion miles in its nine-and-a-half-year journey.\" The newly-affirmed record will extend for at least another 1 billion miles, as NASA recently announced that the New Horizons mission is journeying beyond Pluto to visit a Kuiper Belt Object known as 2014 MU69 - considered to be one of the early building blocks of the solar system. \"The New Horizons project is honored to be recognized by Guinness World Records for its achievements,\" said Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"Among my personal favorites are being the fastest spacecraft ever launched, the first mission to explore the Pluto system, the mission that explored the farthest worlds ever visited - and now sending a U.S. postage stamp farthest from Earth!\" The 29-cent stamp was issued by the U.S. Postal Service on Oct. 1, 1991 as part of a set of stamps celebrating the robotic exploration of the solar system. Designed by artist Ron Miller, the stamp's artwork was based on the very little information known about Pluto at the time and included the caption, \"Not Yet Explored.\" \"You know it says 'Not Yet Explored,' and I have to say, it was a beautiful stamp. It really inspired us when we were building New Horizons to explore this last of the classical planets,\" said Stern at Tuesday's record ceremony. \"Well, we canceled that stamp last July when we flew by Pluto.\" To mark the mission's accomplishment, the USPS issued a new set of stamps, appropriately titled \"Pluto-Explored!\" on May 31. The two stamps feature an artist's rendering of the spacecraft and an image of the dwarf planet as taken by New Horizons. This is at least the second Guinness World Record set by the New Horizons mission. In 2006, the robotic probe was recognized for achieving the fastest speed at which a craft has departed from Earth, 36,250 mph. To put that into some perspective, it took three days for the Apollo 11 spacecraft to reach the moon 47 years ago this week. New Horizons flew past the moon's orbit in just nine hours. \"When I started to look at the record, over 3 billion miles, I started thinking about the history of the Postal Service,\" said Coggins. \"At one point in the early 1800s, to deliver a letter from the east coast to the west coast of the United States, it took four to seven weeks. In the mid-1850s, with the Pony Express, they found a more direct route and it still took 10 days to get from St. Louis to San Francisco. That is about 190 miles 306 km a day.\" \"To think about this distance, 3 billion miles - that is about 131 thousand times around the circumference of the Earth and it was delivered in less than 10 years,\" Coggins said. \"If the Pony Express was trying to deliver that far, they would be swapping ponies out for the next 47,000 years before it got there.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/33478-pluto-stamp-nasa-new-horizons-world-record.html"}, {"title": "Nasa's New Horizons space probe spots possible clouds on Pluto", "date": "2016-10-19", "content": "Nasa's New Horizons space probe has spotted possible clouds hovering over Pluto, indicating that the weather on the icy dwarf planet is more complex than thought. \"We're excited about the exploration ahead for New Horizons, and also about what we are still discovering from Pluto flyby data,\" said Alan Stern, principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute in the US. \"Now, with our spacecraft transmitting the last of its data from last summer's flight through the Pluto system, we know that the next great exploration of Pluto will require another mission to be sent there,\" said Stern. Stern said that Pluto's complex, layered atmosphere is hazy and appears to be mostly free of clouds, but the team has spied a handful of potential clouds in images taken with New Horizons' cameras during its historic Pluto flyby of in July last year. \"If there are clouds, it would mean the weather on Pluto is even more complex than we imagined,\" Stern said. Scientists already knew that Pluto's icy surface below that atmosphere varied widely in brightness. Data from the flyby not only confirms that, it also shows the brightest areas are among the most reflective in the solar system. \"That brightness indicates surface activity,\" said Bonnie Buratti, a science team co-investigator from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. While Pluto shows many kinds of activity, one surface process apparently missing is landslides. However, they have been spotted on Pluto's largest moon, Charon, itself some 1,200 kilometres across. \"We've seen similar landslides on other rocky and icy planets, such as Mars and Saturn's moon Iapetus, but these are the first landslides we've seen this far from the sun, in the Kuiper Belt,\" said Ross Beyer, researcher from the SETI Institute and Nasa Ames Research Centre in California. Hubble Space Telescope data suggests that 2014 MU69, a small Kuiper Belt object about 1.6 billion kilometres beyond Pluto, is as red, if not redder, than Pluto. This is the first hint at the surface properties of the far flung object that New Horizons will survey on 1 January 2019. \"The reddish colour tells us the type of Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 is,\" said Amanda Zangari, a New Horizons post-doctoral researcher from Southwest Research Institute. \"The data confirms that on New Year's Day 2019, New Horizons will be looking at one of the ancient building blocks of the planets,\" said Zangari. The New Horizons spacecraft is currently 5.5 billion kilometres from Earth and about 540 million kilometres beyond Pluto, speeding away from the sun at about 14 km every second. New Horizons has covered about one-third of the distance from Pluto to its next flyby target, which is now about one billion kilometres ahead.", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/Science/KBLCY0im968wvbvhbmW5tO/Nasas-New-Horizons-space-probe-spots-possible-clouds-on-Plu.html"}, {"title": "Subsurface Ocean on Pluto is Best Explanation for Findings by NASA's New Horizons", "date": "2016-11-16", "content": "The findings suggest other large objects in the Kuiper belt may also have liquid oceans beneath frozen shells. A liquid ocean lying deep beneath Pluto's frozen surface is the best explanation for features revealed by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, according to a new analysis. The idea that Pluto has a subsurface ocean is not new, but the study provides the most detailed investigation yet of its likely role in the evolution of key features such as the vast, low-lying plain known as Sputnik Planitia. Sputnik Planitia, which forms one side of the famous heart-shaped feature seen in the first New Horizons images, is suspiciously well aligned with Pluto's tidal axis. The likelihood that this is just a coincidence is only 5 percent, so the alignment suggests that extra mass in that location interacted with tidal forces between Pluto and its moon Charon to reorient Pluto, putting Sputnik Planitia directly opposite the side facing Charon. But a deep basin seems unlikely to provide the extra mass needed to cause that kind of reorientation. \"It's a big, elliptical hole in the ground, so the extra weight must be hiding somewhere beneath the surface. And an ocean is a natural way to get that,\" said Francis Nimmo, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and first author of a paper on the new findings published November 16 in Nature. Another paper in the same issue, led by James Keane at the University of Arizona, also argues for reorientation and points to fractures on Pluto as evidence that this happened. Like other large basins in the solar system, Sputnik Planitia was most likely created by the impact of a giant meteorite, which would have blasted away a huge amount of Pluto's icy crust. With a subsurface ocean, the response to this would be an upwelling of water pushing up against the thinned and weakened crust of ice. At equilibrium, because water is denser than ice, that would still leave a fairly deep basin with a thin crust of ice over the upwelled mass of water. \"At that point, there is no extra mass at Sputnik Planitia,\" Nimmo explained. \"What happens then is the ice shell gets cold and strong, and the basin fills with nitrogen ice. That nitrogen represents the excess mass.\" Nimmo and his colleages also considered whether the extra mass could be provided by just a deep crater filled with nitrogen ice, with no upwelling of a subsurface ocean. But their calculations showed that this would require an implausibly deep layer of nitrogen, more than 25 miles thick. They found that a nitrogen layer about 4 miles thick above a subsurface ocean provides enough mass to create a \"positive gravity anomaly\" consistent with the observations. \"We tried to think of other ways to get a positive gravity anomaly, and none of them look as likely as a subsurface ocean,\" Nimmo said. Coauthor Douglas Hamilton of the University of Maryland came up with the reorientation hypothesis, and Nimmo developed the subsurface ocean scenario. The scenario is analogous to what occurred on the moon, where positive gravity anomalies have been accurately measured for several large impact basins. Instead of a subsurface ocean, however, the dense mantle material beneath the moon's crust pushed up against the thinned crust of the impact basins. Lava flows then flooded the basins, adding the extra mass. On icy Pluto, the basin filled with frozen nitrogen. \"There's plenty of nitrogen in Pluto's atmosphere, and either it preferentially freezes out in this low basin, or it freezes out in the high areas surrounding the basin and flows down as glaciers,\" Nimmo said. The images from New Horizons do show what appear to be nitrogen glaciers flowing out of mountainous terrain around Sputnik Planitia. As for the subsurface ocean, Nimmo said he suspects it is mostly water with some kind of antifreeze in it, probably ammonia. The slow refreezing of the ocean would put stress on the icy shell, causing fractures consistent with features seen in the New Horizons images. There are other large objects in the Kuiper belt that are similar to Pluto in size and density, and Nimmo said they probably also have subsurface oceans. \"When we look at these other objects, they may be equally interesting, not just frozen snowballs,\" he said. In addition to Nimmo and Hamilton, the coauthors include researchers at six other institutions and the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging Team led by NASA scientist Jeffrey Moore.

Over the span of just a few hours, it took so much data with so many cameras and instruments it took a full 16 months to send it all back to Earth, a task that was just completed weeks ago. The data it sent back allowed us to construct a full map of one of Pluto's hemispheres, plus a glorious backlit shot of its night side in eclipse. But scientifically, there was so much more than a slew of beautiful pictures, and that data enabled us to understand, for the first time, the interior of a Kuiper belt world. Here on Earth, we have mountains, plateaus, plains and oceans covering the surface. But these surface variations correspond to different physical properties the farther down into the Earth's interior you go. The Earth's crust floats atop the mantle, which in turn floats above the outer and inner cores. Similarly, the ocean floats above the crust, and the atmosphere above them both. In general, the less dense layers of any world are found atop the denser layers, and that gives rise to what we see here on the surface. But just as water has to displace to stably support a ship submerged in it, a lower layer needs to displace so that mountains don't tip over or so that upswells don't destroy valleys or crustal troughs. In order for these surface variations to exist and be stable, we need the lower layers to compensate as well. On Earth, that means that the highest mountain ranges also see the crust dip into the mantle beneath those ranges a significant amount, something we can detect my intricately measuring the Earth's magnetic field. The ocean bottoms are where the crust is thinnest: only 2-5 km thick in some places. And similarly, plateaus, plains and continental shelves have identifiable features beneath the surface as well. Our active geology isn't just about what happens on the surface, but deep in the planet's interior as well. \"Reorientation of Sputnik Planitia implies a subsurface ocean on Pluto\", Nature. Pluto may not officially be an astronomical planet, but as a world, it has its own complex, interesting and active geology. A combination of four types of molecules -- nitrogen, methane, water and carbon monoxide -- can all exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous phases on Pluto, and give rise to an incredible variety of terrain. The tall, water-ice mountains; the cracked, washboard-like terrain; the cellular ice plains with flowing streams; the dark-colored highlands and more display huge variations in crustal thickness, age and altitude. An ultra-high-resolution flyover showcases some of the greatest variations. Now that the map of Pluto is complete and the varied terrain has been studied, scientists have determined regions of instability and have identified how the Plutonian interior must be behaving in order to deliver the Pluto that we see. The surface features we see are transient on significantly shorter timescales than the mountains and continents are on Earth, and faulting and mountainous reorientation must be common. Sputnik Planitia, a large, teardrop-shaped depression, represents a massive unit of actively convecting volatile ices several kilometers thick. The gravitational stresses resulting from this instability can lead to planet-wide faulting in the crust, further indicating how active Pluto is. Despite having a less-dense ice surface that must be 3-4 kilometers thick, with a denser layer more similar to the rest of Pluto's surface underneath it, this portion of Pluto exhibits a positive gravitational anomaly. Much like Earth's oceans, where the crust is thinnest, can be explained by Earth's sub- crustal mantle, Sputnik Planitia could be explained as a natural result if Pluto has a huge subsurface ocean. In particular, the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics & Imaging Theme Team indicates it: would naturally result because of shell thinning and ocean uplift, followed by later modest nitrogen deposition With a subsurface ocean, Pluto's entire geology can be explained in one fell swoop. \"Reorientation of Sputnik Planitia implies a subsurface ocean on Pluto\", Nature. Just as on Earth, we say \"it's only the tip of the iceberg\" with the full knowledge that 90% of the mass of an iceberg is submerged beneath the surface, there should be a water-ice ocean beneath an icy crust, and that crust should be thinnest underneath the crater that Sputnik Planitia resides in. The left \"lobe\" of Pluto's famous heart is the deepest depression in the Plutonian surface, and must have reoriented itself to align in a gravitationally favorable way with the Pluto-Charon axis. With this observation under our belts, we can now more accurately map the interior of Pluto than ever before. Most impressively, this research raises a tantalizing possibility: that as Sputnik Planitia continues to accumulate ices, Pluto may yet reorient itself again, as subsurface changes continue to ensue. This is possible because nitrogen becomes an atmospheric gas during the \"day\" side, but then when Pluto continues in its orbit and the nitrogen heads to the \"night\" side, it precipitates, and some of that lands in Pluto's heart. According to researcher James Keane, Each time Pluto goes around the sun, a bit of nitrogen accumulates in the > heart. And once enough ice has piled up, maybe a hundred meters thick, it > starts to overwhelm the planet's shape, which dictates the planet's orientation. And if you have an excess of mass in one spot on the planet, it > wants to go to the equator. Eventually, over millions of years, it will drag > the whole planet over. The biggest implications are for a massive subsurface ocean on Pluto, but this also indicates a world that continues to change, evolve, tip, crack and even reorient itself as time goes on. The most distant worlds in our Solar System are still active. Being frozen was never such a hot topic as it is today.

Having sent back all of the data collected during its Pluto flyby in 2015, the spacecraft is still speeding along at a velocity of 14.32 kilometers per second relative to the Sun. That has allowed it to travel almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. By last Sunday, in fact, it had come to within two years of its flyby date-January 1, 2019. At this point, mission managers are conducting operations on the fly. That's because the Hubble Space Telescope only found the object in June, 2014, barely a year before New Horizons' flyby of Pluto. When NASA formally selected MU69 as the spacecraft's next target in late 2015, scientists were in the midst of downloading and analyzing data about the Pluto system. But now the focus is shifting to the new object, and this has led to a flurry of planning as mission scientists must design, write, and test the spacecraft's command sequences for its second flyby. \"For Pluto, that job took most of 2009 to 2013,\" New Horizon's principal investor, Alan Stern, recently explained. \"But because the MU69 flyby is barely two years away, we have to compress all the planning into the next 18 months. Why? Because flyby operations for 2014 MU69 will begin in July 2018.\" So what do scientists know about MU69? Not much. Based upon Hubble's observations, it measures between 25km and 45km across. This uncertainty is due to the fact that scientists aren't sure how bright it is. It could be as dark as fresh asphalt or a little bit brighter, like a dark forest canopy. What scientists do know is that it's far away-about 44.3 astronomical units from the Sun on average, or 6.6 billion km. When New Horizons flies by MU69 in two years it will be the farthest world humans have ever explored. With its relatively small size, MU69 also represents a new class of objects for scientists to image, a midpoint between a typical comet nuclei and larger Trans-Neptunian objects like Pluto. What color will it be? Do objects like this have satellites? Will there be any surprises on its surface? Answers will be on offer in two years. This image shows New Horizons' current position along with its full planned trajectory. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory After the Pluto flyby, New Horizon's remaining fuel left a maneuvering budget of about 130 m/sec of delta-V. This left only a narrow slice of the Kuiper Belt within reach and the choice came down to two objects, MU69 and 2014 PN70. The former was chosen because, although it was less bright, it had the benefit of being more reachable. This should ensure that the spacecraft can make a closer flyby-likely much closer than the 12,500km New Horizons came within the surface of Pluto in 2015.

Some of the object's profile will be filled in by the time New Horizons reaches it, but mission managers expect many surprises as the spacecraft zips past 2014 MU69 - the target's official name - at a relative velocity of more than 9 miles per second. The little world will become the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft. \"I don't know if it's going to look like a little blackberry with little lumps that all came together or if it's going to be a fragment of some larger body with an interior cut on one side and not on the other side,\" said Will Grundy, a co-investigator on the New Horizons team from Lowell Observatory. \"But it's going to be great fun, and this all starts happening at the end of next year.\" Scientists are not sure of the object's exact size - it might be anywhere from 13 miles to 25 miles across, Grundy said - or its shape, spin rate, color, or whether 2014 MU69 has any moons or rings. \"It's basically a point source,\" Grundy said, referring to the object's appearance in images from the powerful Hubble Space Telescope. \"We've seen no companions, but we're not very sensitive to small companions or close-in companions. We don't really know what it's rotation period is. We don't really know what its light curve amplitude is. It looks like it might be red, but the error bars kind of include everything.\" Alan Stern, the New Horizon mission's principal investigator, said miniature worlds like 2014 MU69 are likely the leftover ice and rock fragments that formed larger objects like Pluto, the moons of some Uranus and Neptune, and other dwarf planets in the outer solar system. \"The small Kuiper Belt objects like MU69 that we're going to be flying out to in 2019 are thought to be the building blocks of the small planets in the Kuiper Belt, like Pluto and the others,\" Stern said in a Facebook Live event Jan. 19 highlighting the progress of the New Horizons mission. The Kuiper Belt is a ring of ancient icy remnants from the earliest part of the solar system's 4.6 billion-year history circling the sun beyond the orbit of Neptune. Its population includes continent-sized words like Pluto and the even-farther dwarf planet Eris, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of objects the size of 2014 MU69 or larger. New Horizons launched 11 years ago, on Jan. 19, 2006, flew by Jupiter for a speed boost in February 2007, and executed the first-ever close-up encounter with Pluto on July 14, 2015. The spacecraft's instruments, including a telescopic camera, a color imager, and composition-measuring spectrometers, found Pluto an unexpectedly exotic world with frozen nitrogen glaciers, a tenuous hazy atmosphere, and evidence of a possible liquid ocean and ice volcanoes. \"One thing that we disecovered is that small planets can be just as complex as big planet, and that really blew away our expectations,\" Stern said Jan. 19. \"We did not think that a planet the size of North America could be as complex as Mars or as the Earth, and yet that's what we found. \"In addition, we also found that Pluto is geologically alive, even today, that it's making new surface units, and that there are glacial flows and other kinds of activity on the surface that we didn't think could happen on a small planet billions of years after its formation,\" Stern said. \"We thought it would have cooled off by now, and run out of energy, but, in fact, it hasn't, and those two discoveries really changed the paradigm in planetary science and whet our appetite for future exploration of the Kuiper Belt.\" Scientists always hoped to keep New Horizons going after its historic Pluto flyby, but they found no suitable targets for the mission's second act until a special search with Hubble in 2014 discovered two potential objects within reach of the spacecraft's limited fuel supply. In August 2015, a month-and-a-half after New Horizons zipped by Pluto, officials selected 2014 MU69 as the favored destination for the probe's extended mission. NASA formally approved the plan last year. Earlier this month, Grundy told NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group, a forum for researchers focused on asteroids, comets and related solar system objects, that ground controllers are beginning to erase the data recorders on the New Horizons spacecraft after the robot finished downlinking the last of the data it collected at Pluto. It's a careful process because managers want to ensure nothing gets inadvertently deleted from the spacecraft's memory drives. \"We're working to erase the solid state recorders because we need to make room for new Kuiper Belt data,\" Grundy said. \"Of course, you don't want to jump the gun on that, but we need to make room, so we're having both the instrument teams look at what's on the ground, as well as the science teams. So it's both the producers and the consumers of the data who are checking off and saying, 'Yes, that really does look intact on the ground.'\" Scientists know the approximate size and orbital trajectory of the distant object now in New Horizons's sights, but little more. \"Pluto's about the size of North America, and the next object is more like the size of the Chesapeake Bay or the Great Salt Lake,\" said Kelsi Singer, a member of the New Horizons geology and geophysics team from the Southwest Research Institute. \"These smaller objects, we think, are probably more pristine and more primordial, so we're going to learn about the building blocks of the solar system by going there.\" Astronomers have studied 2014 MU69 for less than three years, leaving many questions about the distant destination unanswered. One piece of data sought by New Horizons scientists is the exact location and motion of the target. That will be aided by repeated observations by Hubble and the European Space Agency's Gaia observatory, which is surveying the entire sky to pinpoint the positions and movements of more than a billion stars, asteroids and other objects. Planning for the complicated sequence of picture-taking, composition scans and other observations scientists want New Horizons to capture at 2014 MU69 is already underway. It took four years to develop the fine pointing commands, instrument activations, and fail-safe computer logic needed for the spacecraft's high- speed visit to Pluto. For the Jan. 1, 2019, encounter with 2014 MU69, scientists and engineers have 18 months to finalize their plans. Stern and Grundy said the ground team is working on two flyby scenarios for 2014 MU69. One of the flight plans would likely have New Horizons fly within 1,900 miles of the object, a range that would allow the spacecraft's main camera to see features as small as buildings, Singer said. Officials have not picked a precise distance for the encounter. That will depend on updated orbit and motion data from Hubble and Gaia. Similar to the backup plan developed leading up to the Pluto flyby, Stern said the ground team will work on a bailout option for New Horizons in case the craft's cameras spot rings, moons or debris surrounding 2014 MU69 in the weeks before closest approach. In such a case, New Horizons could be steered on a path slightly farther from the object to ensure it does not collide with dust or ice. Such debris strikes could be fatal to the spacecraft at the projected flyby velocity. By mid-year, scientists hope to nail down an estimate for the target's rotation rate by analyzing Hubble data, but much of the flyby sequence will need to be designed before planners can incorporate that knowledge, Grundy said. Astronomers also plan to watch 2014 MU69 pass in front of a star later this year. The dimming of the background star, called a stellar occultation, could tell scientists more about the object's size and shape, and possibly reveal dust clouds, rings, or moons accompanying it. But the object's modest size mean the occultation will only be visible from a narrow band of territory. A network of astronomers around the world and NASA's airborne infrared observatory, known as SOFIA, will try to catch the act. \"This is going to be very challenging, but valuable,\" Grundy said of the Earth-based observing campaign. Meanwhile, engineers at New Horizons's mission control are fine-tuning the probe's trajectory with a series of course correction maneuvers by the craft's rocket thrusters. \"As we learn more about the orbit of MU69 and know exactly where we need to head, we'll execute some more of these maneuvers, possibly as many as 10,\" said Helene Winters, New Horizons project manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Four rocket burns in late 2015 did most of the retargeting, but engineers believe more are needed, beginning with a maneuver scheduled for Feb. 1, Winters said in the Facebook Live event last week. The science team also intends to take pictures of up to two dozen other known Kuiper Belt objects over the next year-and-a-half. The spacecraft will not get close to those bodies - they will be millions of miles away - but New Horizons will be much closer to them than any telescope. \"This is the first time we've had essentially an astronomical observatory in the Kuiper Belt looking at objects that are too faint to study in this way from the Earth,\" said Stern, a scientist based at SWRI. Measurements of the solar wind and plasma environment in the outer solar system are also on the mission's docket. NASA has committed to fund the New Horizons mission through 2021, when all the data gathered from the January 2019 flyby should be back on the ground. It will take even longer to downlink science data from New Horizons after the visit to 2014 MU69 than the 15 months needed to return all the observations of Pluto. At the vast distance to the mission's next destination, it will take more than 12 hours for radio signals to travel the round-trip between the spaceraft and Earth, and the transmission rate will slow to a crawl. New Horizons could be granted another mission extension after 2021 to continue monitoring its surroundings as it escapes the solar system, following in the footsteps of the trailblazing Voyager probes. The craft draws on the heat from a plutonium power source for electricity. \"The spacecraft is about 400 million miles beyond Pluto and some 3.5 billion miles from Earth, and it's doing just fine,\" said Glen Fountain, former project manager for New Horizons, during the Facebook Live event. \"All the systems aboard are working. We have plenty of power to continue the mission out though the Kuiper Belt flyby we'll do later, and further beyond that. \"The power decreases as we get further away in time because the plutonium on- board has about an 80-year half-life, so it's slowly losing power, but we can still run until about the mid-2030s,\" Fountain said.

Nearly two years after its historic encounter with the dwarf planet Pluto, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is getting ready for its next big adventure in the icy outskirts of the solar system. Now, the spacecraft is on its way to a small, ancient object located about 1 billion miles beyond Pluto in the Kuiper Belt. This distant region surrounds the solar system and is filled with trillions of icy rocks that have yet to be explored. The new target was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in June 2014, and it was dubbed 2014 MU69. Pluto, which officially lost its planetary status shortly after New Horizons launched in 2006, is also a Kuiper Belt object, and the largest of its kind. New Horizons became the first spacecraft to visit the Pluto system when the probe flew by the dwarf planet and its moons on July 14, 2015. A world of discoveries It took the spacecraft about 16 months to beam back all of its data from the Pluto flyby, and planetary scientists have had a ball with that data. \"The New Horizons flyby of the Pluto system was completely successful, and now we've got all the data on the ground and we're putting a bow around it,\" Alan Stern, the New Horizons principal investigator at Southwest Research Institute, said in a Facebook Live event on Thursday. Thanks to New Horizons, scientists now have a global map of Pluto and the most detailed images yet of the dwarf planet's bizarre, mountainous landscape and icy volcanoes. Tall mountain ranges seen on Pluto also suggest recent geological activity on the dwarf planet's surface. New Horizons additionally beamed back a gorgeous photo of a huge, heart-shaped basin that quickly became Pluto's most famous feature, taking the internet by storm and gracing the front page of hundreds of newspapers worldwide. The New Horizons science team has said Pluto's \"heart\" seems to indicate the presence of a subsurface ocean. The Pluto flyby also provided an opportunity to study Pluto's moons, particularly Charon. Researchers discovered that Charon and Pluto are both tidally locked, meaning the same side of the moon always faces the dwarf planet and vice-versa. As a result, Pluto's heart is always facing Charon. A giant red spot discovered on Charon's surface revealed that the moon is taking some of its atmosphere from Pluto. \"One thing that we discovered is that small planets can be just as complex as big planets, and that really blew away our expectations,\" Stern said, adding that all the new findings from Pluto \"wet our appetite for future exploration of the Kuiper Belt.\" Exploring beyond Pluto While the team continues to analyze the plethora of data - something that could go on for decades - it's also busy planning for the next big stage of the mission, the flyby of 2014 MU69. That will occur in January 2019. Pluto is the largest object known to exist in the Kuiper Belt, but MU69 is much smaller and more representative of the trillions of other KBOs, Kelsi Singer of the New Horizons science team told Space.com. Pluto is comparable to the size of North America at 1,475 miles in diameter, while MU69 is less than 30 miles across. But MU69 isn't just any old KBO. Singer said that the object \"has a special kind of orbit that makes it possibly a type of object that is primordial and left over from early solar system formation. So we think that we'll be able to look at what the building blocks of the solar system were like by going to this special object that has a special orbit.\" Plutonium power Part of the rationale for choosing MU69 as the next target was that it had a good location given the amount of fuel left on the New Horizons spacecraft. \"MU69 turned out to be really interesting, but we also had limited options,\" Singer said. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, \"we were searching the area of space where we had enough fuel left in the spacecraft to get to any objects that were there,\" she said. Three good potential targets were located, but the other two \"were just on the edge of where the spacecraft had enough fuel to get to.\" New Horizons runs on a radioactive plutonium power supply that could keep the spacecraft going through the mid-2030s, Glen Fountain, the New Horizons encounter project manager at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, said during the Facebook Live event. But after the 2019 flyby of MU69, the spacecraft probably won't have much fuel left for special maneuvers, Singer said. \"We won't be able to switch directions, but we'll still keep going out. It's possible that we'll be able to observe some other objects, but we haven't identified any of them yet. So we're going to keep an eye out to see what we can find.\" Get ready for MU69! For now, the team will remain focused on planning the MU69 flyby and sifting through data from Pluto. The researchers need to plan the spacecraft's every move far ahead of time; because of a 6-hour delay in communications with the distant spacecraft, they won't be able to tell the probe what to do in real time. Instead, the team must program New Horizons at least several months in advance to do every observation and data transmission. The spacecraft will take photos of MU69 along the way, starting out with pictures of a single-pixel speck from afar, Singer said. During the flyby, New Horizons will be able to get even closer to MU69 than it did with Pluto, because the small object has much less gravity. This means that the photos of MU69 will have a higher resolution than the photos of Pluto. Singer said that's something she and the team look forward to seeing. In April, New Horizons will be halfway to MU69 from Pluto, with 21 months of spaceflight left to go.

The course adjustment was based on improved data from measurements taken by both the spacecraft and the Hubble Space Telescope refining the KBO's orbit in relation to New Horizons' current position. This was the first course correction for the spacecraft since four maneuvers in the fall of 2015 adjusted its course toward MU69, which it will fly by on Jan. 1, 2019. Computer commands uploaded to New Horizons directed the firing of its thrusters for 44 seconds, altering the probe's velocity by approximately 1.4 feet per second or slightly under 1 mph. \"One mile per hour might not sound like much, but over the next 23 months, as we approach MU69, that maneuver will add up to an aim point refinement of almost 6,000 miles ,\" said Principal Investigator Alan Stern. Radio signals confirming the maneuver's success, traveling more than 3.5 billion miles from the spacecraft back to NASA's Deep Space Network stations in Goldstone, California, and Canberra, Australia, took more than five hours to reach Earth, traveling at the speed of light. New Horizons spent last week in \"three-axis stabilized mode\" - a position that enabled it to make telescopic observations of several distant large KBOs. Data collected during this time will reveal these KBOs' shapes, surface properties, and moons. Such detailed observations cannot be conducted from Earth, which is why mission scientists are taking advantage of the spacecraft's position in the Kuiper Belt to collect this data.

The spacecraft reached that milestone at midnight on April 3rd - or 7:00pm CT on April 2nd - when it was 486.19 million miles beyond Pluto and the same distance from MU69. \"It's fantastic to have completed half the journey to our next flyby; that flyby will set the record for the most distant world ever explored in the history of civilization,\" said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Later this week - at 21:24 UTC on April 7th - New Horizons will also reach the halfway point in time between closest approaches to Pluto, which occurred at 6:48am CT on July 14th, 2015, and MU69, predicted for 1:00am CT on New Year's Day 2019. The nearly five-day difference between the halfway markers of distance and time is due to the gravitational tug of the sun. The spacecraft is actually getting slightly slower as it pulls away from the sun's gravity, so the spacecraft crosses the midpoint in distance a bit before it passes the midpoint in time. # Ready for a Rest New Horizons will begin a new period of hibernation later this week. In fact, the spacecraft will be sleeping through the April 7th halfway timing marker to MU69, because mission operators at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, will have put the spacecraft into hibernation two hours beforehand. The scheduled 157-day hibernation is well-deserved; New Horizons has been \"awake\" for almost two and a half years, since December 6th, 2014. Since then, in addition to its historic Pluto encounter and 16 subsequent months of relaying the data from that encounter back to Earth, New Horizons has made breakthrough, distant observations of a dozen Kuiper Belt objects, collected unique data on the dust and charged-particle environment of the Kuiper Belt, and studied the hydrogen gas that permeates the vast space surrounding the sun, called the heliosphere. \"The January 2019 MU69 flyby is the next big event for us, but New Horizons is truly a mission to more broadly explore the Kuiper Belt,\" said Hal Weaver, New Horizons project scientist from APL, in Laurel, Maryland. \"In addition to MU69, we plan to study more than two-dozen other KBOs in the distance and measure the charged particle and dust environment all the way across the Kuiper Belt.\" New Horizons is currently 3.5 billion miles from Earth; at that distance, a radio signal sent from the operations team - and traveling at light speed - needs about five hours and 20 minutes to reach the spacecraft.

That is, the sum of the universe's emitted optical light from beyond our own Milky Way galaxy. In a paper in the journal Nature Communications, the authors detail how they used the spacecraft's archival data acquired during its cruise phase to make the cleanest-ever observations of this extragalactic light. The data was acquired at wavelengths roughly visible to the human eye with the spacecraft's Long Range Reconnaissance 20.8-centimeter Imager. \"There have been several measurements of the COB over the years, many in fairly violent disagreement with one another,\" Michael Zemcov, an astrophysicist at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York state, and the paper's lead author, told me. \"This one is the cleanest yet in the sense that we don't have to deal with the bright light reflected from dust in the inner solar system.\" Artist conception of New Horizons Spacecraft. As the authors note, New Horizons' serendipitous observations include emission from known astrophysical processes in galaxies --- including stellar nucleosynthesis; mass accretion onto black holes; and the gravitational collapse of stars. Getting out beyond our solar system's zodiacal light is the key to making such observations. Simply put, zodiacal light is a diffuse cone of light in the plane of the sky that is most visible from Earth in the East just before sunrise; and in the West just after sunset. In our own solar system, astronomers think it's mostly caused by the reflection of sunlight from tiny particles of dust leftover from collisions in our Main Asteroid Belt. \"The sunlight scattered off dust in the solar system is some 100 times brighter than the signal we're trying to measure,\" said Zemcov. \"In the outer solar system, that component completely disappears, and your biggest problem actually becomes the diffuse light scattered from dust in our galaxy.\" But once past the orbit of Jupiter, most of this cosmic dust disappears and the solar system's sky gets increasingly darker. Thus, for the past decade there's been discussion of actually launching dedicated optical telescopes to cruise out beyond Jupiter to get a darker and more unobstructed view of our galaxy and beyond. Zemcov says his team is continuing to use this archival data to determine whether there is an optical light component that isn't explained by the galaxies they have measured. He says that might be stars flung from their galaxies; decaying dark matter particles; or even very faint, small galaxies that can't be easily measured with current techniques. Gallery: Brilliant views of the Universe's most distant galaxies from Hubble What's most surprising about any of this? That New Horizons was able to look at some relatively empty patches of sky that let us disentangle the background from the more local emission, Zemcov says. He notes these are some of the first astrophysical measurements to come from an instrument beyond the orbit of Saturn. In addition to observing the COB, Zemcov says that observations from the outer solar system can also help astronomers make better distance measurements to distant stars and galaxies; as well as look for exoplanets and distant supernovae. \"This is one of the first astrophysical measurements to come from an instrument beyond the orbit of Saturn,\" said Zemcov. He says once the New Horizons spacecraft completes its Kuiper belt mission in 2021, ideally, its imager would be used for dedicated astrophysics observations. Zemcov says that's an issue already being discussed with NASA.

The craft is still hurling out into the void, and on New Year's Day, 2019, it will fly past a mysterious object out in the frigid realms of the outer solar system known as the Kuiper Belt. The target Kuiper Belt Object is known as 2014 MU69 2014MU69 for the year it was discovered. The encounter to start 2019 will be the first time a spacecraft visits an object that was not discovered until after the spacecraft was already launched. When New Horizons launched in January 2006, the team had some plans for Jupiter observations during a gravity assist flyby. They also knew the craft would still have some gas in the tank after it flew by the primary target for the mission, Pluto and its system of moons. But it wasn't until June 2014, eight and a half years after launch and a year before the Pluto flyby, that the Hubble Space Telescope spotted a small KBO for the first time, subsequently known as 2014 MU69. The object become the post-Pluto target for New Horizons. Just four and a half years after its discovery, MU69 will receive close examination in a flyby mission, the quickest turnaround from discovery to flyby in human history. More From Popular Mechanics So what is this 2014 MU69 going to be like? Well we don't really know, but astronomers around the world are working to take new observations of the target to gather as much information as possible before the flyby. Originally estimated at around 10 to 30 miles in diameter, recent observations have led researchers to suspect the object is either smaller than that, but particularly bright and reflective, or that it is perhaps even multiple objects. MU69 recently moved in front of the light from a distant star on June 3, an event known as an occultation, similar in a way to a solar eclipse or a planetary transit, but smaller and quicker. The shadow caused by MU69 as it blocked the background star's light quickly raced across South Africa and Argentina. More than 50 astronomers positioned on both continents set up something of a fence line of telescopes along the predicted path of the shadow, hoping to catch a two-second glimpse of the occultation. The astronomers were able to capture the change in light, but did not pinpoint the object itself. This tells the team that MU69 might be smaller than originally thought, although it seemed larger in the original Hubble images because it is particularly reflective. Or perhaps MU69 is not only one object. \"These results are telling us something really interesting,\" New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute said in a press release. \"The fact that we accomplished the occultation observations from every planned observing site but didn't detect the object itself likely means that either MU69 is highly reflective and smaller than some expected, or it may be a binary or even a swarm of smaller bodies left from the time when the planets in our solar system formed.\" In any case, MU69 should be a fascinating little world. If it is a binary or group of objects, their interactions with each other could tell us much about the early solar system, planetary formation, and the process celestial objects go through when they coalesce. If it is one smaller object, then it is very bright, and it could be a gleaming icy chunk of reflective material. New Horizons, equipped with one of the most advanced telescope-cameras we have beyond Earth orbit, the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager, should capture crystal clear images of MU69 during the flyby.

NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI Two more occultation events are coming up this month, on July 10 and July 17, and you can count on the persistent astronomers to be out there forming another fence line of small telescopes for more observations. On July 10, NASA's 747 with a large 2.5-meter telescope tucked inside, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, will also observe MU69 to gather more data and look for debris that could pose a threat to New Horizons as it flies by. During the July 17 event, NASA will point Hubble toward MU69 again for the same reasons. In 18 months, on the first day of 2019, New Horizons will make closest approach to the mysterious object, and a day or so later MU69 will be revealed in all its small icy glory. Then maybe finally the little celestial object will earn itself a new name.

Streetlights blinked out, and a major highway closed for two hours to prevent the glare of headlights from obstructing the view of 24 portable telescopes all pointing at a distant, unnamed star. Semi-trailer trucks were driven to remote locations to help block the telescopes from the harsh, Patagonian winter wind. Then 60 researchers waited for the star to blink. They were watching for the few fractions of a second when a distant object in our solar system would zip in front of the star, giving us our closest and best look at the next target for NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, which is still speeding through the outer solar system after its triumphant flyby of Pluto two years ago. 2014 MU69 is a cold classical object a billion miles further away than Pluto. It's something that researchers think has been around since the very early days of the solar system. We don't know much about it-not even its size or shape. But thanks to measurements gathered by the Hubble, we do know its trajectory. The effort on Sunday was the last in a set of three observations that occurred in June and earlier in July in an attempt by astronomers to get a better look at the object before New Horizons goes flying by it on New Year's Day, 2019. By watching as 2014 MU69 passes in front of a light source like a star researchers can get more information about how big the object is, and if there is any debris around it that might pose a problem for New Horizons. The first two attempts yielded some information, but didn't quite capture 2014 MU69 crossing directly in front of a star. The last effort had more luck. New Horizons scientist Amanda Zangari was the first to notice that the telescope she was working on had captured the needed data. In the end, five of the 24 telescopes that were deployed managed to catch MU69 in action, which is great news for scientists. \"If you have one measurement of a shadow you can only really measure the minimum size of the object,\" says Alex Parker, a NASA astronomer on the project who also was on the team that discovered 2014 MU69. \"More than one, then you can really start to constrain the actual size of the object because you can start to tease out its shape. But with five you can do a really good job. \" Parker says that while it will take a while to process, the new information can help the team figure out how to calibrate New Horizons' instruments for the flyby. Knowing if the object is large and dark, small and bright, or some other combination can help the team decide whether to have a long or short exposure on New Horizons' cameras, enhancing the chances that we'll get images and data from the most distant object ever explored by human technology. \"This is really the first time we're seeing the size of the object we're sending New Horizons to,\" Parker says. Parker wasn't at the latest mission to Argentina, but participated in one of the earlier attempts this year. He was also part of the group scouting locations for where to set up the telescopes. \"We had to go up to farmers' doors and say 'Hi, we're here from NASA, we're wondering if we can set up telescopes in your back pasture?'\" Parker says. \"More often than not people were like 'that sounds awesome, sure, we'll help out!'\" In order to know which fields were suitable, astronomers had to develop completely new methods of combining data from the Hubble with an existing and remarkably detailed star catalogue. That enabled them to predict where the shadow of the object would fall on Earth at a particular time. The fact that it worked is incredibly exciting to everyone working on the New Horizons project, because it gives them more confidence in their measurements as they continue to ramp up planning for the 2019 flyby. \"This is kind of sight unseen. We're flying to this object whose orbit around the sun takes hundreds of years, we only discovered it in 2014, it's the faintest object that we've ever tracked for more than a year with any kind of telescope facility, and we're trying to fly a spacecraft to it,\" Parker says. \"We're doing this flyby at super high speed, so it all comes down to being extremely precise and accurate with our modeling and knowing where it is.\" ", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/new-horizons-next-target/"}, {"title": "New Horizons' next target: spotted", "date": "2017-07-25", "content": "NASA's New Horizons spacecraft changed our view of the outer solar system forever when it flew by Pluto in 2015. Now, it's on its way to the next destination: a Kuiper Belt object known only as 2014 MU69. Although the spacecraft won't reach its target until New Year's Day in 2019, NASA is already looking ahead to learn as much about 2014 MU69 as possible, thanks to a convenient temporary alignment that recently allowed the object to pass in front of a background star. The passage, called an occultation, occurs when objects \"line up\" in the sky as viewed from Earth. When an object, such as an asteroid, planet, dwarf planet, or KBO, passes in front of a distant star, astronomers can watch the way the starlight dims and returns to gain information about the object passing in front of it. This information can include size, shape, and even whether the object possesses rings, moons, or an atmosphere. The recent occultation was visible from the Southern Hemisphere; the New Horizons team used 24 mobile telescopes in Argentina to view the event, which lasted only about two seconds. This effort, which thus far has yielded five successful occultation detections, is vital to the characterization of 2014 MU69 before New Horizons arrives. That's because this tiny, distant object is poorly understood; currently, it's believed to span about 14-25 miles in diameter, but little else is known about its shape and composition - thus far.

After that successful mission, the agency has pointed the probe at another target, 2014 MU69, a Kuiper Belt Object in the region of space beyond Pluto full of comets, asteroids, space debris and dwarf planets. Now, as Kenneth Chang at The New York Times reports, astronomers have gotten a better glimpse of the MU69, and it might be more interesting than previously thought. As Chang reports, astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope first located MU69 in 2014 as they looked for a post-Pluto mission for New Horizons. Measuring just 20 miles wide, MU69 appeared to be a measly speck in the sky. But the sighting provided just enough information for researchers to calculate its orbit. Though it zipped through space a billion miles beyond Pluto, New Horizons could reach it. Now, researchers have learned a lot more about the space rock, according to a press release. That's because MU69 happened to pass in front of three different stars in just two months. The events, called occultations, happen when the object blocks out the star and casts a tiny shadow on Earth. Using that data, researchers can calculate the speed and size of the object. But after an exhausting scramble to prepare for the big moment, the scientists missed the first pass, Kelly Beatty at Sky & Telescope reports. On June 3 the star never darkened in the glass eyes of the 24 telescopes in South Africa and Argentina that were watching for the wink, Chang reports. They also missed a second occultation on July 10 while observing the asteroid from Fiji. \"I was physically and emotionally exhausted, psychically damaged,\" Marc Buie, a member of the New Horizons team, tells Chang. In late June and early July, measurements from Hubble of the space rock helped the astronomers refine their search. They set up a line of amateur astronomers along a three mile-long path in a remote stretch of Argentina, reports Chang. The winds were so strong, locals positioned tractor-trailers trucks as wind breaks. But the waiting paid off. Five out of 24 observers detected the light cutting out as MU69 passed in front of a star. Based on those observations, astronomers now believe MU69 is either one long, skinny, potato-shaped asteroid less than 20 miles in length. The other possibility is that it is two spheres, each 9 to 12 miles wide, circling each other or even touching, something known as a contact binary. \"This new finding is simply spectacular. The shape of MU69 is truly provocative, and could mean another first for New Horizons going to a binary object in the Kuiper Belt,\" Alan Stern, principal investigator for New Horizons says in the press release. \"I could not be happier with the occultation results, which promise a scientific bonanza for the flyby.\" As Beatty reports, observations of MU69 conducted by Susan Benecchi of the Planetary Science Institute between June and July also suggest the object may be a binary asteroid. While the shape of MU69 is interesting, the occultation observation also had a bigger purpose. It also showed that there's no debris around MU69 that could damage New Horizons when it makes it's anticipated pass of the KBO on January 1, 2019.

Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 famously carry copies of the \"Golden Record,\" which are loaded with photos, music, sounds and other data designed to teach any extraterrestrials who might encounter the probes about humanity and its home planet. Though such an alien encounter isn't likely, it is possible; Voyager 1 popped into interstellar space in August 2012, and its twin will probably do the same in the next few years, mission team members have said. New Horizons' ultimate fate also lies beyond the solar system, \"and it's leaving without a Golden Record, without a message,\" said Jon Lomberg, the design director for the Voyagers' Golden Record., who chaired the committee that decided what information the record would contain.) \"That seems like a missed opportunity,\" he said. Lomberg wants to change things, by giving New Horizons a \"Golden Record 2.0\" - a new, crowdsourced digital version called the One Earth Message, which would be beamed out to the spacecraft in 2020. On Aug. 20 - the 40th anniversary of Voyager 2's liftoff - he and his team launched a 40-day Kickstarter campaign, which seeks $72,000 to develop and maintain a website that will manage the photos and other material people submit for possible inclusion in the One Earth Message. If all goes according to plan, online voting will determine which content will ultimately make up the message. The group is also seeking funding via other means. For example, Lomberg is auctioning off his collection of Voyager Golden-Record archival material, which includes his original sketch for the cover diagram, numerous other drawings, and letters about the project from sci-fi legend Robert Heinlein and other notable people. Heritage Auctions will manage the sale, which will take place Sept. 14. The collection is expected to fetch about $10,000, Heritage representatives told Space.com. As such fundraising efforts suggest, NASA is not sponsoring or bankrolling the One Earth Message. However, agency officials and New Horizons team members have unofficially signaled support for the project, Lomberg said. New Horizons, which flew past Pluto in July 2015, is now zooming toward a Jan. 1, 2019, rendezvous with a small object called 2014 MU69. It may take a year or so for the probe to beam all of its data from this second flyby home to Earth, Lomberg said; only then will New Horizons be able to spare the computer memory necessary to accommodate the One Earth Message. \"That gives us a good two years to first put the message together, which I estimate will take at least a year, and then another year to put it all together in software, test it and make sure it's suitable for upload,\" Lomberg said. The upload to New Horizons would not happen without official NASA approval. This approval might be easier to obtain if the team approaches the agency with a finished product rather than a nebulous concept, Lomberg said. \"Forty years ago, when I worked with Carl on the Golden Record, he didn't go to NASA and try to get them to approve some vague idea of the message's music and sounds,\" Lomberg said. \"He made it, and then he showed it to them and said what we did. They reacted to it. And if there was something they didn't like - and there was one picture they didn't like - they took it out.\" Lomberg's vision for the One Earth Message doesn't end with New Horizons. Eventually, he would like every probe that leaves Earth to carry the message, or something like it. \"I think our spacecraft are our finest technical masterpieces,\" he said. \"They're essentially works of art, and every work of art should be signed.\" \"Signing\" probes in this fashion is worth the effort, even if they drift alone through space for eternity, Lomberg added. \"We will never know if there is an E.T. audience, but for the human audience that participates, it can be a profoundly moving experience to seriously contemplate communicating with the cosmos,\" he said in a statement.

New Horizons woke from a five-month hibernation period - its first stretch of rest since before its epic Pluto flyby in July 2015 - last week, right on schedule, mission team members said. The probe is in good health and ready to resume studying the dark, frigid depths of the Kuiper Belt, the ring of bodies beyond Neptune's orbit, they added. \"It's another working science cruise through the Kuiper Belt for New Horizons,\" mission operations manager Alice Bowman, of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland, said in a statement. From now until mid-December, New Horizons will take the Kuiper Belt's measure, studying the region's radiation environment, gas and dust concentrations, and other characteristics. The spacecraft will also observe a number of Kuiper Belt objects from afar, using its telescopic camera, mission team members said. In addition, New Horizons' handlers will test the probe's scientific instruments, making sure everything is working ahead of a planned Jan. 1, 2019, flyby of a small KBO called 2014 MU69. This flyby - which will take New Horizons about three times closer to 2014 MU69 than it got to Pluto back in 2015 - is the centerpiece of the spacecraft's extended mission, which NASA approved last year. On Dec. 9, New Horizons will fire its engines to refine its course toward 2014 MU69. Then, on Dec. 22, the probe will go into hibernation again; it will wake on June 4, 2018, to prep for the upcoming flyby, mission team members said. The $700 million New Horizons mission, which launched in January 2006, got the first-ever good looks at Pluto during the spacecraft's historic flyby, revealing the dwarf planet to be a stunningly complex world with vast nitrogen-ice plains, towering mountains of water ice and a diversity of other landscapes. New Horizons is currently about 3.62 billion miles from Earth - so far away that it takes commands more than 5 hours to reach the probe at the speed of light.

They are seeking additional insights to how the solar system formed and evolved. NASA selected University of Virginia astronomer Anne Verbiscer as an assistant project scientist to help pick which chunks of rock and ice, among millions, to observe as the spacecraft rushes along at 30,800 mph on its 3-billion-mile journey into deep space. A planetary scientist, Verbiscer has been involved with the New Horizons project for three years. She was part of the team that identified its next flyby target, and is playing a key role in determining New Horizons' flight path through the Kuiper Belt. Verbiscer also continues to work with other astronomers on interpreting data and images gleaned from the 2015 Pluto flyby. Through an exhaustive survey conducted in 2014 by the Hubble Space Telescope, Verbiscer and her team first narrowed the candidates of possible Kuiper Belt flyby targets to two finalists, before selecting the one that will be scrutinized by New Horizons' cameras and sensors when it flies within 2,200 miles of the object's surface on Jan. 1, 2019. \"We found a target along the trajectory of the spacecraft that is likely to reveal interesting and important new information about the composition of the outer solar system,\" Verbiscer said from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado where she is working closely this year with other project managers. The chosen object is dubbed Kuiper Belt Object 2014 MU69, and New Horizons will fly by, take images and gather data on the approach, during the pass and then through the rearview mirror, as the object quickly recedes from view. Currently, all that is known about Kuiper Belt objects similar to MU69 is that they are \"small, dark and red,\" Verbiscer said. MU69 is only about the size of one of Pluto's smallest moons, but a close pass of its surface terrain will reveal much about the makings of the Kuiper Belt generally - how planets and other objects may have formed billions of years ago, creating an enormous band of material, circling the sun at the outer limits of its gravitational reach. Verbiscer last summer spent several cold and windy nights in South Africa and Argentina seeking a Kuiper Belt object to be studied in detail during a 2019 New Horizons flyby. The Kuiper Belt is a vast region of icy and rocky objects orbiting the sun millions of miles beyond Pluto. The belt's biggest objects, which may be planet fragments or giant chunks of ice embedded with pieces of planets that collided during the formation of the solar system, are so small they are nearly invisible to even the most powerful telescopes, including Hubble, which offers the best view - at least until New Horizons starts sending back thousands of images and other data that will reveal more in a moment about the region than astronomers have learned and surmised in decades of trying to observe the nearly unobservable. To help characterize the flyby target, Verbiscer last June led and worked with international teams of astronomers in South Africa and Argentina, seeking evidence of the size and precise location of MU69 - important information to help NASA tweak, ever so slightly, the trajectory of New Horizons, to allow a reasonably close pass without expending too much of its limited propulsion fuel and to optimize the observations for the size and brightness of MU69. \"We used multiple portable telescopes located in remote regions on Earth to observe MU69 as it blocked out the light from a distant star, an event known as an occultation,\" Verbiscer said. \"A lot of planning went into these occultation expeditions, and we succeeded in watching the star wink out for a quick moment, an eclipse essentially, which proved to us that MU69 is where we expected it to be at exactly the time we predicted.\" The missions on the southern ends of two continents included UVA astronomers Mike Skrutskie, John Wilson, Matt Nelson and several students, including undergraduates. By proving the location and size of MU69, the ground-based astronomers provided highly valuable data to NASA for achieving the upcoming flyby. Once the flyby occurs, data will stream back over months for Verbiscer and her colleagues to examine, analyze and ultimately win a new understanding of the farthest reaches of our solar system. \"The New Horizons mission is exploration in its purest form,\" Verbiscer said. \"We are venturing into a relic region that has essentially been untouched since the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. Everything we see from within the Kuiper Belt will be a new discovery.\" ", "url": "https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-astronomer-selected-guide-new-horizons-spacecraft-new-tiny-world"}, {"title": "Return to Pluto? Scientists Push for New Mission to Outer Solar System", "date": "2017-10-27", "content": "A grassroots movement seeks to build momentum for a second NASA mission to the outer solar system, a generation after a similar effort helped give rise to the first one. That first mission, of course, was New Horizons, which in July 2015 performed the first-ever flyby of Pluto and is currently cruising toward a January 2019 close encounter with a small object known as 2014 MU69. New Horizons got its start with letter-writing campaigns in the late 1980s, and the new project hopes to duplicate that success, said campaign co-leader Kelsi Singer, a New Horizons team member who's based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Nearly three dozen scientists have drafted letters in support of a potential return mission to Pluto or to another destination in the Kuiper Belt, the ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit, Singer told Space.com. These letters have been sent to NASA planetary science chief Jim Green, as well as to the chairs of several committees that advise the agency, she added. \"We need the community to realize that people are interested,\" Singer said. \"We need the community to realize that there are important, unmet goals. And we need the community to realize that this should have a spot somewhere in the Decadal Survey.\" That would be the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, a report published by the National Academy of Sciences that lays out the nation's top exploration priorities for the coming decade. \"This is the way it normally works,\" said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, who's also based at SwRI. \"First it bubbles up in the community and then, when there's enough action, the agency starts to get behind it,\" Stern, who has been the driving force behind New Horizons since the very beginning, told Space.com. \"Then it lets the Decadal Survey sort things out.\" Stern contributed a letter to the new campaign, and he has voiced support for a dedicated Pluto orbiter. Singer would also be happy if NASA went back to the dwarf planet. \"Pluto just has so much going on,\" she said. But there are other exciting options available as well, Singer said. For example, NASA could do a flyby of a different faraway dwarf planet - Eris, perhaps - to get a better idea of the variety and diversity of these intriguing worlds. Or the agency could target Kuiper Belt objects that have diameters of a few hundred kilometers or so, she added. New Horizons has flown by one \"big\" KBO and will soon see a small one - 2014 MU69 is just 20 miles or so across - but there are no plans at the moment to study anything of an intermediate size up close. The last Decadal Survey was put out in 2011, and it covers the years 2013 to 2022. The next one is due out in five years, and it will help map out NASA's plans for the 2020s and early 2030s. So Singer knows she and her colleagues must be patient, even if their letter-writing campaign ultimately bears fruit. \"I would say 25 years is the longest I think about,\" she said, referring to how long it may be before another Kuiper Belt mission gets to its destination. \"And I hope it may be more like 15 years.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/38589-new-pluto-mission-letter-writing-campaign.html"}, {"title": "Help nickname New Horizons' next flyby target", "date": "2017-11-09", "content": "NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt is looking for your ideas on what to informally name its next flyby destination, a billion miles past Pluto. On New Year's Day 2019, the New Horizons spacecraft will fly past a small, frozen world in the Kuiper Belt, at the outer edge of our solar system. The target Kuiper Belt object currently goes by the official designation \" 2014 MU69.\" NASA and the New Horizons team are asking the public for help in giving \"MU69\" a nickname to use for this exploration target. \"New Horizons made history two years ago with the first close-up look at Pluto, and is now on course for the farthest planetary encounter in the history of spaceflight,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"We're pleased to bring the public along on this exciting mission of discovery.\" After the flyby, NASA and the New Horizons project plan to choose a formal name to submit to the International Astronomical Union, based in part on whether MU69 is found to be a single body, a binary pair, or perhaps a system of multiple objects. The chosen nickname will be used in the interim. \"New Horizons has always been about pure exploration, shedding light on new worlds like we've never seen before,\" said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \"Our close encounter with MU69 adds another chapter to this mission's remarkable story. We're excited for the public to help us pick a nickname for our target that captures the excitement of the flyby and awe and inspiration of exploring this new and record-distant body in space.\" The naming campaign is hosted by the SETI Institute of Mountain View, California, and led by Mark Showalter, an institute fellow and member of the New Horizons science team. The website includes names currently under consideration; site visitors can vote for their favorites or nominate names they think should be added to the ballot. \"The campaign is open to everyone,\" Showalter said. \"We are hoping that somebody out there proposes the perfect, inspiring name for MU69.\" The campaign will close at 3 pm EST/12 noon PST on Dec. 1. NASA and the New Horizons team will review the top vote-getters and announce their selection in early January. Telescopic observations of MU69, which is more than 4 billion miles from Earth, hint at the Kuiper Belt object being either a binary orbiting pair or a contact pair of nearly like-sized bodies - meaning the team might actually need two or more temporary tags for its target. \"Many Kuiper Belt Objects have had informal names at first, before a formal name was proposed. After the flyby, once we know a lot more about this intriguing world, we and NASA will work with the International Astronomical Union to assign a formal name to MU69,\" Showalter said. \"Until then, we're excited to bring people into the mission and share in what will be an amazing flyby on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, 2019!\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2017/11/09/help-nickname-new-horizons-next-flyby-target/"}, {"title": "New Horizons in Physics Prize goes to Ohio State scientist", "date": "2017-12-04", "content": "When the \"Oscars of science\" were awarded Sunday night at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, an astrophysicist from The Ohio State University received a top prize for young researchers. Christopher Hirata received the New Horizons in Physics Prize \"for fundamental contributions to understanding the physics of early galaxy formation and to sharpening and applying the most powerful tools of precision cosmology,\" according to the awarders of the annual Breakthrough Prize. The prize awards $100,000 to promising junior researchers who have made an especially strong mark on science early in their careers. The awards have been called the Oscars of science because the ceremony comes with a fair amount of Hollywood glamour, including a red carpet and a televised award ceremony. Academy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman hosted the show and Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher and Kerry Washington served as award presenters. Hirata's work has centered on the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy, which researchers believe control how galaxies form and how the universe expands. Less than a decade ago, he performed calculations that proved that most atoms in the early universe would have been moving too fast to be captured by dark matter, which must have delayed the formation of the first galaxies. \"For this he dove into a 40-year-old subject and emerged with new physics that no one else had noticed, something that has big implications for understanding the early history of structure in the universe,\" said David Weinberg, Distinguished University Professor in Astronomy at Ohio State. As a professor of physics and astronomy at Ohio State and a member of the Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics, Hirata has drawn together work in physics theory, observation, computing and statistics to enable the growth of a branch of science known as \"precision cosmology.\" Cosmology is the study of the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe, so putting the word \"precision\" before it sounds like an oxymoron. But it's actually the merger of computing power, high-resolution telescopes and cosmological theory that has allowed scientists to connect precise measures of the masses of galaxies and dark matter to the universe's behavior as a whole. And it's Hirata's ability to be equally comfortable working with big data, device engineering and theoretical physics that has raised his profile in the astrophysics community. For instance, as a member of the science team for NASA's upcoming WFIRST space telescope, Hirata works with the project engineers who are designing the instruments so that when WFIRST launches in the 2020s, it will gather data that astrophysicists will find most useful. \"Chris is remarkable not just for his extreme brilliance but for the way he applies it, to problems that range from the most difficult theoretical calculations to the most challenging cosmic measurements,\" added Weinberg. As challenging as the details of Hirata's research are to grasp-even among other physicists-he says that the ultimate purpose of his work is something that anyone can relate to. \"We're made out of normal matter, but only 5 percent of the universe is made of that stuff,\" he explained. \"The rest is what we call dark matter and dark energy, and we don't actually know what it's made of. The universe is expanding, and the expansion is accelerating, and we don't know why. And it's all tied up with the fate of the universe.\" \"It's such a fundamental question: What's going to become of us?\" The Breakthrough Prize ceremony is presented by co-founders Sergey Brin, Yuri Milner and Julia Milner, Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, and Anne Wojcicki, along with Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter. Each year, up to three New Horizons in Physics Prizes are awarded. Hirata is the first winner from Ohio State. The prizes are funded by a grant from the Milner Foundation.

New Horizons' science team has been abuzz since last summer, when the team learned via an occultation of a star by MU69 that this remote and tiny object might be either peanut-shaped or even two objects orbiting one another. In other words, perhaps MU69 is like a binary asteroid. In December, New Horizons science team member Marc Buie of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado offered an update on scientists' thoughts about MU69 at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in New Orleans. He said in a statement: We really won't know what MU69 looks like until we fly past it, or even gain a full understanding of it until after the encounter. But even from afar, the more we examine it, the more interesting and amazing this little world becomes. In particular, data collected during a July 10, 2017 occultation of a star by MU69 has led scientists to suspect MU69 might be binary. Scientists were aboard NASA's airborne Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy - flying over the Pacific Ocean - when they saw what appeared to be a very short drop-out in the star's light prior to the expected occultation. Buie said further analysis of that data, including syncing it with MU69 orbit calculations provided by the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, opens the possibility that the \"blip\" SOFIA detected could be another object orbiting around MU69. Buie commented: A binary with a smaller moon might also help explain the shifts we see in > the position of MU69 during these various occultations. It's all very > suggestive, but another step in our work to get a clear picture of MU69 > before New Horizons flies by a year from now. By the way, the New Horizons team was looking this past fall for your ideas on an informal name for 2014 MU69. The voting is closed now, but the announcement of the winner is expected soon; it wouldn't surprise me if it came today. Meanwhile, you can see the 37 names being considered by the team, and see the results of the voting.

The handlers of NASA's New Horizons spacecraft have just revealed the official patch for the probe's extended mission, which centers on the flyby of a distant and mysterious object called 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019. The newly unveiled design will adorn many New Horizons materials going forward, from PowerPoint presentations to the shirts team members wear on flyby day, said mission principal investigator Alan Stern. \"I think it's cool because it's very '2001'-esque,\" Stern, who's based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com, referring to the classic film \"2001: A Spacey Odyssey.\" \"I think it has a nice sci-fi feel for a sci-fi target.\" The patch shows New Horizons zooming by 2014 MU69, which orbits about 1 billion miles beyond Pluto, in the ring of icy bodies known as the Kuiper Belt. That dwarf planet, of course, was the spacecraft's first flyby target: New Horizons famously got the first-ever up-close looks at Pluto, on July 14, 2015. You can't tell from the patch depiction whether MU69 is a single, multi-lobed object or two separate bodies. That design choice was intentional, Stern said, because either one of those descriptions might be accurate. MU69 is so distant and small - mission team members think it's a maximum of 20 miles wide - that scientists haven't yet managed to nail down its true nature. The patch also shows a number of other small Kuiper Belt objects in the distance - a nod to the fact that New Horizons has been doing long-range investigations of many such bodies during its long cruise to MU69. And Pluto pops up in the design as well, tying the original and extended missions together: The dwarf planet's globe appears at the top of the patch, and New Horizons images of Pluto's terrain fill the border. Oh, and about that border: It's nine-sided, just like the official patch for New Horizons' original Pluto mission. I figured I knew the reason: that, in the eyes of Stern and the rest of the New Horizons team, Pluto is and forever will be the solar system's ninth planet.

The \"pale blue dot.\" NASA That's the gift of perspective that NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft gave us when it sent its iconic \" pale blue dot \" photo. The image, snapped on February 14, 1990, was the last one Voyager shot on its way out of our solar system. Until now, the photo was taken farther away from Earth than any image ever, a record that stood for more than 27 years. But NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has now broken that record, sending back several photos from the Kuiper Belt, a region of the outer Solar System beyond Neptune. New Horizons is exploring this region and the Kuiper Belt Objects found there in an effort to better understand these far-away worlds and the journeys they're making through the cosmos. These objects include dwarf planets like Pluto in far-out orbits of the sun and former KBOs in unstable orbits known as \"Centaurs\". NASA scientists are also using the New Horizons craft to analyze plasma, dust, and gas in the region. New Horizons first broke Voyager's photo-distance record on December 5, 2017, with an image of the \"Wishing Well\" star cluster, which it shot as part of a routine calibration process when it was 3.79 billion miles from Earth. In astronomical units - a measurement of the average distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the Sun - it was 40.9 AUs away. The pale blue dot image, by comparison, was captured 40 AUs from Earth. Several hours after that first image, New Horizons broke its own record with the two images at the top of this story. Each of those show a Kuiper Belt object: The one on the left is known as 2012 HZ84, and on the right is 2012 HE85. These new record-setting images are also the closest-ever images taken of KBOs.

Pronounced ultima thoolee, this name was nominated by more than 40 participants in the campaign, which ran from early November through December 6 of last year. Initially scheduled to end on December 1, the project was extended five days due to high levels of participation. Ultima means \"beyond,\" and Thule is a mythical island in the far north that appears in medieval literature and maps. Together, the name means \"beyond Thule\" and represents the fact that this object, located one billion miles beyond Pluto, will be the most distant one to ever be visited by a spacecraft. It is also the most primitive object to be observed by any probe, composed of pristine materials from the solar system's earliest days. \"MU69 is humanity's next Ultima Thule.

New Horizons was even farther from home than NASA's Voyager 1 when it captured the famous \"Pale Blue Dot\" image of Earth, according to the US space agency. That picture was part of a composite of 60 images looking back at the solar system, on February 14, 1990, when Voyager was 6.06 billion kilometres from Earth.

The distant object, 4 billion miles from Earth, is known by the nickname Ultima Thule. It's a billion miles from Pluto in a part of space known as the Kuiper Belt, which is made up of a mass of icy bodies thought to be leftovers from the dawn of the solar system. When New Horizons flies by Ultima Thule, it will be humanity's first up-close look at this kind of world. But there's a lot of prep work to be done ahead of that flyby.

Overnight on December 31, 2018 - New Year's Eve - New Horizons will fly by, study, and photograph a mysterious object called Ultima Thule. \"IT'S HAPPENING! IT'S HAPPENING! New Horizons is awake after a nearly 6 month hibernation,\" Alan Stern, a planetary scientist who leads the NASA mission, tweeted on Tuesday. \"Flyby preparations for Ultima Thule begin shortly!\" Researchers aren't quite sure of Ultima Thule's exact dimensions. Because it's so dark, at roughly 4 billion miles away, all they have to go on is the shadow it casts in starlight on New Horizon's camera. However, Ultima Thule - formally known to astronomers as 2014 MU69, a mouthful of a name - appears to be a peanut-shaped rock. NASA suspects it's about the size of a metropolis, up to 20 miles long and 12 miles wide. The farthest object ever visited Stern, who recently helped write a book titled \" Chasing New Horizons: Inside the Epic First Mission to Pluto ,\" said Ultima Thule got its name from a Norse phrase that means \"beyond the farthest frontiers.\" If New Horizons' mission to fly by the rock is successful, it will be record- breaking.

The zone might also harbor an as-yet-undiscovered frozen super- Earth. New Horizons is closing in on Ultima Thule at a rate of 760,000 miles a day. After zooming past the rock on New Year's Day, the probe will have vital clues about how our solar system came to be. \"The Kuiper Belt really is an equivalent of an archaeological dig into the history of our solar system,\" Stern said this week on WBUR's \"Here & Now\" radio show. \"Because it's so far away and the sunlight is so weak out there, temperatures are very low - almost absolute zero.

NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, which is speeding on from its 2015 encounter with Pluto to study an object in the distant Kuiper Belt, appears to have detected what scientists are calling an interstellar \"hydrogen wall.\" The space barrier was detected with New Horizons' instrument Alice, a compact ultraviolet imaging telescope and spectrometer. Alice's main goal on the New Horizons mission was to gather information on the atmospheric conditions of Pluto. But scientists are now using Alice to study the edges of the solar system, and the instrument detected an ultraviolet light source in the distance. In a new paper published in Geophysical Research Letters, New Horizons scientists suggest that the light is scattered by a wall of hydrogen. It is \"best explained if the observed ultraviolet light is not only a result of the scattering of sunlight by hydrogen atoms within the solar system, but includes a substantial contribution from a distant source,\" says the paper. More From Popular Mechanics If the mysterious light does in fact come from a hydrogen wall, scientists believe that the wall could be formed by interstellar winds encountering our local solar wind. The New Horizons team plans to continue studying the distant region with Alice about twice a year. \"We assume there's something extra out there, some extra source of brightness,\" co-author Randy Gladstone of the Southwest Research Institute tells Gizmodo. \"If we get a chance with New Horizons we can maybe image it.\" In 2013, the Voyager 1 spacecraft crossed through the barrier of the solar system after flying for almost 40 years, becoming the first human-made object to reach interstellar space. The Voyager data matches up with Alice's, and as the years go on, Alice will get a closer and closer look at this barrier at the edge of the solar system, ultimately reaching interstellar space around 2040. Before it leaves the solar system, though, New Horizons still has plenty of exploring to do. The spacecraft is going to fly near an object known as Ultima Thule -in the Kuiper Belt beyond Pluto-on New Year's Day, 2019. David Grossman David Grossman is a staff writer for PopularMechanics.com.

It orbits nearly 1 billion miles beyond Pluto. Nasa and the New Horizons team chose 2014 MU69 in August as New Horizons' next potential target, thus the nickname PT-1. Like Pluto, MU69 orbits the sun in the frozen, twilight zone known as the Kuiper Belt. This illustration provided by NASA shows the New Horizons spacecraft.

The heliosphere extends from the Sun outward to far beyond Pluto, with the entire region maintained by the solar wind against pressure from hydrogen and helium gases within the Milky Way. Composed of charged particles that stream outward from the Sun, the solar wind inflates a \"bubble\" around the solar system and beyond, up to a distance of approximately 100 AU. There, uncharged hydrogen atoms from interstellar space collide with the solar wind, and, according to some scientists, build up a wall of hydrogen that uniquely scatters ultraviolet light. Thirty years ago, NASA's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft observed a scattering of light that some scientists see as evidence of the hydrogen wall's presence. New Horizons, which used its ultraviolet telescope to search the sky for this hydrogen wall, observed an ultraviolet glow at the solar system's edge that could be proof of the wall's existence even before it flew by Pluto in July 2015. \"We're seeing the threshold between being in the solar neighborhood and being in the galaxy,\" noted New Horizons mission team member Leslie Young of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Between 2007 and 2017, New Horizons scanned the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths seven times, reported Randy Gladstone of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. During this time, the probe observed changes in the ultraviolet light consistent with those seen by the Voyagers approximately 30 years ago. Mission scientists acknowledge the distant ultraviolet light the spacecraft saw could be from a more distant source in the galaxy rather than from the theorized hydrogen wall. \"It's really exciting if these data are able to distinguish the hydrogen wall,\" said David McComas of Princeton University, who did not take part in this study but pointed out that confirmation of the wall's existence would help scientists better understand and constrain the boundary and overall shape of the solar system. After its New Year's Day 2019 flyby of Ultima Thule, its second target, New Horizons will search for evidence of the hydrogen wall approximately twice each year until the mission ends sometime between 10 and 15 years from now, when the spacecraft runs out of fuel. Before that happens, mission scientists are considering a flyby of a third target after Ultima Thule. If the ultraviolet light does not fade during these observations, it likely is coming from further in the galaxy rather than from a hydrogen wall at the heliosphere. A paper on New Horizons' detection of the ultraviolet glow has been published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

It's first objective will be the KBO known as 2014 MU69, which was recently given the nickname Ultima Thule. Earlier this month, the New Horizons spacecraft managed to capture an image of Ultima Thule for the first time using its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager. This came as a bit of a surprise to the mission team, given that the object is still 172 million kilometres away and against a dense background of stars. At its current speed, New Horizons will rendezvous with the object on New Year's Day, 2019. The image was the composite of 48 images taken by the team in their first attempt to find Ultima Thule and a magnified view of the region in the yellow box taken by LORRI. These images were transmitted back to Earth using NASA's Deep Space Network over the next few days. After subtracting the light of the background stars, they were able to see light reflected from Ultima Thule - a KBO which orbits our Sun at a distance of roughly 6.5 billion kilometres. As Hal Weaver, the New Horizons project scientist and LORRI principal investigator from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, explained in a recent NASA press release : > \"The image field is extremely rich with background stars, which makes it > difficult to detect faint objects.

It also indicated that the team already has a good idea of Ultima's orbit since the KBO was precisely where the mission scientists predicted it would be. When the New Horizons mission reaches Ultima, it will be the first time any spacecraft has explored a small object in the Kuiper Belt and will also be the farthest exploration of any body in the Solar System in history. New Horizons already set that record back in July of 2015 when it made its flyby of Pluto, exceeding the previous record by about 1.6 billion km. Speaking of breaking records, these images also broke the previous two records for the most distant image ever taken. Back in December of 2017, New Horizons had already broken that record when it took pictures of the \"Wishing Well\" star cluster at a distance of 6.12 billion kilometres.

The spacecraft would use the Charon gravity assists to visit each of Pluto's moons for close-up observations and even to directly sample the dwarf planet's tenuous atmosphere during low-altitude passes. \"This tour is far from optimised, yet it is capable of making five or more flybys of each of Pluto's four small moons, while examining Pluto's polar and equatorial regions using plane changes,\" said Tiffany Finley, who designed the orbital tour. \"The plan also allows for an extensive up-close encounter with Charon before dipping into Pluto's atmosphere for sampling before the craft uses Charon one last time to escape into the Kuiper Belt for new assignments.\" Stern said the Southwest Research Institute study proves a single spacecraft can both explore the Pluto system in detail as well as carry out multiple observations in the Kuiper Belt. \"Who would have thought that a single mission using already available electric propulsion engines could do all this?\" said Stern. \"Now that our team has shown that the planetary science community doesn't have to choose between a Pluto orbiter or flybys of other bodies in the Kuiper Belt, but can have both, I call this combined mission the 'gold standard' for future Pluto and Kuiper Belt exploration.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2018/10/25/as-new-horizons-closes-in-on-ultima-thule-scientists-propose-a-pluto-orbiter/"}, {"title": "NASA news: New Horizons closes in on asteroid more than FOUR BILLION miles from Earth", "date": "2018-12-11", "content": "The New Horizons spacecraft is set to kick off the new year in spectacular fashion as it will make its first flyby of Ultima Thule - a 25 kilometre wide asteroid located in the Kuiper Belt - on January 1.

New Horizons' principal investigator, Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told The Sunday Times: \"The Ultima flyby will be the first-ever close-up exploration of a small Kuiper Belt object and the farthest exploration of any planetary body in history.\" The spaceship will be just 2,200 miles from the asteroid, which is impressive considering it was spotted from 4.03 billion kilometres away by the Kepler Telescope. New Horizons is now closing in on the asteroid, which has space boffins at NASA excited.

New Horizons will make its closest approach to the Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69, nicknamed Ultima Thule, at 12:33 a.m. Eastern Jan. 1. The spacecraft will pass 3,500 kilometers from the small body, 6.6 billion kilometers from the Earth, at a speed of 14 kilometers per second. Controllers transmitted a \"knowledge update\" to New Horizons early Dec. 30, changing the timing of events during the flyby by two seconds to reflect improved knowledge of the position of Ultima Thule relative to the spacecraft. That will likely be the final update prior to the flyby, said Alice Bowman, New Horizons mission operations manager, during a briefing at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory here Dec. 30. New Horizons itself is in good condition, with no sign of any problems that could hinder the flyby. \"The spacecraft is healthy,\" she said. When the spacecraft transmits a confirmation that the update was successfully applied, \"we'll probably breathe a huge sigh of relief.\" Bowman tweeted late Dec. 30 that the update was indeed successfully installed on the spacecraft. Scientists involved with the mission were excited about the science they expect New Horizons to return, but not nervous about the flyby itself. \"A lot of my calmness reflects the fact that the mission is operating just as we expect it to. There's no indication of anything anomalous,\" said Jeff Moore, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center who leads the part of the New Horizons science team devoted to geology and geophysics investigations. \"The most recent knowledge update puts us in a very good position to get some really beautiful pictures.\" The biggest challenge in the days leading up to the flyby have not been technical but instead bureaucratic. The partial government shutdown that started Dec. 22 when funding lapsed for some government agencies, including NASA, threw a wrench into plans developed months earlier for publicizing the event. NASA's shutdown plan states that the agency's website and social media will not be updated during the shutdown, and that NASA Television will also be offline. However, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said Dec. 27 that NASA TV and social media accounts would continue to operate during the flyby because the contract supporting that work was \"forward funded\" prior to the shutdown. APL also made plans to broadcast briefings about the flyby on its own social media accounts and website. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for New Horizons, said Dec. 30 that because of the shutdown NASA officials who previously planned to attend the flyby can't do so in an official capacity, including appearing at media events or making statements. \"Other than that we are essentially unaffected,\" he said, adding that those officials are welcome to attend the flyby events as private citizens. A few science team members who are NASA civil servants had to get exceptions from the furlough that affects about 95 percent the agency's workforce \"because this is a critical operation,\" Stern said. Among them was Moore, who said he and another Ames scientist, Dale Cruikshank, needed to \"deal with the bureaucracy\" in order to get excepted from the furlough and permission to travel to APL for the flyby. \"We both spent a day filling out paperwork and dealing with the system,\" he said. Moore and other scientists are looking forward to the expected seven gigabytes of data that New Horizons will collect during the flyby, including images, spectra and particle data about Ultima Thule. While a few images and other data will be returned in the days following the flyby, it will take the spacecraft about 20 months to transmit all the data it collected because of its extreme distance from the Earth. New Horizons will be out of contact with the Earth during the flyby itself. It will transmit some data collected prior to the close approach Dec. 31. After the close approach it will transmit 15 minutes of telemetry that Bowman described as a \"burst of health and safety data,\" including the amount of data collected. That is expected to arrive on Earth at 10:29 a.m. Eastern Jan. 1. The spacecraft will start returning data collected during the flyby later Jan. 1. Ultima Thule is considered part of a family of Kuiper Belt objects called \"cold classicals.\" The \"cold\" in the name refers not to their temperature but the fact that they have orbits with low inclination and eccentricity, said Hal Weaver, New Horizons project scientist, suggesting they have not been perturbed or modified since the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. \"It's probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft,\" he said of Ultima Thule. \"It's the best possible relic of the solar system's formation out at those distances.\" \"The Kuiper Belt is just a scientific wonderland. It is the location where we have the best-preserved samples from the formation era of our solar system,\" Stern said. \"From a scientific standpoint there's nothing like this.\" Scientists are also excited about the flyby because so little is known about Ultima Thule, discovered only in 2014 as they looked for potential targets for an extended mission for New Horizons after its July 2015 flyby of Pluto. The object, no more than 30 kilometers across, has only been seen by the Hubble Space Telescope and New Horizons itself. \"We don't know a thing about MU69,\" said Stern. \"We've never, in the history of spaceflight, gone to a target that we knew less about.\" Among those uncertainties is the rotational period of the object. Scientists had hoped to determine how fast Ultima Thule spins around its axis by looking for a pattern in brightness variations of the object over time, known as a lightcurve. However, observations of the object so far have revealed a flat lightcurve, making it difficult to discern a rotation period. Weaver said there's \"some hint\" in the lightcurve data they have that the spacecraft rotates quickly, on the order of several hours. \"The little bit that we've been able to tease out suggests that it may be rotating pretty quickly, but we've been up and down on the team as to whether or not we believe that,\" he said. Weaver said the most likely explanation of the lack of a lightcurve is that New Horizons is looking directly down the rotation axis of Ultima Thule, so that it looks at the same part of the object all the time. However, there are alternative explanations. Marc Buie, who led the team that observed stellar occultations in July 2017 and August 2018 when Ultima Thule passed in front of a star, said an unusual shape of the object could explain the flat lightcurve. While those occultations indicated that the object may have two lobes, an object with three lobes could also produce a flat lightcurve. Given enough time to develop models, Buie said he could likely come up with a shape for Ultima Thule that explains the lightcurve. But the spacecraft will soon provide its own answers, he added. \"Why not just wait until we get pictures?\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/new-horizons-ready-for-ultima-thule-flyby/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "New Horizons survived its flyby of Ultima Thule", "date": "2019-01-01", "content": "New Horizons successfully \"phoned home\" at 10:28 a.m. EST, letting NASA scientists know all of its systems survived the flyby of Ultima Thule. The first real images will now slowly trickle in over the coming hours and days. \"We have a healthy spacecraft,\" Mission Operations Manager, \"MOM,\" Alice Bowman announced to a crowd of cheering scientists Tuesday morning. Not long after the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day, as 2018 gave way to 2019, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew by the far-out space rock Ultima Thule. At 12:33 am EST this morning, the craft passed within 2,200 miles (3,540 km) of the Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), formally known as 2014 MU69. This was the farthest object that any craft has ever visited. Now, New Horizons will beam the first information and images from this close flyby back to Earth. However, seeing as the exploratory spacecraft is about four billion miles (6.6 billion km) from our home planet, this data takes a while to travel back to Earth. In fact, it takes more than six hours for radio signals carrying information from New Horizons to deliver the data to NASA's Deep Space Network. At 10:28 am EST today, New Horizons made its pre-programmed \"phone home,\" letting the mission team back on Earth know that the craft completed the flyby unharmed. This call didn't include any information about the object, but later today the first science data and imagery of the far-out space rock will be available. At 11:35 a.m. EST, NASA held a press conference to update the spacecraft status, including the latest images and data download schedule. The team released an image taken before the flyby while the spacecraft was still some one million miles from Ultima Thule. \"It's a better pixelated blob than the day before,\" said New Horizons Project Scientist Hal Weaver. The grainy image reveals Ultima Thule is shaped something like a spinning bowling pin. The first science data taken during the flyby will arrive tonight. This will be followed by more scientific data and higher-resolution images over the next few hours and days. The very highest color images won't arrive until February, but the team expects to have a good idea of what Ultima Thule looks like this week. Overnight tonight, official say the first high-resolution science data should arrive and scientists will begin analyzing the information. An even better image should be released on January 2. New Horizons was set to take a total of 900 highest-resolution images throughout the flyby and the mission team will know in time how many of those images clearly show Ultima Thule. All in all, New Horizons will collect 50 gigabits of data, as compared to the 55 gigabits collected at Pluto. \"We're going to start writing our first scientific paper next week,\" said the Southwest Research Institute's Alan Stern, the New Horizons team leader.

Its remarkable appearance, unlike anything we've seen before, illuminates the processes that built the planets four and a half billion years ago. \"This flyby is a historic achievement,\" said New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \"Never before has any spacecraft team tracked down such a small body at such high speed so far away in the abyss of space. New Horizons has set a new bar for state-of-the-art spacecraft navigation.\" The new images - taken from as close as 17,000 miles on approach - revealed Ultima Thule as a \"contact binary,\" consisting of two connected spheres. End to end, the world measures 19 miles in length. The team has dubbed the larger sphere \"Ultima\" and the smaller sphere \"Thule\". The team says that the two spheres likely joined as early as 99% of the way back to the formation of the solar system, colliding no faster than two cars in a fender-bender. \"New Horizons is like a time machine, taking us back to the birth of the solar system. We are seeing a physical representation of the beginning of planetary formation, frozen in time,\" said Jeff Moore, New Horizons Geology and Geophysics team lead. \"Studying Ultima Thule is helping us understand how planets form - both those in our own solar system and those orbiting other stars in our galaxy.\" Data from the New Year's Day flyby will continue to arrive over the next weeks and months, with much higher resolution images yet to come. \"In the coming months, New Horizons will transmit dozens of data sets to Earth, and we'll write new chapters in the story of Ultima Thule - and the solar system,\" said Helene Winters, New Horizons Project Manager.

So, What's Next?", "date": "2019-01-02", "content": "NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has completed its epic flyby of the most distant object ever explored, the recently-unveiled fossil from the beginning of the solar system, Ultima Thule. So what's next? Although the Jan. 1 encounter is over, the mission is far from finished. New Horizons still has images of Ultima Thule to send back, more of the Kuiper Belt to study, and the hope of one day leaving the solar system completely. With the spacecraft safely past its target, a primary concern is its condition. After all, it can't send home data if it isn't functioning. Fortunately, health doesn't currently appear to be an issue. \"Everything looks great,\" Mission Operation Manager Alice Bowman told the press after the flyby. \"We're definitely looking forward to getting down the science data so all of our scientists-and the world - can see what the origins of our solar system has to hold for us.\" An extensive process Ultima Thule, a Kuiper Belt object 4 billion miles from Earth, is seen by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft on Dec. 31, 2018, just hours before the probe's flyby closest approach on Jan. 1, 2019. It is the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft. During its fleeting pass over Ultima Thule, New Horizons filled its hard drive with about 7 gigabytes of data about the tiny Kuiper Belt Object. With the observations complete, it must begin the arduous task of sending that data back home. But before New Horizons can dig into the process, the spacecraft will be temporarily silenced by the sun. For a few brief days, from Jan. 4 to 9, the sun's atmosphere will block transmissions from New Horizons back to Earth. During that time, the science team will disperse, returning to their homes for a few days of downtime. As soon as spacecraft clears the sun, the researchers will return to consuming each day's new data, working remotely in several small teams and meeting back together again at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland on Jan. 15. They won't be hanging around Maryland the whole time, however. At about 1,000 bits per second, it will take roughly 20 months to send home all of the newly- collected data about Ultima Thule. Eventually, they'll head home again, meeting remotely and occasionally in person to discuss their discoveries. The arrival of the images and information is highly prioritized, according to principle investigator Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado. \"Even though the spacecraft has performed perfectly now for almost 13 years, there's always the chance that something could go amiss,\" Stern told the press after the flyby. Information about the highest priority objectives, such as the geology and composition, as well as the potential for rings or moons, will be beamed home first. Secondary goals pertaining to dust escape, craters, and physical surface properties will take second string. Only once that information has been sent back will the lowest-priority and bonus objectives related to more detailed properties of any rings and moons, information about the mass and density, and extra compositional studies return to Earth. The first few downlinks will contain a little bit of everything. \"We want to get data sets from each of the instruments on the ground,\" Bowman said. According to Bowman, although Ultima Thule is much smaller, New Horizons is collecting roughly the same amount of data as it retrieved at Pluto. But Ultima Thule is more than a billion miles farther from Earth than Pluto, so it takes even longer for the information to travel home. All of it is relayed by a 15-watt radio transmitter whose weak signal is directed at Earth. \"I am in awe that we can even do this,\" Stern said about the communication process. Extending the mission. After buzzing Pluto in 2015, New Horizons began an extended mission, the highlight being the Ultima Thule flyby. But that's not the only goal of the spacecraft's next phase. It will continue to study the Kuiper Belt, the band of ice and rocks that makes up the third zone of the solar system, until at least April 2021 when its current mission funding ends. The team is already looking towards a hyperextended mission. \"We expect to have plenty of fuel left when we finish Ultima Thule,\" Project Scientist Hal Weaver said before the flyby. \"We'd like to try to find another KBO along the way.\" The Kuiper Belt stretches from about 30 to about 55 astronomical units, and Ultima Thule is smack in the middle of it. An AU is the distance between Earth and the sun. According to Stern, New Horizons will be in the Kuiper Belt until 2027 or 2028. \"It would be silly not to look for another target,\" Stern said. The hunt might prove to be more difficult than originally anticipated. While New Horizons was on its way to Pluto, the researchers spent years combing the sky with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope before finally finding three potential targets, finally selecting Ultima Thule because it was the closest. The lonely object lies in the most heavily populated region of the Kuiper Belt. According to Weaver, Ultima Thule is the faintest KBO ever observed, in part because it lies so far away. The next target will orbit even farther out, making it potentially even fainter and harder to see from Earth. The best telescope for discovering the next target might be New Horizons itself. Weaver said that it might be possible to modify the flight software so that the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager, the spacecraft's camera, could be used as a discovery device for finding KBOs along New Horizons' path. LORRI could take hundreds or even thousands of photographs of the stars around the spacecraft. Rather than send those images back to Earth, it might be possible to program the computer to search for the best targets and only send home those images. Weaver said that such plans are still on the drawing board. But the team won't immediately begin stressing about their next mission. According to Stern, they won't submit a proposal for the next extended mission until the summer of 2020. In the meantime, they will hunt for New Horizons next target. \"I'm relatively optimistic,\" Stern said. Say goodbye. When New Horizons flew past Ultima Thule, it zoomed by at 32,000 mph. With these speeds, the spacecraft will be able to break free from the sun's gravitational pull and travel beyond the solar system, like NASA's Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft. When that will happen remains a mystery. The boundary between the heliosphere, the region that surrounds the sun, and the interstellar medium, the region between the stars, changes with the 11-year solar cycle. That makes it difficult to predict where it will be in 20 years, Stern told Space.com in the weeks before the flyby. New Horizons should hold onto power until around the late 2030s, Stern said, when it will be just past 100 AUs from the sun. The boundary could be anywhere from 70 to 130 AUs in the most extreme cases. \"No model can predict whether we can see interstellar space before we run out of power,\" Stern said. But he thinks there's a good chance that the spacecraft will still have power when it crosses the ever-changing boundary. That would be an excellent thing for science. Although both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have instruments that have been measuring ISM particles, Stern said that New Horizon carries not one but two more powerful instruments. With these instruments, the spacecraft could make more accurate measurements than its predecessors. In addition, New Horizons has the Student Dust Counter, which currently holds the record for the most distant working dust detector in space. \"Putting a dust detector in the ISM would be a very valuable experience,\" Stern said. New Horizons will leave the solar system whether it targets another KBO or remains on its present course, he said. Whether New Horizons extends its mission or continues straight on from Ultima Thule, its scientists are excited to see the new images the spacecraft will be delivering down the road. \"It just keeps getting better and better,\" Weaver said.

Analyzing photos from the probe's flyby of Pluto and Charon, scientists have discovered a surprising lack of small objects in the belt. The photographs revealed few small craters on Charon -- by default, that indicates a lack of small impactors. Based on analyzing these craters, the researchers believe, most objects in the Kuiper Belt are larger than 300 feet to 1 mile in diameter, which qualifies as small in this case. As New Horizons sends back images of Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69, this discovery by Southwest Research Institute-led scientists provides even more information about the belt's composition.

One of 10 mission studies funded by NASA for the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, its goal is to send an unmanned spacecraft to make a two-year study to the dwarf planet as well as two other Kuiper Belt Objects. When NASA's New Horizons deep-space probe flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015, it revolutionized our knowledge of the dwarf planet and its five moons before going on to encounter Kuiper Belt Object 2014 MU69. Unfortunately, since it was traveling at a velocity of 14 km/sec, it was only in the vicinity of Pluto for a few hours, so there are still major gaps in our knowledge - not the least of which is that New Horizons wasn't able to map the planet's entire surface. Now, NASA is considering a longer-term visit with a single, nuclear-powered probe going into orbit around Pluto for two years before heading on to study two other KBOs. Though the details of the new craft are sketchy, it would have a larger payload than New Horizons and more advanced instruments more suitable for an orbital mission. In addition, the goal of visiting other KBOs suggests that it will include some sort of ion drive.

The results of the study are expected to be delivered at the National Academy Planetary Decadal Study in 2020. \"In an SwRI-funded study that preceded this new NASA-funded study, we developed a Pluto system orbital tour, showing the mission was possible with planned capability launch vehicles and existing electric propulsion systems,\" said SwRI's Dr. Alan Stern, principal investigator of the New Horizons mission and the SwRI-funded study. \"We also showed it is possible to use gravity assists from Pluto's largest moon, Charon, to escape Pluto orbit and to go back into the Kuiper Belt for the exploration of more KBOs like MU69 and at least once more dwarf planet for comparison to Pluto.\" ", "url": "https://newatlas.com/space/nasa-commissions-plan-for-pluto-orbital-mission/"}, {"title": "New Horizons may reach termination shock sooner than expected", "date": "2019-12-03", "content": "An instrument aboard NASA's New Horizons is sending back data that could help scientists predict when the unmanned deep-space probe will reach interstellar space. Using the Solar Wind Around Pluto instrument aboard the spacecraft, a team of researchers led by Southwest Research Institute are learning more about how the solar winds change in the outer regions of the solar system. Though the solar system may look like a big ball of nuclear fire at the center surrounded by a scattering of tiny, solid objects sitting in a lot of very hard vacuum, all that nothingness is permeated by the solar winds - an unceasing flow of ionized particles from the Sun that forms an uneven bubble around our family of planets called the heliosphere. The outer limit of the heliosphere is where it encounters materials from interstellar space. This is the point where the solar wind slow down to subsonic speeds due to interacting and then is stopped altogether by the interstellar medium. These two points are called, respectively, the termination shock and the heliopause. The SWAP instrument aboard NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has confirmed that the solar wind slows as it travels farther from the Sun Pat Gonzales/ Southwest Research Institute To measure the interaction between the solar and the interstellar, New Horizons is equipped with the SWAP instrument. Though Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2 have all been out this far, none were carrying such a sophisticated device that can make detailed, daily measurements of the solar wind, and especially \"interstellar pickup ions.\" These are stray neutral atoms wandering in from cosmic space, which are then ionized by sunlight. According to Southwest Research Institute, SWAP can measure low fluxes of interstellar pickup ions with unprecedented time resolution and extensive spatial coverage. Currently about 46 astronomical units from the Sun, New Horizons is at a distance where scientists expect the solar wind to start to noticeably slow down and heat up as it encounters and interacts with interstellar material. According to the Southwest Research Institute team, SWAP has confirmed that this is actually happening. For the purposes of the study, the researchers looked at solar wind speed measurements from a distance of 21 to 42 AU using SWAP and compared them to measurements from NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft at one AU. What they found was that at 21 AU, SWAP detected a slowing of the solar wind and by the time it reached 42 AU, New Horizons saw the winds drop by up to seven percent slower than those registered at 1 AU. This not only gave new insights into the far regions of the solar system but may also help to estimate when New Horizons will reach interstellar space by using the changes in solar wind temperature and density to estimate where the solar wind slows to below Mach one - ie. the termination shock. The reason why the SWAP data is needed is that this point varies with the level of solar activity. Since the Sun is at a very low level of activity at the moment, the termination shock is closer to the Sun, so New Horizons is currently closer to it. However, the spacecraft isn't scheduled to reach that point until the middle of the next decade, so the termination shock may move farther out if the Sun goes into an active period - perhaps as much as far as 94 AU. \"Previously, only the Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyager 1 and 2 missions have explored the outer solar system and outer heliosphere, but now New Horizons is doing that with more modern scientific instruments,\" says Heather Elliott, Deputy Principal Investigator of the SWAP instrument. \"Our Sun's influence on the space environment extends well beyond the outer planets, and SWAP is showing us new aspects of how that environment changes with distance.\" ", "url": "https://newatlas.com/space/new-horizons-reach-solar-system-termination-shock-sooner/"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "5 years after its Pluto flyby, New Horizons spacecraft forges ahead", "date": "2020-07-15", "content": "When NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto five years ago this week, it captured detailed views of the mysterious icy dwarf planet on the edge of our solar system. Since then, data gathered about Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, have been used to gain insight about these planetary bodies 4 billion miles away from Earth. New Horizons launched in January 2006 and reached Pluto in July 2015, flying within 7,800 miles of Pluto's surface. The stunning images shared by New Horizons showed both \" Earth-like characteristics \" on the surface as well as alien landscapes and geology not seen anywhere else in our solar system. And rather than being a quiet, frozen dwarf planet, data gathered by New Horizons revealed that Pluto is actually very active. New Horizons has entirely changed the way scientists understand Pluto and data from the mission is continuing to help researchers unravel secrets about the distant dwarf planet, as well as icy objects orbiting along the edge of our solar system. \"New Horizons transformed Pluto from a fuzzy, telescopic dot into a living world with stunning diversity and surprising complexity,\" said Hal Weaver in a statement. Weaver is the New Horizons project scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, which designed, built and operates the spacecraft. \"The Pluto encounter was exploration at its finest, a real tribute to the vision and persistence of the New Horizons team,\" he said. New Horizons' revelations Pluto is tiny but mighty, smaller than our moon and only about 1,400 miles wide, or half the width of the United States. Charon, the largest of Pluto's five moons, is so similar in size to Pluto that they orbit each other like a double planet system. If you were to stand on the surface of Pluto, which has an average temperature of negative 387 degrees Fahrenheit, you would see blue skies, red snow and mountains that tower like the Rockies, according to NASA. New Horizons also revealed the strange mechanics of Pluto's \"beating\" heart-shaped glacier, similar in size to Texas, that explain the planet's exaggerated tilt and even helps drive the wind on Pluto. The heart-shaped feature is known as Tombaugh Regio, named in honor of astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930. Much of the dwarf planet's nitrogen ice content can be found in this region, concentrated in a deep basin called Sputnik Planitia because the elevation is 1.9 miles lower than the surface. The ice sheet spans 620 miles. The basin makes up the \"left lobe\" of the heart, while the right side is home to nitrogen glaciers and highlands. In daytime, Pluto's frozen nitrogen heart warms enough to become vapor. By night, it's condensing and turning to ice again. The researchers call this Pluto's \"heartbeat,\" which controls atmospheric circulation of nitrogen winds around the planet. Some scientists also believe there is a liquid ocean beneath Pluto's ice shell that is estimated to be 249 miles thick. But they thought it formed later in Pluto's history as radioactive elements were heated near the dwarf planet's rocky core and decayed. This heat could have been enough to melt ice and form a subsurface ocean. But New Horizons data suggested otherwise. New research based on that data has suggested that Pluto actually started out in a hot formation scenario. In that scenario, the liquid ocean would slowly freeze over time, although not completely, and cause the extensional faults seen by New Horizons in Pluto's icy crust. When Pluto's frozen heart beats, it creates wind This long, slow freeze of the subsurface ocean could also explain the mix of features on Pluto's surface because expansion would occur throughout the history of the dwarf planet. New Horizons' images of Pluto and Charon also revealed pock-marked surfaces. They're covered in large craters. The craters reveal that small Kuiper Belt objects less than 100 kilometers in size probably created them when they collided with Pluto and Charon. And because of what scientists know about impact crater formation, the fact that no craters were found smaller than 13 kilometers in diameter means there are fewer Kuiper Belt objects smaller than 2 kilometers than astronomers had predicted. This provides more support for the idea that Kuiper Belt objects are not pieces of space rock formed from collisions but actual intact \"leftovers\" from when the solar system was forming billions of years ago. Pluto also has other surprising features, such as dunes. But these aren't like sand dunes on Earth; Pluto's dunes are made from solid methane ice grains and sculpted by the wind. Within our solar system, dunes are rarer than you might think. They exist only on Earth, Mars, Venus, Saturn's moon Titan and Comet 67P. These dunes are largely undisturbed on Pluto's icy crust, which suggested that they were formed within the past 500,000 years - or even more recently. Pluto presents a bit of an age conundrum this way. The dwarf planet has polygonal shapes and features that indicate the surface is geologically active and young. The surface itself is only about 500,000 years old, although the dwarf planet itself is about 4.5 billion years old. This activity is most likely caused by a thermal, convective overturning of the ice. These are only a few of the discoveries made using data provided by New Horizons and even more will be made in the future as scientists work through the wealth of information provided by the flyby. \"It's clear to me that the solar system saved the best for last!\" said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado, in a statement. \"We could not have explored a more fascinating or scientifically important planet at the edge of our solar system. The New Horizons team worked for 15 years to plan and execute this flyby and Pluto paid us back in spades!\" What's next In January 2019, New Horizons conducted the first flyby of a distant Kuiper Belt Object, which has since been named Arrokoth, allowing researchers to study these remnants of solar system formation in detail. New Horizons continues to explore the outer reaches of our solar system, sharing its unique view of the stars billions of miles away from Earth. Meanwhile, it's receiving some scouting help from an Earth-based telescope. The Subaru Telescope, located on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. It's helping to search for potential target candidates for New Horizons to observe next. \"We are using the Subaru Telescope because it is the best in the world for our search purposes,\" Stern said. \"This is due to its unique combination of telescope size - one of the very largest anywhere, and Hyper Suprime-Cam's wide field of view - which can discover many Kuiper Belt objects at once.\" Currently, Subaru is observing an area in the Sagittarius constellation, where New Horizons is located. The Subaru observation team expects to find hundreds of new Kuiper Belt Objects, with 50 that should be at the right distance from New Horizons to be observed. They may find another one that is perfectly situated for a flyby, such as Arrokoth.

On Saturday at 8:42 p.m. EDT, New Horizons will reach 50 AU from the sun - or 50 times the distance the Earth is from the sun. That is 4.65 billion miles. At 50 AU, it takes more than 6.5 hours for signals sent from New Horizons to reach Earth, and that is while traveling at the speed of light. \"I just think of the enormity of it,\" Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in an interview with collectSPACE. \"It hasn't been done in a generation, since the Voyagers crossed these distances, and we're the only spacecraft out there in the outer heliosphere and the Kuiper Belt.\" New Horizons is the fifth most distant spacecraft from Earth. Pioneer 10, which was launched in 1972 and was the first probe to pass through the asteroid belt and to fly by Jupiter, reached 50 AU on Sept. 22, 1990. Today, it is approximately 129 AU from Earth. Its sister ship, Pioneer 11, reached 50 AU a year later in 1991. It was launched in 1973 and in addition to flying by Jupiter, was the first to make direct observations of Saturn. It is now about 105 AU from Earth. NASA launched Voyager 1 on Sept. 5, 1977, 16 days after its twin, Voyager 2. Voyager 1 studied Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2 also encountered Uranus and Neptune. Voyager 1 today is 152 AU from Earth. Voyager 2 is at 127 AU. While Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 ceased operations years ago, both Voyagers remain active today. The Pioneers and the Voyagers are so far out today that none of them are the nearest probe to New Horizons. NASA's Juno spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, is at this point closer. \"In the very distant future, we will be so far from everybody else that we will be closer to the Voyagers and the Pioneers, but we will never pass them because three of the four are going faster than us,\" said Stern. \"Right now, we are almost 100 AU from Voyager 1.\" To underscore how far Voyager 1 had traveled, NASA pointed the probe's camera back toward the inner solar system in 1990 when it was approximately 40.11 AU from Earth. The resulting mosaic image, now known as the \"Family Portrait,\" captured six planets - Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus - as just a few pixels of light each. At 50 AU from the sun, New Horizons could not do the same. \"The math tells us that would burn out our camera because we would be pointed at the sun,\" Stern said, noting that even at such great a distance, the sun remains too bright for its long-range reconnaissance imager, which was calibrated for the dimly lit encounter with Pluto. \"So we don't want to do that until we are past the Kuiper Belt years from now.\" Instead, Stern and his team pointed New Horizons toward Voyager 1, marking the first time that a spacecraft in the Kuiper Belt photographed the location of an even more distant spacecraft now traveling through interstellar space. \"Of course, we didn't see Voyager 1 because it is too faint, but we imaged the star field,\" Stern told collectSPACE. \"We looked with the camera to where the farthest spacecraft is and took a picture of that star field from our position in the Kuiper Belt. It is just hauntingly beautiful to me, even though it is just a picture of stars.\" \"This is an homage to Voyager's pioneering mission, in addition to marking what we are doing,\" he said. More than just a round number milestone, reaching 50 AU means that everything New Horizons does now is exceeding its planned design lifespan. \"One of the first things you do when designing a spacecraft is set requirements and one we had to set was what the maximum distance was we were designing the spacecraft to operate at,\" said Stern. \"Now, you always build in margins so you can do better, but we had to have some number so if we crossed that goal line, we could declare victory - that the spacecraft had met its design objectives.\" \"That goal line was 50 AU,\" said Stern. New Horizons flew by Pluto, returning the first close-up look at the world and its moons, in July 2015, when the spacecraft was 39.2 AU from the sun. Four years later on New Year's Day 2019, New Horizons made the farthest flyby in history, capturing the first close-up observations of a Kuiper Belt object at a distance of 43.4 AU from the sun. \"We're still getting data back from that flyby,\" said Stern. \"Meanwhile, as we fly across the Kuiper Belt, we're doing three other things: we're studying the heliospheric environment, the plasma, the dust and the gas; we're studying other Kuiper Belt objects, we know have more than 30 that we have observed in ways you cannot from Earth or from any other spacecraft; and we're using the Subaru telescope in Hawaii, which is one fo the largest telescopes in the world, to find new Kuiper Belt objects to study and hoping we find a flyby target because we still have fuel in the tank and are capable of doing another flyby.\" The hope is to find another target before New Horizons runs out of power. Though it draws its electricity from a nuclear battery, its plutonium power supply generates 33 watts less every decade. By the late 2030s, when New Horizons will be at or near 100 AU from the sun, it may be too low on power to operate. Even if New Horizons does not make it to 100 AU, Stern is impressed with how far the mission has gone and even more so with how much its team has been able to achieve. \"When the Voyagers flew, their team was 450 people. New Horizons is doing this on about 50 bellybuttons, so about 10 times smaller,\" he said. \"When I think about what our team has accomplished over these 15 years with one spacecraft and no backup, going all the way out there to study Pluto for the first time, the Kuiper Belt for the first time and now pass the 50 AU marker where it was designed to be its maximum distance, it just sounds like science fiction to me,\" said Stern. \"I have to pinch myself that this group of people were actually able to do this thing, it is so much larger than life.\" ", "url": "http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-041521a-new-horizons-50-au-voyager-photo.html"}, {"title": "NASA's New Horizons delivers poignant image as it nears space milestone", "date": "2021-04-16", "content": "Voyagers 1 and 2. Pioneers 10 and 11. Those historic spacecraft are about to welcome a new member to an elite club. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft will reach a distance of 50 astronomical units from the sun on Saturday, April 17. That's 50 times farther from the sun than Earth is. After New Horizons launched in 2006, it was able to communicate with Earth in mere minutes. Now, at a distance of nearly 5 billion miles (7.5 billion kilometers) away, it takes about 14 hours round trip for confirmation it's received instructions from home.  New Horizons won't get to learn a secret handshake, but NASA did figure out an appropriate way to celebrate the milestone. The space agency had New Horizons snap an image in the direction of Voyager 1, the first spacecraft to leave the solar system. New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern called it \"a hauntingly beautiful image.\" New Horizons is still well within our solar system, and it has accomplished a lot already. It famously stopped off at Pluto to capture images and study the dwarf planet. It's now exploring the Kuiper Belt, a region of space filled with icy objects that extends beyond Neptune's orbit. \"Flying a spacecraft across our entire solar system to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt had never been done before New Horizons,\" Stern said. \"Most of us on the team have been a part of this mission since it was just an idea, and during that time our kids have grown up, and our parents, and we ourselves, have grown older.\" NASA expects New Horizons' battery to power it into the late-2030s.

On April 17, 2021, New Horizons became the fifth human-made object to reach this rare space milestone. The spacecraft broke the 50 AU mark on its trek out of the solar system, nearly six years after its successful sweep past Pluto in July 2015. NASA described the current distance of New Horizons from our sun in this way: Here's one way to imagine just how far 50 AU is: Think of the solar system laid out on a neighborhood street; the sun is one house to the left of 'home', Mars would be the next house to the right, and Jupiter would be just four houses to the right. New Horizons would be 50 houses down the street, 17 houses beyond Pluto! In other words, it's far away. Why? Because space is vast! Get an idea of how vast by visiting the interactive diagram of solar system distances at If the Moon Were Only 1 Pixel. Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are the only other spacecraft that have traveled farther than 50 AU from our sun. This distance equals about 5 billion miles. When scientists on Earth send a command to New Horizons, it requires seven hours to reach the distant spacecraft, traveling at the speed of light. Then the scientists must wait another seven hours to know if the message was received. One message the scientists sent to New Horizons, in late 2020, was a request to photograph one of its predecessors. On Christmas Day 2020, New Horizons pointed its camera in the direction of Voyager 1, the first spacecraft to cross the 50 AU mark. The remarkable image, seen below, does not capture the figure of Voyager 1 itself, of course. Voyager 1 is 11.2 billion miles farther away than New Horizons, but it is the first image taken by a spacecraft in the Kuiper Belt of a more distant spacecraft. Voyager 1 is now an amazing 152 AU from the sun and has officially left the bounds of the solar system as it journeys through interstellar space. New Horizons will reach our solar system's \"border\" and cross into interstellar space in the 2040s, as it flies outward into territory no longer dominated by our sun. Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, commented on the image of Voyager 1: That's a hauntingly beautiful image to me. Looking back at the flight of New Horizons from Earth to 50 AU almost seems in some way like a dream. Flying a spacecraft across our entire solar system to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt had never been done before New Horizons. Most of us on the team have been a part of this mission since it was just an idea, and during that time our kids have grown up, and our parents, and we ourselves, have grown older. But most importantly, we made many scientific discoveries, inspired countless STEM careers, and even made a little history. While New Horizons won't exactly catch up to and meet Voyager 1, it is the fastest human-made object ever launched from Earth. New Horizons got an additional boost with a gravity- assist flyby of Jupiter in February 2007. While it was at Jupiter, it took the best views ever of Jupiter's faint ring and captured the first movie of a volcano erupting beyond Earth. After its enormously successful exploration of Pluto, delivering amazing photos that changed the way we view the petite world, it continued traveling outward, giving us the first close-up look at a Kuiper Belt object, Arrokoth, in 2019. But New Horizons may not be done yet. It has enough power in its nuclear battery to continue operating until the late 2030s. It just needs a new object to target.

New Horizons is still on duty in extended mission mode, diving ever deeper into the Kuiper Belt to examine ancient, icy mini-worlds in that vast region beyond the orbit of Neptune. New Horizons launched in January 2006 and carried out a reconnaissance study of Pluto and its moons in the summer of 2015, culminating in a close flyby of the dwarf planet on July 14, 2015. That encounter revealed Pluto to be an incredibly diverse world, complete with towering water-ice mountains and huge plains of exotic nitrogen ice. But the nuclear-powered probe kept its eyes open even after Pluto wa. Primitive object New Horizons next flew by Arrokoth, a small Kuiper Belt object, on Jan. 1, 2019. Arrokoth, which the New Horizons science team discovered in 2014 using the Hubble Space Telescope, is the most distant and most primitive object ever explored up close by a spacecraft. And there could be another flyby in New Horizons' future as well. At a meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group in June, New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, related that both the spacecraft and its scientific payload are entirely healthy. The probe's lifetime is presently limited only by its nuclear fuel supply, which is likely sufficient to keep New Horizons flying through 2040. And NASA recently granted another mission extension for New Horizons, which will keep the spacecraft going through 2025. \"I am very excited about this second extended mission,\" Stern told Space.com. NASA and the New Horizons team are discussing budget numbers for fiscal year 2025, he added. Main action items Now on the New Horizons agenda are a trio of main action items, as approved by NASA. One involves looking for another flyby target \"and also more KBOs that we can study, not up close, but in the distance,\" Stern said. In addition, New Horizons is still transmitting the last bytes of data gathered during the Arrokoth flyby in 2019. \"We got delayed in that, mostly because the Deep Space Network had some upgrades. They took antennas down, and one was down for a year,\" Stern said. \"We've got roughly 90% of the Arrokoth flyby data on the ground, but we want everything, and that takes time. So that's a significant activity.\" Then there's the centerpiece of New Horizons' second extended mission - a diversity of observations across a variety of fields. \"While we are flying across the Kuiper Belt ,\" added Stern, \"we are going to be doing a very interdisciplinary mission in all the space sciences - astrophysics, planetary science and heliophysics. We're going to use this spacecraft to do things that really cannot be done except if you have a spacecraft out there. There's really never been anything like this. We're doing all three different space sciences by making New Horizons an observatory for all three purposes.\" For example, in heliophysics, the spacecraft will study \"pickup ions.\" These charged particles dominate the pressure of the outer heliosphere - the huge bubble of magnetic fields and particles that the sun blows around itself - and control where the boundary with the interstellar medium is situated. In astrophysics, New Horizons will study the cosmic optical and ultraviolet background, getting a nice view beyond the obscuring dust and other scattered light sources of the solar system's inner regions. New Horizons has already produced the most sensitive measurements of these backgrounds to date, with \"deep implications for cosmology,\" Stern noted. In the planetary science column, the probe is slated to study Uranus and Neptune from unique \"high phase angle\" geometries, shedding light on the important energy balances of those planets. \"There's never been anything really deeply interdisciplinary like New Horizons is going to become for this next three years in extended mission,\" said Stern. The New Horizons team also plans to obtain time on ground-based telescopes such as Keck and Subaru to find new KBOs to study as the probe zips by them, \"or if you get lucky and pass one that's close enough we could get to, we'll have a close flyby,\" Stern said. The New Horizons team is employing machine learning to hunt for new KBOs using such scopes. \"It turns out it is faster, more accurate, more reliable,\" said Stern. Weighed against human sleuthing, machine learning \"is better and finds more KBOs. So that's a breakthrough and saves us a lot of work and turns out a better product.\" Ground-based observations have shown that there are different classes of KBOs that have different colors and compositions. \"So we know there's a lot of heterogeneity among the KBOs,\" Stern said. \"If we had a flyby of a second KBO, I would not expect the same thing at all. It would be a completely different place than Arrokoth.\" KBOs teach scientists about planetesimals, the building blocks of planets thought to exist in protoplanetary disks and debris disks. The Arrokoth KBO flyby yielded a breakthrough result, Stern said: That at least some planetesimals formed very gently, in a process called a local cloud-collapse phenomenon. The New Horizons team would love to study another KBO up close, to see if its formation and evolution match what was observed at Arrokoth. \"We're turning this into a machine that does good for astrophysics and heliophysics while it's doing good for planetary science,\" Stern said about New Horizons and its second extended mission. \"They are equal partners in science, and that is a first for a planetary science mission.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/beyond-pluto-nasa-new-horizons-next-steps"}, {"title": "Where Is NASA's New Horizons Mission Now & What's Next", "date": "2022-08-03", "content": "NASA's New Horizons probe is currently deep inside the Kuiper Belt, but what's next for the little spacecraft that's exploring the depths of the solar system? New Horizons took a picture of Pluto's Heart, an icy region officially known as Tombaugh Regio, back in 2015. The image quickly became viral as it was the first time Pluto was seen up close, and the heart shape was endearing to fans of the former ninth planet. However, New Horizons has the potential to make more discoveries in its journey beyond Pluto and into the outskirts of the heliosphere. NASA has launched several probes over the years that have traveled great distances and provided scientists with valuable data about elusive gas giants like Uranus and Neptune. Some of the information and images obtained have made breakthrough discoveries that have allowed for a better understanding of how the solar system was formed and helped to make more accurate predictions about other regions of space. Using Jupiter's gravity assist, New Horizons made a flyby of Pluto and studied its terrain and atmosphere, finding a frozen world of perplexing icy structures beyond imagination. The small but mighty probe is well-equipped with seven instruments that can detect different kinds of light, solar wind, plasma, energetic particles, dust, etc. After its encounter with Pluto, New Horizons flew by the Kuiper Belt Object Arrokoth in 2019, also known as the most distant object ever explored up close by a spacecraft. These objects are highly sought after because they teach scientists about planetesimals, which are the building blocks of planets. Because of its prime location on the edge of the solar system, NASA has decided to extend the New Horizon mission by another two years. The intention is to perform multidisciplinary studies contributing to astrophysics, planetary science, and heliophysics. Alan Stern, New Horizon's main investigator, told Space, \" We're going to use this spacecraft to do things that really cannot be done except if you have a spacecraft out there.\" Closer Observations Of Uranus And Neptune According to NASA, New Horizons will make distant observations of Uranus and Neptune from unique geometries not possible from Earth. This would allow astronomers to compare them with distant exoplanets. It will continue to explore the solar system out to 63 astronomical units from Earth, using its instruments to understand the motions of charged particles as they interact with the solar wind and get a better picture of the large-scale structure of the heliosphere. New Horizons will also use machine learning in coordination with ground telescopes to find new KBOs, and use its cameras to map the faint cosmic background in visible and UV light. The achievements by New Horizons and other NASA probes put the U.S. ahead in the reconnaissance of the solar system. Rather than building and designing a mission from scratch, multidisciplinary studies of this kind become much cheaper if the spacecraft performing them continues to work over the years. For now, NASA gets to take advantage of New Horizon's good health and take her farther than ever in her scientific space quest.
