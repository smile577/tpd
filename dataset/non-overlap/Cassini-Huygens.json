The flyby gave Cassini a 5.5-kilometer-per-second (about 12,000-mile-per-hour) boost in speed, sending the spacecraft on toward the ringed planet more than 1 billion kilometers (almost one billion miles) away. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory confirmed that the spacecraft flew past Earth at an altitude of about 1,171 kilometers (727 miles), passing most closely above the eastern South Pacific at -23.5 degrees latitude and 231.5 degrees longitude. Cassini may have been visible from small islands in that area, such as Pitcairn Island or Easter Island. The spacecraft remains in excellent health as it continues along its seven-year-long journey to Saturn. Having completed its cruise among the inner planets, Cassini's future now resides in the cold, dark realm of the outer planets. The spacecraft will pass by Jupiter on December 30, 2000; the giant planet's gravity will bend Cassini's flight path to put it on course for arrival into orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004. Cassini's mission is to study Saturn, its moons, elaborate rings, and its magnetic and radiation environment for four years. Cassini will also deliver the European Space Agency's Huygens probe to parachute to the surface of Saturn's moon Titan. Titan is of special interest partly because of its many Earthlike characteristics, including a mostly nitrogen atmosphere and the presence of organic molecules in the atmosphere and on its surface. Lakes or seas of ethane and methane may exist on its surface. The Cassini/Huygens program is a joint endeavor of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Cassini orbiter, built by NASA, and the Huygens probe, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), were mated together and launched as a single package from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on October 15, 1997. Cassini's dish-shaped high-gain antenna was provided for the mission by the Italian Space Agency. At Saturn, the Huygens probe will detach from Cassini to parachute to the surface of Titan on November 30, 2004. Nine of Cassini's 12 science instruments were turned on to make observations of the Earth/Moon system. Scientific and engineering data from the Earth flyby will be transmitted by Cassini to receiving stations of NASA's Deep Space Network over coming days.

For the multinational Cassini-Huygens mission, NASA provided the large Cassini spacecraft, which will begin orbiting Saturn July 1, 2004, and the European Space Agency provided the Huygens probe, which will parachute into the atmosphere of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, on Jan. 14, 2005. Last week's Huygens checkout was the 10th since launch on Oct. 15, 1997. The probe is sleeping for most of the seven-year journey. About every six months, though, engineers wake it up to check its health and exercise the moving parts in its valves and pumps. \"As nearly as possible, we put the probe through all the stages of the real descent sequence,\" Standley said. The sequence lasts about five hours. Since Huygens remains inside a protective shell, the simulation can't include every instrument activity nor, of course, one-time events such as parachute deployment. The checkout does turn on each instrument for the periods they will be used as the probe descends, take data from each, and send the data to Cassini for transmission to Earth. That allows evaluation of the subsystems, such as power, computers and transmitter, as well as each instrument. Results of the checkout have been evaluated by engineers and scientists at the Huygens Probe Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, and at the home institutions for each of the probe's instruments in France, United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States. The Huygens atmospheric structure instrument will analyze features such as temperature, pressure and lightning at different layers of Titan's atmosphere. Instruments named the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and the aerosol collector and pyrolyser will work in tandem to collect, break down and identify particles and gases, including organic chemicals in the atmosphere. The descent imager/spectral radiometer will take pictures and spectra of the atmosphere and surface. The Doppler wind experiment will track how winds carry the probe.

The image is the first of many that should now begin to flow from the mission. \"Prepare to be amazed,\" said Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging team leader at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. In the new photograph, Saturn is 60 percent larger than it was in the last Cassini image, made in December. Details are visible in the planet's rings and clouds. And already scientists have found a puzzle. There is a \"noticeable absence\" of ghostly, spokelike dark markings in the rings. The features were discovered during the approach of the Voyager probe 23 years ago. Porco said this new puzzle is one of many in store for the mission. The origin of the rings is itself a mystery. Porco said images will now be released weekly, then more frequently starting in late May. The spacecraft will enter orbit around Saturn on July 1. The mission will explore the planet's atmosphere and its rings and moons. Scientists expect to find previously unknown moons embedded in the rings, which contain icy particles from dust-grain size up to rocks and boulders. On May 18, Cassini will enter the Saturn system, passing a group of outer moons as the gravitational pull of the giant planet begins to overpower that of the sun. Observations of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, will begin a few days later. On June 11, Cassini will photograph the moon Phoebe during a flyby. Phoebe is 137 miles (220 kilometers) wide, the largest of Saturn's outer moons and probably a captured asteroid. Cassini launched in 1997. To save fuel and money, it made several planetary flybys to get speed boosts by stealing a little orbital energy from the planets. It looped around Venus twice, then flew past Earth. Later it studied and photographed Jupiter while getting a final push toward Saturn. The spacecraft will release its piggybacked Huygens probe about six months after arriving at Saturn. Huygens will descend through the thick atmosphere of Titan on Jan. 14, 2005. Can you spot the moon? The new image was taken Feb. 9 and released Friday. Cassini was 43.1 million miles (69.4 million kilometers) from Saturn. The image contrast and colors have been slightly enhanced to improve visibility. The icy moon Enceladus is faintly visible to the left, outside the rings. Enceladus is about 323 miles (520 kilometers) wide. Its brightness has been increased seven times relative to the planet, in order to make it noticeable. Cassini will investigate the moon more closely later in the mission. Cassini has traveled 2.1 billion miles (3.4 billion kilometers) on its looping path. The mission is a cooperative effort of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.

This is the last single \"eyeful\" of Saturn and its rings achievable with the narrow angle camera on approach to the planet. From now until orbit insertion, Saturn and its rings will be larger than the field of view of the narrow angle camera. Color variations between atmospheric bands and features in the southern hemisphere of Saturn, as well as subtle color differences across the planet's middle B ring, are now more distinct than ever. Color variations generally imply different compositions. The nature and causes of any compositional differences in both the atmosphere and the rings are major questions to be investigated by Cassini scientists as the mission progresses. The bright blue sliver of light in the northern hemisphere is sunlight passing through the Cassini Division in Saturn's rings and being scattered by the cloud-free upper atmosphere. Two faint dark spots are visible in the southern hemisphere. These spots are close to the latitude where Cassini saw two storms merging in mid-March. The fate of the storms visible here is unclear. They are getting close and will eventually merge or squeeze past each other. Further analysis of such dynamic systems in Saturn's atmosphere will help scientists understand their origins and complex interactions. Moons visible in this image are (clockwise from top right): Enceladus (499 kilometers or 310 miles across), Mimas (398 kilometers or 247 miles across), Tethys (1060 kilometers or 659 miles across) and Epimetheus (116 kilometers or 72 miles across). Epimetheus is dim and appears just above the left edge of the rings. Brightnesses have been exaggerated to aid visibility.

The computer-initiated rocket firing, known as trajectory correction maneuver 20, began on time at 7:47:31 p.m. EDT and lasted some five minutes and 56 seconds. Assessment of Cassini's slightly altered trajectory, along with analysis of spacecraft telemetry, will not be available until later. But a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said \"everything appeared to have gone well,\" based on subtle changes in the radio signal coming from the spacecraft. TCM-20 was designed to change Cassini's velocity by about 78 mph, setting up a flyby of the moon Phoebe June 11. It also marked one of the final corrections before a 96-minute-long July 1 rocket firing required to put the spacecraft in orbit around Saturn. TCM-20 was relatively minor as such things go, but it marked the first time the craft's propulsion system was fully exercised since a major 87-minute \"deep space maneuver\" in December 1998. No one at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., expected any problems and a six-minute burn by the 100-pound-thrust main engine is \"pretty small by SOI or DSM standards,\" Cassini propulsion engineer Todd Barber, a veteran of the Galileo and Mars Exploration Rover missions, said last week. \"That's the bad news. The good news is it's totally regulated, so we'll be able to verify that all the valves work and that the helium's flowing properly.\" Helium provides the pressure needed to push propellant and oxidizer into the engine's combustion chamber. Cassini's main helium regulator began leaking shortly after launch in 1997, but by using a downstream valve to isolate the system between firings, engineers are able to manage the leakage. Those same procedures were used for TCM-20 and will be used again for Saturn orbit insertion and a final major orbit adjustment burn in late August. Unlike the lengthy, make-or-break SOI burn, TCM-20 could have been carried out in \"blow-down\" mode using residual tank pressure, Barber said, which would not have required use of the helium regulator. \"But it's ostensibly there not only to target Phoebe for our June 11 flyby, the major purpose of this burn is a propulsion system checkout,\" he said. \"It gives us a real warm fuzzy going into SOI.\" It currently takes radio signals from Earth, traveling through space at 186,000 miles per second, more than one hour and 20 minutes to reach Cassini. As a result, tonight's rocket firing, like all such burns, was initiated, controlled and shut down by the spacecraft's on-board computer. The burn \"is a good practice run, no question about that,\" said Cassini project manager Bob Mitchell. \"But the science from this is kind of a big deal, too.\" Discovered in 1898, Phoebe measures just 137 miles across, orbits Saturn at a distance of nine million miles and circles the planet in the opposite direction from its other moons. Because of that, and the tilt of its orbit, scientists believe Phoebe may be a captured asteroid or a Kuiper belt object left over from the birth of the solar system. Voyager 2 imaged Phoebe in 1981 from a distance of about 1.4 million miles. Tonight's rocket firing will allow Cassini to pass within just 1,250 miles of the enigmatic moon. \"Voyager imaged Phoebe a long time ago and got some images that were quite distant, quite blurred and didn't really provide a whole lot of information,\" Mitchell said. \"And now, we're going to get down to, I think, something like 18-meters-per-pixel resolution. And Phoebe has enough gravity that while it really doesn't do anything of any significance to the trajectory, it does tweak it enough that you can feel it. \"So the radio science guys ... will get a mass estimate from the flyby. From that and images that tell you the size, they get the density. So there's quite a bit of science coming back from this.\" Cassini was launched Oct. 15, 1997, from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Using two gravity assist flybys of Venus, one of Earth and a final boost from Jupiter, Cassini has taken seven years to reach its target. Carrying 12 sophisticated instruments and a European probe with a half-dozen instruments of its own that will descend through the atmosphere of the moon Titan, the $3.4 billion Cassini is the most complex deep space mission ever attempted. The 96.4-minute Saturn orbit insertion rocket firing, which will change Cassini's velocity by slightly more than 1,400 mph, is scheduled to begin at 10:35:42 p.m. EDT on June 30. It should end around 12:11 a.m. July 1, kicking off a planned four-year orbital tour of the ringed planet and its many moons.

Carolyn Porco, leader of the Cassini camera team, a serious Beatles fan and one of the world's leading authorities on Saturn's ring system, was almost at a loss for words describing her initial impressions of the new vistas opened up by Cassini. \"I don't think you have to be a ring scientist to imagine what last night was like to us,\" she said of the spacecraft's arrival in Saturn orbit and the initial batch of ring pictures beamed back to Earth early today. \"It was beyond description, it was mind blowing, it was every adjective you could think of. \"Even though we've had a long time to think about our images ... I'm surprised at how surprised I am at the beauty and the clarity of these images. They are shocking to me. You are going to see some images now, they were so shocking I thought my team here was playing tricks on me and showing me a simulation of the rings and not the rings themselves. It's just utterly remarkable.\" Cassini snapped 61 black-and-white pictures of Saturn's rings early today after completing a 96-minute rocket firing to brake into orbit around the ringed planet. Program manager Bob Mitchell reported this afternoon that engineering data radioed back from Cassini shows the spacecraft survived two ring plane crossings without incident and that all of its myriad subsystems were in good health and operating normally. Cassini skimmed over the top of the rings as it braked into orbit and shortly after main engine shut down, the spacecraft began carrying out commands to photograph the rings, first from the upper backlit side and then from below, where the thin disk of icy particles was bathed in direct sunlight. Because of Cassini's enormous velocity - 60,000 mph or so at engine cutoff - its cameras were programmed with shutter speeds of five thousandths of a second to prevent blurring. In the minute required to snap a picture, record the data and be ready for another shot, Cassini moved hundreds of miles, preventing researchers from taking overlapping photos or the multiple images required for color. But no one was complaining. \"The Cassini cameras are far more capable than the Voyager cameras were, which is in large part why these images are so spectacular,\" Porco said. \"The other part, of course, is that the spacecraft gives us a very steady platform. This machine, you turn it, you point it and it stays there. It's like a tripod in space. So it allows us to take very sharp images.\" Cassini will never again fly so close to the rings and the level of detail the craft's cameras captured was stunning. If there was a central theme to the pictures it was the ubiquitous presence of density waves, regions of alternating brightness and darkness that look like ripples in fine sand. The spacing of the ripples, caused by gravitational interactions with nearby moons, decreases as one moves outward from the planet. \"This is a telltale sign of a density wave, the wavelengths decreases as you go outward and also the amplitude of the wave damps so you see it disappear,\" Porco said, describing one picture. \"These are characteristics ring scientists read like a book to discern what kind of properties the particles have, how densely they're packed and so on. As I said, this is unprecedented resolution for the imaging experiment.\" One image showed a density wave thinning out to the right and a so-called bending wave moving to the left across the field of view. In a bending wave, \"it's not the number density of particles that is varying, it is literally the height of the ring plane,\" Porco said. \"You can think of the feature on the right as being like corrugated cardboard where the ring is literally warped and its warped because the moons which are exciting that particular wave excite inclination (tilt) in the particle orbits and the particle orbits get phased in such a way that it forms this pattern, which in fact is a spiral pattern. \"If you followed it around the rings, it would take the spiral form,\" she said. \"These are similar to the spiral arms of spiral galaxies.\" Describing a blow up of a density wave image, Porco pointed out strange looking structures that \"almost looks like straw. I don't know what this is. We think it's real, we see it in other images. ... So it's not some noise pattern in the image. \"There may be processes going on that make the particles clump on scales that you're seeing here. ... Nonetheless we're seeing something here and I literally don't have a clue. This may be brand new, something no one's ever predicted before.\" The picture Porco initially thought was a joke was focused on a gap in the outer A ring known as the Encke division, a narrow void swept out by the tiny moon Pan. Along with showing ultra clear views of spiralling density waves on both sides of the gap, the ring material forming the inner edge had a sharply scalloped appearance. Even to the layman, the picture appeared unusual. \"It just doesn't look real,\" Porco marveled. \"It's so sharp, the wakes that you see in the interior to the Encke gap, you can see the classic scalloped edges. These are caused by gravitational impulses by Pan - there may be other moons there, we don't know - which force eccentricities in the orbits of the particles on the edge of the gap. With repeated passages of the moon ... it builds up this sinusoidal pattern, this beautiful classic pattern. \"This is like textbook physics, textbook ring physics right there in one image,\" she said. At a news conference Porco was asked why the study of Saturn's rings was important. \"This is standard ring lore, that Saturn's rings especially are our closest analogue of the celestial disk system,\" she began. \"Frank Shu, an astrophysicist, said this many years ago: there are two types of bodies in the universe. There are spheres and there are disks. And under certain circumstances, a sphere can collapse down into a disk and that's what will happen if you have a spherical cloud of debris and the particles are colliding, they lose energy but they preserve angular momentum and they all end up in a plane. That's a very common process and its given rise to lots of disk system. \"One is Saturn's rings, one was the solar nebula out of which our solar system and the planets formed. Astronomers now see lots of disks around other stars and even reaching way far out in size to the spiral galaxies, they are another disk system. Common physics applies to all of them. \"So in studying rings, we hope to study processes that go on in disks in general,\" Porco said. \"And so we think we're seeing in Saturn's rings some of the processes that went on in the solar nebula before the planets formed. In fact, we may be seeing some of the processes that actually aided the development of the planets.\" If one is interested in \"understanding where the solar system came from or how it got here, how the planets were formed, then this is the place to go.\" Ed Weiler, an astronomer by training who serves as NASA's associate administrator for space flight, offered another reason to study Saturn and its rings. \"When I was growing up, this kind of stuff was science fiction,\" he said. \"We compete with a lot of things: Game Boys, X-Boxes and Play Stations. This isn't science fiction, we actually did this. We're in orbit around another planet taking these kinds of pictures with an incredible machine. We did this. This isn't animation, this isn't PowerPoint, this is real. I like data, and this is real data. \"So I hope we can excite at least a few more kids in this country to become scientists and engineers. If we can do that, it was worth every penny we spent on it.\" ", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/cassini/040701science.html"}, {"title": "Cassini finds puzzles in Saturn's ring ingredients", "date": "2004-07-02", "content": "Just two days after the Cassini spacecraft entered Saturn orbit, preliminary science results are already beginning to show a complex and fascinating planetary system. One early result intriguing scientists concerns Saturn's Cassini Division, the large gap between the A and B rings. While Saturn's rings are almost exclusively composed of water ice, new findings show the Cassini Division contains relatively more \"dirt\" than ice. Further, the particles between the rings seem remarkably similar to the dark material that scientists saw on Saturn's moon, Phoebe. These dark particles refuel the theory that the rings might be the remnants of a moon. The F ring was also found to contain more dirt. Another instrument on Cassini has detected large quantities of oxygen at the edge of the rings. Scientists are still trying to understand these results, but they think the oxygen may be left over from a collision that occurred as recently as January of this year. \"In just two days, our ideas about the rings have been expanded tremendously,\" said Dr. Linda Spilker, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., deputy project scientist for the Cassini-Huygens mission. \"The Phoebe-like material is a big surprise. What puzzles us is that the A and B rings are so clean and the Cassini Division between them appears so dirty.\" The visual and infrared mapping spectrometer onboard Cassini revealed the dirt mixed with the ice in the Cassini Division and in other small gaps in the rings, as well as in the F ring. \"The surprising fingerprint in the data is that the dirt appears similar to what we saw at Phoebe. In the next several months we will be looking for the origin of this material,\" said Dr. Roger Clark, of the U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, Colo., and a member of the Cassini science team. Cassini's ultraviolet imaging instrument detected the sudden and surprising increase in the amount of atomic oxygen at the edge of the rings. The finding leads scientists to hypothesize that something may have collided with the main rings, producing the excess oxygen. Dr. Donald Shemansky of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, co-investigator for Cassini's ultraviolet imaging spectrograph instrument, said, \"What is surprising is the evidence of a strong, sudden event during the observation period causing substantial variation in the oxygen distribution and abundance.\" Although atomic oxygen has not been previously observed, its presence is not a surprise because hydroxyl was discovered earlier from Hubble Space Telescope observations, and these chemicals are both products of water chemistry. Cassini's examination of Saturn's atmosphere began while the spacecraft was still approaching the planet. Winds on Saturn near the equator decrease dramatically with altitude above the cloud tops. The winds fall off by as much 140 meters per second (approximately 300 miles per hour) over an altitude range of 300 kilometers (approximately 200 miles) in the upper stratosphere. This is the first time winds have been measured at altitudes so high in Saturn's atmosphere. \"We are finally defining the wind field in three dimensions, and it is very complex,\" said Dr. Michael Flasar of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., principal investigator for Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer. \"Temperature maps obtained now that Cassini is orbiting Saturn are expected to show more detail, helping us to unravel the riddles of Saturn's winds above the cloud tops.\" Early Friday (Pacific Time), Cassini imaged Saturn's largest moon Titan, one of the prime targets for the mission. Titan is thought to harbor simple organic compounds that may be important in understanding the chemical building blocks that led to life on Earth. Although too cold to support life now, Titan serves as a frozen vault to see what early Earth might have been like. Scientists will receive the new data and images from Titan later Friday.

It will afford the scientists the opportunity to snap sharp images of Titan's surface, seek undiscovered chemicals in its dense atmosphere and to map the site where, in January, a tiny European space probe named Huygens will parachute from Cassini onto the moon's surface and hopefully radio back whatever mysteries it finds there. \"Cassini will see Titan as it has never been seen before,\" said Charles Elachi, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and team leader for the spacecraft's radar team. \"We expect our onboard instruments will pierce the moon's dense atmosphere and reveal a whole new world.\" \"We're in for quite a show,\" said Carolyn Porco of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo., who heads Cassini's international imaging operations team. Although the flyby of Titan takes place this morning, Cassini's antenna will be pointing away from Earth at the time, so the first images will not reach receivers here for processing until at least nine hours later, mission controllers said. According to Robert H. Brown of the University of Arizona, Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer should gather the very first high- resolution images of Titan's unknown geology. \"We don't really know what we'll encounter there,\" he said. \"I suppose you can assume we'll see common geologic forms like mountains and craters and tectonic forms -- and maybe even volcanism.\" And although Earthbound telescopes have already identified at least 19 individual chemicals in Titan's atmosphere, the scientists probing the smoglike clouds believe they will find many more -- perhaps an atmosphere similar in composition to that of the early Earth. Most intriguing of all is that Titan's atmosphere may be raining methane and that its surface may be dotted with thousands of frigid lakes of liquid ethane, said Roger Yelle, a University of Arizona planetary scientist. Both methane and ethane are hydrocarbons that could hold revealing clues to the very first steps in nature's process of assembling organic molecules that are the precursors to amino acids, Yelle said, which in turn are the building blocks of life. During its four-year mission around Saturn, Cassini scientists have planned 44 more flybys past Titan, some of which will be even closer to the mysterious moon. None, however, is likely to provide as much information as the Huygens probe does in January -- if it actually reaches the surface, and if its radio actually works once it gets there.

The image has been magnified 10 times and has been enhanced in contrast to bring out details. The mottled pattern is an artifact of the processing. The larger scale brightness variations are real. No further processing to remove the effects of the overlying atmosphere has been performed. The superimposed coordinate system grid in the accompanying image on the right illustrates the geographical regions of the moon that are illuminated and visible, as well as the orientation of Titan -- north is up and rotated 25 degrees to the left. The yellow curve marks the position of the boundary between day and night on Titan. This image shows about one quarter of Titan's surface, from 180 to 250 degrees west longitude, and overlaps part of the surface shown in the previous Cassini image release. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.

One-way light time from Saturn to Earth currently is about 68 minutes. In a long-awaited milestone, a European-built probe carrying cameras and a suite of scientific instruments was released from NASA's Cassini Saturn orbiter Christmas Eve, setting up a dramatic Jan. 14 plunge into the atmosphere of the ringed planet's mysterious moon Titan. Ejected by springs designed to impart a 7-rpm rotation for stability, the Huygens probe was jettisoned from the Cassini mothership around 10:08 p.m. EST. Flight controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., verified a clean separation 16 minutes later. \"The short story is the release went absolutely nominally,\" said Earl Maize, Cassini deputy program manager. \"As near as we can tell from all the telemetry we've seen, we've had a perfect separation. The release sequence was executed on board the spacecraft at 7:07 this evening Pacific Standard Time. We were out of radio contact at the time, we expected the release to impart a recoil to the spacecraft and it would take it some minutes to recover radio contact with the Earth. We got back into contact at 7:24 and telemetry soon thereafter verified that all of the events went just as we expected.\" Data from Cassini showed the main umbilical between the mothership and Huygens was severed as expected, pyrotechnic devices fired as planned and the orbiter recoiled as engineers predicted it would. \"So we have every expectation that the release was perfectly nominal,\" Maize told reporters in an early Christmas Day teleconference. \"The radio contact was right on the spot and detailed analysis is in progress.\" Said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, European Space Agency Huygens project scientist: \"I feel very happy. We are now on our way to Titan. It will take 20 days and a big day is in front of us on the 14th of January.\" Cassini will attempt to photograph the departing Huygens probe later today to more precisely determine its trajectory. \"We wish to congratulate our European partners as their journey begins and wish them well on their descent to Titan,\" Robert Mitchell, Cassini program manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said earlier in a statement. \"We are very excited to see the probe off and to have accomplished this part of our job. Now we're ready to finish our part - receiving and relaying the Huygens data back to Earth.\" If all goes well, the flying saucer-shaped Huygens will slam into Titan's hydrocarbon-rich atmosphere around 5:13 a.m. Jan. 14 at a velocity of some 12,400 mph. Descending through the moon's smoggy atmosphere under parachutes, Huygens will finally reach the surface some two-and-a-half hours after atmospheric entry. Throughout the descent, data from Huygens' instruments will be transmitted to Cassini, flying past the moon nearly 40,000 miles away, stored on digital recorders and later re-transmitted to Earth. Huygens represents one of the most ambitious space projects ever attempted by the European Space Agency and one that if successful, will reveal a new world to the gaze of eager scientists. \"Today's release is another successful milestone in the Cassini-Huygens odyssey,\" David Southwood, science director for the European Space Agency, said in a statement. \"This was an amicable separation after seven years of living together. Our thanks to our partners at NASA for the lift. Each spacecraft will now continue on its own but we expect they'll keep in touch to complete this amazing mission. Now all our hopes and expectations are focused on getting the first in-situ data from a new world we've been dreaming of exploring for decades.\" The stage was set for the probe's release Dec. 16 when flight controllers at JPL carried out orbital trim maneuver No. 8, an 84.9-second main engine firing that put Cassini - and Huygens - on a collision course with Titan. With Huygens now safely on its way, Cassini's engine will be fired again Dec. 27 to move the mother ship off the current impact trajectory and set up the proper geometry to relay data during the entry probe's descent. A timeline of critical upcoming events is available here. To reach Titan's surface, Huygens first must survive its high-speed plunge into the moon's atmosphere. After slowing to about 870 mph due to atmospheric friction, Huygens' aft cover will be pulled away by a pilot chute and the spacecraft's 27-foot-wide main parachute will deploy. The chute will be jettisoned 15 minutes after entry begins and from that point on, Huygens will ride beneath a smaller 9.8-foot-wide parachute. Impact on the surface at some 11 mph is expected around 7:31 a.m. on Jan. 14 Assuming the 705-pound Huygens doesn't splash down in a hydrocarbon lake, \"we have good confidence the probe will survive landing,\" said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, European Space Agency project scientist. \"The landing speed is very low and there is a very good probability the probe will survive landing and we have capability to do measurements for half an hour on the surface. During the three-hour measurement phase, the probe will transmit its data to the overflying orbiter.\" The original flight plan called for Huygens to enter Titan's atmosphere in late November as Cassini streaked overhead at an altitude of just 746 miles. But engineers were forced to delay Huygens' arrival to January because of an issue with the radio aboard the Cassini mothership that will be used to relay data from Huygens to Earth. During a post-launch test, engineers discovered the radio receiver could not cope with the Doppler shift in the frequency of the signal coming from Huygens due to Cassini's high relative velocity. Much like the pitch of a siren changes as a police car races past a stationary observer, the frequency of radio waves can shift a significant amount if relative velocities are high enough. \"Originally, the closing speed of Cassini coming up on Huygens, which is for all practical purposes sitting still once it's in the atmosphere, the closing speed was about 5.8 kilometers per second ,\" Mitchell said in a recent interview. \"We were coming in almost dead overhead and going off to the right at about 1,200 kilometers altitude.\" The solution was to minimize the Doppler shift by reducing the relative velocities of the two spacecraft. That was accomplished by changing Cassini's trajectory slightly and delaying Huygens' release to Christmas Eve. During the Jan. 14 descent, Cassini now will be 37,300 miles from Titan and the difference in velocity between the two spacecraft will never be more than 8,500 mph. \"We have pretty solid evidence that's going to work,\" Mitchell said. \"We did some tests where we used the Deep Space Network stations transmitting an S-band signal with telemetry modulated onto the carrier so that from the receiver's point of view on the Cassini spacecraft, it should have simulated the probe quite accurately. We adjusted the frequency, taking into account the motion of everything, so that the frequency of the received signal at the receiver should very closely if not exactly match the frequency that the receiver will see coming from Huygens.\" The tests were successful and a potentially crippling design flaw was resolved with no significant loss of science. And the scientific community can't wait to get that data. Bigger than the planet Mercury, Titan is the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere, one in which hydrocarbons are believed to fall as rain, possibly forming liquid ethane pools on the moon's ultra-cold surface. Cassini flew past Titan in late October, beaming back pictures and radar data that revealed a strange, striated landscape with sharply defined bright and dark regions. Few clouds were present and no large craters were apparent, indicating tectonic, volcanic or depositional processes at work that have resurfaced the moon on a global scale. But there was no clear evidence of lakes or pools of liquid ethane or similar materials that many scientists believe must be present given the moon's ultra- low temperature, high atmospheric pressure and hydrocarbon chemistry. In short, Titan's mysteries withstood Cassini's initial scientific assault. \"We've been saying for a long time now that Titan was the largest expanse of unexplored terrain in the solar system,\" said imaging team leader Carolyn Porco, a leading expert on Saturn's rings. \"And what remains hidden under the atmosphere and under the haze, the conditions at its surface, its geological history and so on are, at least in my mind, the solar system's last great mystery.\" ", "url": "https://www.spaceflightnow.com/cassini/041224huygens.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Go Huygens!", "date": "2005-01-11", "content": "This map illustrates the planned imaging coverage for the Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer, onboard the European Space Agency's Huygens probe during the probe's descent toward Titan's surface on Jan. 14, 2005. The Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer is one of two NASA instruments on the probe. The colored lines delineate regions that will be imaged at different resolutions as the probe descends. On each map, the site where Huygens is predicted to land is marked with a yellow dot. This area is in a boundary between dark and bright regions. This map was made from the images taken by the Cassini spacecraft cameras on Oct. 26, 2004, at image scales of 4 to 6 kilometers per pixel. The images were obtained using a narrow band filter centered at 938 nanometers - a near-infrared wavelength at which light can penetrate Titan's atmosphere to reach the surface and return through the atmosphere to be detected by the camera. The images have been processed to enhance surface details. Only brightness variations on Titan's surface are seen; the illumination is such that there is no shading due to topographic variations. For about two hours, the probe will fall by parachute from an altitude of 160 kilometers to Titan's surface. During the descent the camera on the probe and five other science instruments will send data about the moon's atmosphere and surface back to the Cassini spacecraft for relay to Earth.

Built by the European Space Agency, the 705-pound Huygens probe landed on Titan between 7:45-7:46 a.m. EST and delivered the scientific goods researchers were hoping for, beaming data home via NASA's Cassini orbiter. 6:05 p.m. EST: After seven years in transit and 25 years in development, ESA's Huygens probe has fulfilled its mission to set down on Saturn's moon Titan and send data home. \"The European Space Agency deserves a tremendous amount of credit,\" said Al Diaz, NASA's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, earlier today while appearing to hold back tears during the announcement that Huygens sent data home. \"There will only be one first successful landing on Titan, and this was it.\" While this concludes today's live commentary for the Huygens mission, in Darmstadt researchers and engineers continue to work through the night. A final wrap up of the Huygens mission is set to be broadcast on NASA TV beginning at 5 a.m. EST on Jan. 15, with a final news briefing scheduled for 12:00 p.m. EST the same day. Check for an updated final story to be posted on the SPACE.com homepage shortly. 5:41 p.m. EST: \"With a single picture, we can start unlocking the secrets that we could only ponder with an orbiter,\" said JPL researcher Torrance Johnson, a Cassini imaging team member who lauded his counterparts with the Huygens mission. \"Getting these pictures out as fast with Huygens' complex system is quite an achievement.\" 5:28 p.m. EST: Martin Tomasko, Huygens imaging instrument lead, said that initial studies of the probes Titan images have found that the darker regions once puzzled by astronomers appear to be smooth surfaces, while the brighter areas are elevated terrain. 5:00 p.m. EST: Huygens researchers are poring through hundreds of images and spectra data, and they will most likely work through the night studying the informational treasure sent home by the hardy probe, ESA commentators said. 3:00 p.m. EST: The first images of Titan have been pulled from Huygens data downlink to Earth. Martin Tomasko, lead scientist for Huygens' camera, said the probe has taken clear images after punching through the bottom of the moon's hazy cloud layer. Tomasko said researchers have currently pulled about 350 images of Titan's surface from the available data, revealing a wealth of textures and clear surface definition. 2:00 p.m. EST: Charles Elachi, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory - which sent Huygens' Titan data to ESA's ESOC spacecraft operation center - said today that researchers may have the first images of Titan ready in about two hours. 1:30 p.m. EST: The Huygens probe performed its mission with flying colors, sending a near-complete set back to its creators by way of the Cassini orbiter. During today's post-landing briefing, ESA officials said the hardy probe not only successfully sent data home, but continued to live long past its expected lifetime. \"We don't know if we are going to get to see the probe dying,\" Jean-Pierre Lebreton, Huygens mission manager for ESA, told reporters. Researchers are anticipating the first images of Titan - as seen by Huygens' onboard camera - to be available to the public some time in the next few hours. ESA mission commentary on the probe's descent and intial science data is expected to resume at 2:45 p.m. EST. 11:40 a.m. EST: Huygens worked \"beautifully\" according to ESA Director- General Jean-Jacque Dordain. \"The morning was good, the afternoon is better,\" Dordain said. \"We have a scientific success.\" 11:35 a.m. EST: It's confirmed! Huygens has successfully returned science data from Titan's surface. The probe's landing is the farthest touchdown for any human-built object to set land on another world. A news briefing on Huygens' apparent success is underway and its thumbs-up all around for mission scientists and managers. 11:19 a.m. EST: Shouts and applause erupted from Huygens mission control, and presumably some data from the probe has apparently arrived. \"We have it? We have it!\" said one mission team member before the shouts. Stand by for confirmation. 11:15 a.m. EST: ESA officials had said earlier today that they anticipated the first science from Huygens at this time. So far, no word on the status of science data from the Titan probe. 11:12 a.m. EST: There is some discussion, from talk broadcast from ESOC's main control room, that it may be another seven minutes for the first Huygens data. 11:00 a.m. EST: ESA and NASA Huygens team members are still waiting to see the first data sent by the probe from Saturn's hazy moon Titan. At ESA's ESOC spacecraft operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, personnel are steadily gathering around computer consoles in anticipation. 10:35 a.m. EST: It's confirmed. Cassini has turned back to the Earth and is sending data. No Huygens probe data has been downloaded yet, but researchers are waiting expectantly. \"We have 40 more minutes of suspense, then we'll know if everything worked properly,\" said John Dodsworth, Huygens ground manager at ESOC. 10:30 a.m. EST: Applause broke out briefly at ESA's ESOC spacecraft operations center in Darmstadt, Germany. Apparently, mission controllers have detected the first data from Cassini's Huygens receivers, spacecraft engineers said. That doesn't mean that any Huygens science has arrived, just that the receivers aboard Cassini designed to record that data were functioning at the start of the descent, they added. 10:15 a.m. EST: Huygens is still pounding out a signal to the surprise of ESA engineers, but any science data it is currently transmitting is falling on deaf ears. The Cassini orbiter, Huygens' only connection to Earth, has turned away from the probe and is preparing to relay the probe's data home, mission controllers said. \"The probe has been living for more than five hours,\" said Huygens mission manager Jean-Pierre Lebreton. \"But we knew at a certain time Cassini would have to stop recording.\" Lebreton said the Huygens science team is eager to see any science data, but can wait. After all, they've waited more than seven years -Cassini-Huygens launched in 1997 - just to reach this point in the mission, he added. 10:00 a.m. EST: Engineers at JPL said that although Huygens' data will first be received at JPL, it will be forwarded straight to ESA's ESOC spacecraft operations center in Germany where hundreds of scientists and engineers are eagerly awaiting news from the Titan probe. 9:50 a.m. EST: As ESA commentators take a break in Darmstadt, Germany, researchers and engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California are lauding Huygens' apparently successful landing on Titan. \"There are a lot of excited people in Darmstadt and here too,\" said ESA Huygens system engineer Shaun Standley at JPL. 9:45 a.m. EST: By 10 a.m. EST, mission managers expect Cassini to have begun to swing back to point toward Earth and deliver the first packets of information from the Huygens probe on Titan. 9:20 a.m. EST: NASA's Cassini orbiter has a quadruple redundant data recording capability, meaning the spacecraft is collecting Huygens data with four redundant systems in hopes of ensuring that no information is lost, ESA officials said. \"We really don't want to lose any bit of this precious data,\" ESA mission operations manager Claudio Solazzo said earlier today. 9:10 a.m. EST: \"The probe is still alive and sending a signal,\" said Claudio Solazzo, ESA Huygens mission operations manager. Now that Huygens is apparently on Titan, researchers hope a pair of electronic levels will register any movement of the probe. If it landed on a hydrocarbon lake, the levels would detect any bobbing motion, researchers have said. A penetrating instrument on Huygens' bottom should make a very simple measurement upon landing to determine if the landing zone is firm, clay, sand or other type of surface, Huygens mission scientists said. 8:35 a.m. EST: Huygens mission controllers report that the probe landed somewhere between 1:45 p.m. and 1:46 p.m. local time in Darmstadt, Germany, that's somewhere between 7:45 a.m. and 7:46 a.m. EST. The probe is apparently on Titan's surface and still going strong, mission managers said. 8:00 a.m. EST: The first Huygens news briefing post-Titan descent has concluded. ESA mission managers said Huygens' carrier signal, the only signal researchers expected to detect from Earth, has also been detected by the Parkes radio telescope in Australia. The signal has been blaring strong for two hours now, researchers said. Mission manager Jean-Pierre Lebreton said that four optical telescopes around the world were trained on Titan during Huygens' descent. One telescope was unable to observe the event due to poor weather, while the other three failed to detect any sign of a entry fireball, he added. The first real telemetry from Huygens should reach Earth around 10:21 a.m. EST, though it will be 4:21 p.m. local time at ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany. The first science data is anticipated to arrive by 11:15 a.m. EST, mission controllers said. 7:45 a.m. EST: At least one instrument aboard Huygens is taking data. A Doppler instrument designed to track wind patterns on Titan is apparently working, Jean-Pierre Lebreton, Huygens mission manager, said during the press conference. 7:20 a.m. EST: The first news briefing on today's Huygens descent to Titan should begin in about 10 minutes at ESA's ESOC spacecraft operations center. Huygens reached Titan successfully about two hours ago, and should have touching down on the moon's surface at 7:34 a.m. EST according to a NASA mission timeline. 6:45 a.m. EST: ESA officials say the mood at ESOC has eased with the Huygens signal detection by West Virginia's Green Bank Telescope. Nail-biting tension has been replaced with some relief, though Huygens mission scientists are still eager to learn if their science instruments are taking measurements as designed. \"We're now just waiting for Cassini,\" John Dodsworth said earlier. 6:15 a.m. EST: With the confirmation signal from Huygens in hand, ESA officials know the probe is currently floating down toward Titan under its main parachute. It will jettison the parachute as it descends and deploy a smaller, three-meter parachute in order to reach the surface before onboard batteries run out, mission managers said today. --After a nearly seven year journey, the spacecraft swung into an orbit around the giant gas globe tonight, ready to spend the next four years performing scientific investigations of the Saturnian system. 6:05 a.m. EST: Space News Staff Writer Peter de Selding reports live from Huygens mission control: DARMSTADT, Germany-- A network of powerful ground telescopes has picked up the signal of Europe's Huygens descent probe 1.2 billion kilometers away, confirming that the probe is alive as it begins its descent into the thick atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. European Space Agency officials at Huygens mission control here said the signal -- no more than the equivalent of a telephone dial tone -- was detected by a network of 18 telescopes deployed to listen for a signal coming directly from Huygens. The biggest of these antennas is the 100-meter-diameter Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia. The signal did not confirm anything beyond the fact that Huygens is alive. But it was enough to cause a burst of applause here when announced at 5:35 a.m. EST today. 'There is a lot of emotion in this room,\" said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, Huygens program manager at ESA. \"It's great news.\" Leonid Gurvitz, mission manager for Huygens' communications with the ground telescope network, said 18 telescopes including Green Bank had been trained to pick up a signal and that it is the network itself, more than any single telescope, that received the Huygens signal. NASA's Cassini satellite, which carried Huygens to Saturn orbit, has been moved into position to receive Huygens mission data during the probe's 2.5-hour descent into Huygens' thick atmosphere. A more-complete assessment of whether Huygens' parachutes have deployed and its heat shield jettisoned to permit the start of observations is expected to be received by science teams from Cassini around 11:20 a.m. EST today. 6:00 a.m. EST: If it switched on as planned, a microphone instrument aboard Huygens may allow researchers to recreate the sound of the probe's descent as it plunged through Titan's atmosphere, ESA mission scientists said. The instrument may also record thunder, and Huygens scientists hope to have at least initial data to present within 24 hours. 5:50 a.m. EST: Cautious ESA commentators stress the Huygens signal is just a carrier tone. There is no confirmation that the six science instruments aboard the probe are working as planned. \"It looks like we heard the baby crying,\" said Huygens mission manager Jean- Pierre Lebreton from the floor of ESOC mission control. \"But clearly it tells us the probe is alive, the entry has been successful and we are under parachutes.\" 5:35 a.m. EST: Huygens speaks from Titan! ESA has confirmed that the Green Bank Telescope successfully detected a Huygens signal tone. The signal, a confirmation that Huygen's transmitter is at least functioning, and activated on time at about 5:18 a.m. EST. About 600 people are at ESOC mission control for Huygens Titan descent and some engineers crowded around computer monitors when the signal confirmation was announced. \"It's a tremendously exciting moment,\" said John Dodsworth, Huygens ground manager at ESOC. 5:30 a.m. EST: If everything is going well, researchers may be able to assemble Huygens first pictures of Titan within 24 hours, U.S. astronomer Martin Tomakso, the international lead of the probe's only optical instrument, has said. \"The first images may be pretty murky,\" Tomasko said from Darmstadt, adding that Titan's nitrogen-rich atmosphere is quite hazy. \"But we think the haze has a bottom, and that once we get through it we'll have a clear view of the surface.\" Tomasko said that during its slow descent, Huygens will most likely be swinging and rocking while taking numerous images that will later have to be assembled into mosaics. The Sun should appear 10 times smaller from Titan than it does from Earth, so researchers expect a sort of twilight environment, he added. 5:15 a.m. EST: According to its timeline, Huygens should now be transmitting data to its Cassini mothership, after deploying a series of parachutes to slow its descent. The first few measurements could already be in Cassini's data file, researchers say. But they will not know for sure whether Huygens transmitter is working unless Green Bank is successful in picking up the tone, or from Cassini once it turns back toward Earth. 5:00 a.m. EST: ESA's Huygens probe is scheduled to reach Titan in the next few minutes. While all Huygens data will be recorded by Cassini for later playback to Earth, astronomers are hoping that the powerful 100 by 110-meter Green Bank radio telescope in West Virginia will pick up a simple tone from the probe. 4:15 a.m. EST: Al Diaz, NASA's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, is monitoring the joint Cassini-Huygens operations at ESA's ESOC mission control center in Darmstadt. \"It's a mission unlike anything we've tried before,\" he said today of Cassini- Huygens. 4:00 a.m. EST: ESA is providing a real time tracking of Cassini and Huygens. You can see find it here. At last report, Huygens was set to reach Titan at about 5:05 a.m. EST, then deploy parachutes a few minutes later. The Cassini orbiter was last reported about 72,000 kilometers from Titan. It has turned away from Earth to record any data Huygens is able to broadcast. 3:30 a.m. EST: ESA mission controllers are playing a waiting game now with Huygens' mothership Cassini. The NASA orbiter has apparently turned away from Earth and is oriented toward Titan to receive data fromthe Huygens probe. European commentators have their fingers crossed that Huygens' descent goes better than a recent - but fictional - probe to Titan in the BBC science fiction series Space Odyssey. In that series, which follows a crew of astronauts exploring the solar system, an automated Titan probe fails after deployement. 3:25 a.m. EST: Huygens mission controllers report the probe is hurtling toward Titan at about 22,000 kilometers an hour. 3:20 a.m. EST: John Dodsworth, of ESA's ESOC mission control center at Darmstadt, said Huygens is about two hours from reaching Titan interface - about 1,270 kilometers above the surface. The probe is right on target and will land well within its target, he added. 3 a.m. EST: ESA officials are counting down to the Huygens probe's arrival at Titan. The probe is still a few hours off from encountering the moon's atmosphere. \"I certainly am jumping all over in anticipation,\" said Claudio Solazzo, ESA Huygens Mission operations manager, from Darmstadt, Germany. \"Today is a great day.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/684-touchdown-titan-huygens-probe-hits-mark.html"}, {"title": "Probe lands on Saturn moon; sends photos", "date": "2005-01-15", "content": "A European space probe Friday sent back the first detailed pictures of the frozen surface of Saturn's moon Titan, showing stunning black and white images of what appeared to be hilly terrain riddled with channels or riverbeds carved by a liquid. One picture, taken about 10 miles above the surface as the Huygens spacecraft descended by parachute to a safe landing after a seven-year voyage from Earth, showed snaking, dark lines cut into the light-colored surface. \"Clearly there is liquid matter flowing on the surface of Titan,\" said scientist Marty Tomasko of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, in Tucson, which made the probe's camera. He said the liquid appeared to be flowing into a dark area at the right side of the image. \"It almost looks like a river delta,\" he said. \"It could be liquid methane, or hydrocarbons that settled out of the haze\" that envelops Titan. Another image, taken about five miles above the surface, showed light and dark masses, which Tomasko said seemed to be shadows, indicating a varied terrain. The dark areas appeared to be flooded or to have been so at an earlier time. A third image taken at the surface showed several large white chunks - boulders or blocks of water ice - in the foreground and a stretch of gray surface behind them. \"There aren't too many planets with liquid,\" Tomasko said. \"There's Earth, and now there's Titan.\" Titan is the first moon other than the Earth's to be explored. Scientists believe its atmosphere is similar to that of the young Earth, and studying it could provide clues to how life arose here. \"I think all of us continue to be amazed as we watch our solar system unveil,\" NASA science administrator Alphonso Diaz said as the extraordinary images were displayed on screens at mission control in Darmstadt. \"It challenges all our preconceptions that all these planets are static places. Seeing a planet emerge that has dynamics and complexity to it is just amazing.\" Huygens was spun off from the Cassini mother ship on Dec. 24 before its descent to the surface of Titan. The mission is a joint effort among NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian space agency. Scientists say they received more than three hours of data from Huygens' descent, and more than 10 minutes of data from the surface itself. \"I'm shocked. It's remarkable,\" said Carolyn Porco of the Cassini Imaging Center. \"There are river channels. There are channels cut by something ... a fluid of some sort is my best guess.\" \"This mission has been like a fantasy come true,\" she told CNN. \"It's a great moment not only for science but for humankind.\" Applause erupted at mission control in Darmstadt at news of the data transmission from the probe. \"The scientific data we are collecting now shall unveil the secrets of this new world,\" said Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's general director. \"This is a fantastic success for Europe.\" The heart of the mission was the probe's 2 1/2-hour parachute descent, taking pictures and sampling the atmosphere before landing on Titan, where temperatures are estimated at 292 degrees below zero. Early signals confirmed it had powered up for entry and deployed the parachute, and officials were confident it had made a safe landing because Huygens was designed to go on transmitting from the surface for at least three minutes before its batteries died - a total transmission of less than three hours. But the signal kept coming for more than five hours. Mission officials - who have waited since 1997 for Huygens to reach its destination - had tears in their eyes as the first signal was picked up, indicating the probe was transmitting to the Cassini mother ship. Named after Titan's discoverer, the 17th century Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, the probe carries instruments to explore Titan's atmosphere and find out whether it has the cold seas of liquid methane and ethane that have been theorized by scientists. Timers inside the 705-pound probe awakened it just before it entered Titan's atmosphere. Huygens is shaped like a wok and covered with a heat shield to survive the intense heat of entry. The probe was designed to shed its heat shield during descent and use a special camera and instruments to collect information on wind speeds and the makeup of Titan's atmosphere for transmission back to Cassini and relay to NASA's Deep Space Network in California and to ESA controllers in Darmstadt. Titan is the only moon in the solar system known to have a significant atmosphere. Rich in nitrogen and containing about 6 percent methane, its atmosphere is believed to be 1 1/2 times thicker than Earth's. Alphonso Diaz, science administrator for NASA, said Titan may offer hints about the conditions under which life first arose on Earth. \"Titan is a time machine,\" Diaz said. \"It will provide us the opportunity to look at conditions that may well have existed on Earth in the beginning. It may have preserved in a deep freeze many chemical compounds that set the stage for life on Earth.\" Part of a $3.3 billion international mission to study the Saturn system, Huygens is also equipped with instruments to study Titan's surface upon landing. The Cassini-Huygens mission was launched on Oct. 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral, Fla., to study Saturn, its spectacular rings and many moons.

The orange hue of Titan, he said, was recorded by spectrometers aboard the instrument, he said. Sounds generated from the microphone and radar sensors of the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument gave researchers a chance to hear the probe's its plunge through Titan's atmosphere. Droning winds can be heard in one sound clip recorded by Huygens' microphone during descent. In another, radar echoes rise in pitch and intensity as the Huygens gets closer to Titan's surface. \"It was impossible to transmit the entire soundtrack,\" said HASI principal investigator Marcello Fulchigoni, adding that the sounds he released today were reconstructed from snippets by researchers. \"But we have the principal fragments of these sounds.\" The communications glitch will mean that doppler wind data from Huygens will need to be pieced together from the many ground telescopes that were trained on Huygens during its two and one-half-hour descent to Titan's surface on Jan. 14. But that data will be available given the global response of radio astronomers to Huygens, said Leonid Gurvits, head of the team that coordinated the 18 primary telescopes in Australia, China, Japan, the United States and Europe. \"We will get the same scientific result, it will just take a little longer,\" Gurvits said. Tomasko added that 350 images during descent and continuing after Huygens' landing were received on the one working communications channel -- half the crop that would have been harvested had both lines been functioning. \"We do have holes sin our panoramic mosaics,\" Tomasko said after showing one striking panorama stitched together the night of Jan. 14-15 by science teams.

The latest images underline the belief that Huygens landed at the shoreline of what appears to be large body of liquid when it ended a seven-year journey, reaching Saturn's largest moon Friday. Scientists at the European Space Agency are scrambling to determine the exact spot where the probe came to rest on Titan's mysterious, frozen surface. One photo released Tuesday showed a large body of liquid - possibly liquid methane - jutting into what appeared to be rough, frozen terrain, with the probe appearing to be just meters from the shoreline. Another series of photos showed how Titan's hazy atmosphere gave way to a more solid, but clearly varied surface as the probe tumbled and spun toward its final resting place. \"There wasn't even a glitch at impact. That landing was a lot friendlier than we had anticipated,\" Charles See, a scientist who has been studying the images, said in a release from ESA. In addition to the soft landing, material that appears to have accumulated on the camera lens in the final images suggests the weight of the 320-kilogram probe may have pulled it into the muddy surface. About 30 scientists are working to recreate the probe's descent to Titan's surface in an effort to determine wind speeds and chemical makeup of Titan's atmosphere. Cassini carried Huygens into space and ejected it on Christmas Day. The orbiter also played a key role in picking up the probe's transmission and relaying the telemetry to NASA, which passed the data on to ESA. Scientists said Tuesday they were surprised the probe rocked so much during its descent, tilting at least 10 to 20 degrees during its descent during the high-altitude haze. \"The ride was bumpier than we though it would be,\" said Marty Tomasko of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who heads the imaging team. Huygens, named after Titan's discoverer, the 17th century Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, carried instruments to explore Titan's atmosphere. It will take years for scientists to fully process the information collected during the probe's 2 1/2-hour descent. Titan is the only moon in the solar system known to have a significant atmosphere.

Methane concentrations are replenished probably from an underground source, they said during a press briefing held here. A week's analysis of the 350 photos and other data received from the Huygens descent probe confirmed many of the suppositions made about Titan and whetted scientists' appetite for a follow-on mission. \"We can now dream seriously of sending rovers to Titan,\" said Huygens project manager Jean-Pierre Lebreton of the European Space Agency. \"All we need is the money.\" It took NASA's Cassini satellite seven years to reach Saturn orbit, and then release Huygens. With no Huygens revisits currently scheduled, it will be at least a decade before Huygens' data is complemented by another descent probe or lander. Meanwhile, the Cassini orbiter will be using Huygens data to help in measuring Titan from orbit. \"Huygens has provided ground truth for Cassini,\" Lebreton said. As captivated as they were by what Huygens discovered in a 3.5-hour descent and landing on Titan on Jan. 14, Huygens scientists cautioned against generalizing about what Huygens' surface looks like. \"We sent three spacecraft to Mars and they all went to the most boring places\" before other satellites discovered the most interesting features of Mars, said Toby Owen of the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu. Owen is a principle investigator for studying Huygens' atmospheric sensors. Huygens images, he said, \"come from one single place in a very different world.\" Huygens landed on a solid surface that post-mission analysis suggests resembles a sandy area covered by a thin crust, according to John C. Zarnecki, lead scientists for Huygens' Surface Science Package instruments. Martin G. Tomasko of the University of Arizona at Tucson, principal investigator for Huygens' camera system, said the 350 images taken by Huygens and relayed by Cassini to Earth suggest it had rained liquid methane recently before Huygens 'arrival. The rain washes off the water-icemountain peaks of the hydrocarbon particles that settle on them, he added. Tomasko described the scenes showing lighter colors on the mountain tops and darker colors in the drainage areas as \"an Earth-like process, if you like, but with very exotic materials.\" Surface temperatures on Titan were measured at -179 degrees Celsius, which is about what scientists had expected. Little sunlit penetrates the dense hydrocarbon atmosphere, a fact that was only partly offset by Huygens' 20-watt lamp, which enabled the probe to deliver relatively clear pictures even on the surface.

The view is a composite of four nearly identical wide-angle camera images, all taken using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 939 nanometers. The individual images have been combined and contrast-enhanced in such a way as to sharpen surface features and enhance overall brightness variations. Some of the territory in this view was covered by observations made by the Cassini synthetic aperture radar in October 2004 and February 2005. At large scales, there are similarities between the views taken by the imaging science subsystem cameras and the radar results, but there also are differences. For example, the center of the floor of the approximately 80-kilometer-wide crater identified by the radar team in February is relatively bright at 2.2 centimeters, the wavelength of the radar experiment, but dark in the near- infrared wavelengths used here by Cassini's optical cameras. This brightness difference is also apparent for some of the surrounding material and could indicate differences in surface composition or roughness. Such comparisons, as well as information from observations acquired by the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer at the same time as the optical camera observations, are important in trying to understand the nature of Titan's surface materials. The images for this composite view were taken with the Cassini spacecraft on March 31, 2005, at distances ranging from approximately 146,000 to 130,000 kilometers from Titan and at a Sun-Titan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of about 57 degrees.

These findings may lead scientists to revise the theories that methane in Titan's atmosphere is mainly due to the presence of a methane-rich hydrocarbon ocean. Infrared images taken by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on board the NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini orbiter, show a bright, 30-kilometre-wide structure. This structure, imaged during the first Titan fly-by on 26 October 2004 from a distance of 1200 kilometres, could be interpreted as a volcanic dome formed by upwelling plumes of icy material that rose to the planet's surface. While melting, the icy material contaminated by hydrocarbons would release methane gas. The eruptions of such an ice-volcano, or 'cryo-volcano', would be caused by the heat generated during tidal movements of material inside Titan. Internal tides at Titan are expected as this moon strongly varies its distance from Saturn while it runs along its highly elliptical orbit around the mother planet. The images of the observed area also show that liquid is not visible on the surface. This conclusion is reinforced by the comparison of surface features imaged by VIMS with similar features imaged by ESA's Huygens probe during its descent and eventual landing onto Titan's soil. \"Before Cassini-Huygens, the most widely accepted explanation for the presence of methane in Titan's atmosphere was the presence of a methane-rich hydrocarbon ocean,\" said Dr Christophe Sotin, from the University of Nantes, France, and lead author of the results. \"The suite of instruments on board Cassini and the observations at the Huygens landing site reveal that a global ocean is not present. Interpreting this feature as a 'cryo-volcano' provides an alternative explanation for the presence of methane in Titan's atmosphere,\" he added. An infrared instrument like VIMS is able to peer through Titan's dense haze and provide information about the chemical composition and the topography of the surface. The highest resolution image obtained covers an area 150 square kilometres that includes the bright 30-kilometre circular feature, with two elongated wings extending westward. This structure actually resembles volcanic structures on Earth and Venus, with overlapping layers of material from a series of flows, although the volcanic material is different. In the centre of the area, scientists clearly see a dark feature that can be interpreted as a depression. So, it is easy to imagine it as a volcanic caldera, a bowl-shaped structure formed above chambers of molten material. If the cryo-volcanism hypothesis is true, the black channels seen by Huygens during its descent could have been formed by the large release of methane-rich rains following the eruptions. Scientists have already considered, and ruled out, other interpretations for the circular structure. In principle, it could be a cloud, but images taken at different times show that the structure does not vary its shape. A second interpretation would suggest that the structure is an accumulation of solid particles transported by gas or liquid, as it happens for sand dunes on Earth. However, a circular shape does not really match with this process, and its possible wind patterns do not match with the expected wind directions on Titan. Radar observations of the same regions to be made later by Cassini will certainly help to confirm these findings.

Many processes that occur on Earth also take place on this moon, say scientists participating in the US-European Cassini-Huygens mission. Wind, rain, volcanism and tectonic activity all seem to play a role in shaping Titan's surface. One scientist even sees a way that life could survive on the freezing world. \"Titan is perhaps the most Earth-like place in the Solar System other than Earth, in terms of the balance of processes,\" says Jonathan Lunine, of the University of Arizona, US, who is an interdisciplinary scientist for Cassini- Huygens. \"Wind-driven processes, river channels, evidence of rain, possible lakes and geological features that may have to do with volcanism and tectonism.\" Different chemistry But the chemistry that drives these processes is radically different between the two worlds. For example, methane seems to perform many of the same roles on Titan that water plays on Earth. Dr Lunine believes that Earth and Titan both have similar processes occurring because they occupy \"sweet spots\" in the Solar System. Being in one these spots requires striking a balance between size, or mass, and distance from the Sun. To demonstrate the idea, Dr Lunine considered three planets in the inner Solar System: Venus, Earth and Mars. The mass of a body corresponds to an ability to sustain heat flow from its interior, while distance from the Sun is correlated with the ability to retain liquid water, a driver of geological activity on Earth. Venus is about the same size as Earth. But it is so close to the Sun that any water it had must have boiled off. As such, there is no hydrological cycle and no tectonic activity, says Lunine. Mars is distant enough from the Sun to retain water. But its small size caused it to cool quickly, turning water to ice and ending large-scale geological activity. Earth occupies an intermediate position - the \"sweet spot\". The researcher then turned to three bodies in the outer Solar System: Ganymede, Titan and Triton. The chemistry is different, but similar principles apply. Jupiter's moon Ganymede, the closest of the three to the Sun, is similar in size to Titan, but lacks the methane and nitrogen that drive liquid processes on the Saturnian moon: \"It's a kind of baked out version of Titan,\" said Lunine. Neptune's moon Triton, much further from the Sun than both Ganymede and Titan, possesses methane and nitrogen. But its small size caused them to freeze, ending any prospect of geological activity. Scientists have been revealing new details about Titan at the meeting in Cambridge. Ralph Lorenz of the University of Arizona, US, said that the river channels and flows on Titan were fashioned by \"monsoon\" events. 'Catastrophic rains'. It takes a relatively long time for methane to build up to a point where it can rain down on Titan's surface. Scientists, therefore, think rains are only occasional, but catastrophic, when they occur. Evidence also suggests Titan is constantly being resurfaced by a fluid mixture of water and ammonia spewed out by volcanoes and hot springs, explaining why Titan is not littered with impact craters like its neighbours. A surface feature called Ganesa Macula may show just such a flow emanating from a volcanic crater. The moon's icy surface is also covered with a film, or patina, of organic compounds, Cassini-Huygens data shows. One researcher has even proposed a way for life to survive on the giant Saturnian satellite. It is too cold for organisms to survive on the surface of Titan, where temperatures are about -178C. But David Grinspoon, of the Southwest Research Institute, US, says organisms could occupy specific niches, such as hot springs. They could use acetylene, in reaction with hydrogen gas, to release enough energy to power metabolism, and possibly to heat their environments. The Cassini spacecraft entered orbit around Saturn on 1 July, 2004, on a mission to explore the ringed planet and its satellites. In December, it released the piggybacked Huygens probe on a collision course with Titan. Two weeks later, Huygens tumbled through the moon's atmosphere and made a successful touchdown on the surface. New results from the mission were presented at the American Astronomical Society Division of Planetary Sciences meeting in Cambridge, UK.

Surface images even show gravel-sized pieces of water ice that resemble rounded stones lying in a dry riverbed on Earth. But with a surface temperature of minus 179 degrees Celsius and an atmospheric pressure 1 1/2 times that of Earth, could fluvial processes on Titan be anything like those on Earth? \"The idea that rivers of methane moving chunks of ice on Titan ought to obey the same rules as rivers on Earth is not what you would assume at first,\" said Gary Parker, the W. H. Johnson Professor of Geology and a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"However, if river dynamics are truly understood at a physical level, then relations that provide reasonable results on Earth ought to provide similarly reasonable results on Titan.\" Parker, who has collected data from rivers all over the world, has calculated what should be key similarities and key differences between river networks on Earth and Titan. There are only three parameters that differ significantly between Earth and Titan, Parker said. First is the acceleration due to gravity - on Titan it is about one-seventh the value on Earth. Second is the viscosity of flowing fluid - the viscosity of liquid methane on Titan is about one-fifth that of water on Earth. Third is the submerged specific gravity of sediment - the value on Titan is about two-thirds of that on Earth. \"What this means is that for the same discharge of liquid methane as to water, the channel characteristics on Titan should be remarkably similar to those on Earth,\" Parker said. \"However, because of the smaller acceleration due to gravity, channel slopes on Titan should be wider, deeper and less steep than those on Earth.\" Wildcards that make Parker's predictions tentative include a freeze-thaw process of methane that might not be analogous to the freeze-thaw process of water on Earth, and the formation of hydrocarbons on Titan that might add a kind of cohesion not encountered on Earth. \"The interaction of sunlight with a hydrocarbon rich atmosphere could possibly precipitate very sticky compounds that could give streams on Titan a degree of cohesion that makes them behave differently,\" Parker said. If the underlying physics has been captured correctly, Parker's correlations could be used to predict river features not just on Earth and Titan, but elsewhere as well; revealing the internal consistency of fluvial processes at work under vastly different conditions. \"We are now receiving images from Mars that show relic rivers. But these analogues to what has happened on Earth are very, very old and the processes may not have been very strong,\" Parker said. \"What is happening on Titan, however, may be every bit as active and exciting as what is happening on Earth.\" Parker will present his findings at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, Dec. 5-9.

European Space Agency Science Director David Southwood was referring to mission-related suspense when he referred to 2005 as \"a nail-biting year. And now we're beginning to take delivery of the results of what we are doing.\" The January success of the Huygens descent, part of the large U.S.-European Cassini-Huygens mission, continues to produce science data nearly a year later. Jean-Pierre Lebreton, ESA's Huygens project manager, said the initial engineering feat of deploying the Huygens system and receiving the data now is yielding the stage to the data scientists wanted about Huygens' surface and atmosphere. \"We indeed had an engineering success and we are converting it into a scientific success,\" Lebreton said during a Nov. 30 presentation of early Huygens results. It will be several months before the full harvest of Huygens data is completed and at least that long as well before the findings of ESA's Mars Express orbiter come fully into view. The U.S.-provided Marsis radar on Mars Express has begun to peer several kilometers beneath the surface. But it will not begin what is expected to be its most promising investigations of Mars until next spring. Mars Express' mission is centered on the search for large water or water-ice deposits and evidence of current or past life. The satellite's high-resolution stereo camera already has collected a half-terabyte--500 gigabytes--of compressed raw data, which when treated is equivalent to 5 terabytes. Gerhard Neukum, the camera's principal investigator, said 25 percent of Mars' surface already has been mapped with a ground resolution of 20 meters or better. ESA's Science Program Committee has extended Mars Express financing to permit operations through 2007. Agustin Chicarro, ESA's Mars Express project scientist, said the satellite is likely to stay healthy to permit operations at least through 2010--funding permitting--and perhaps longer. Scientists are generally hesitant to talk about funding issues, even if budget limits are never far from their thoughts. On that score the news was generally good in 2005. The Science Program Committee agreed to extend the Integral gamma-ray astronomy satellite's mission to December 2010, and also agreed to permit the XMM-Newton X-ray observatory to operate until March 2010. The satellites were launched in 2002 and 1999, respectively. The sun-observing Soho satellite, launched in December 1995, originally designed for a two-year mission, is expected to continue in service until 2007, permitting it to complete operations during an entire solar-activity cycle of 11 years. ESA's unusually failure-free record in science missions--the loss of the Cluster satellites in 1996 in a launch failure was compensated by a rebuild and later launch of the mission--was nearly blemished in 1998 when Soho managers lost contact with the satellite for a month. Ground teams including prime contractor EADS Astrium subsequently returned Soho to operations despite the loss of its gyroscopes. The Venus Express satellite launched Nov. 9 continued the run of successful launches and early operations. It is expected to reach orbit around Venus in April. European scientists say these missions are the fruit of investments made years --sometimes more than a decade--ago at a time when Europe's space science was growing. That has not been the case for several years. ESA government ministers agreed Dec. 6 to partially remedy the problem by permitting a 2.5-percent annual increase in the science budget between 2006 and 2010. Some officials hope the budget adjustment will permit Europe's science program to slightly increase its buying power with respect to inflation. Others say it is equivalent to a flat budget. Southwood said it is likely that one large ESA science mission now being planned will have to be delayed or canceled to permit the program to build its other missions and leave aside funds for unanticipated needs. The Herschel and Planck astronomy satellites, which already are well over budget and a year behind schedule, are considered candidates for cancellation. They now are booked for a launch together on an Ariane 5 rocket the first half of 2008. The Science Program Committee is likely to determine in 2006 which future mission will be sacrificed.

Yet all journeys must have an end and Cassini's eventual fate is now being discussed. \"Current planning is for a two year mission extension that ends on July 1, 2010,\" said Robert Mitchell, NASA's Cassini mission program manager. \"However, presuming that the spacecraft continues to function well, it's reasonable to expect that one or more further extensions will be supported.\" Sometime around 2012, Cassini, like the ocean-going ships of old, will need to be decommissioned. However, the spacecraft cannot be towed to some nearby shore to be dismantled; she must either drop anchor, be scuttled, or cast off her gravitational moorings altogether. \"Perhaps the most likely option is to leave Cassini in a long-lived orbit that would have little to no risk of ever hitting anything,\" Mitchell said. \"Another is to impact Saturn like Galileo did at Jupiter, although there are some complications with this one.\" The complications arise from the beautiful wafer-thin rings that girdle the planet and the fact that in order to dive into Saturn, Cassini would have to pass through them-a risky maneuver that could render the spacecraft uncontrollable. Crash landing? \"Another option is to identify one of Saturn's icy moons as an acceptable candidate and impact the spacecraft onto it,\" Mitchell said. Yet this option also holds an inherent risk arising from the three plutonium bearing Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators Cassini uses as a power source. \"The issue is the heat that would be generated by the RTGs and the environment that would be created that could be conducive to the viability of any Earth organisms that might have survived on the spacecraft to that point,\" says Mitchell. Mission planners make great effort not to contaminate alien worlds with terrestrial life. The third option: raise anchor and escape the Saturn system altogether. Such a maneuver would require numerous flybys of Saturn's largest moon Titan to sling the spacecraft free of the ringed planet's environs. If Cassini were to be cut adrift in this manner, her controllers have two further choices: either bring her sunward or let her escape deeper into the outer solar system. Many options Should Cassini be directed back toward the inner solar system it is likely her final port of call would be Jupiter, Mitchell explained, \"One possibility is to escape Saturn and then most likely put the spacecraft on an impacting trajectory with Jupiter. This appears to be feasible, but the flight times get to be rather long.\" Cassini's leisurely final journey need not end at Jupiter; rather the giant planet's gravity could fling Cassini into position for an impact on Mercury. Such an impact would provide valuable data on the composition of Mercury's surface and could feasibly occur around 2021 to be observed by the BepiColombo spacecraft. Alternatively, if Cassini were cast into the solar system's outer depths there is a small chance she may provide further scientific reward in the form of a flyby of an outer planet or Kuiper Belt object. \"Some very preliminary analysis indicates that this might be possible. However, the flight times involved and the status of spacecraft consumables at that time make anything like this quite an unlikely option,\" says Mitchell. NASA is to make the final decision on Cassini's eventual fate later in the mission.

The vision now emerging of Saturn's largest moon, with its giant dunes and oceanless surface, is perhaps a glimpse of Earth's desert future. \"Titan may be very different from Earth today, but maybe not Earth tomorrow,\" Jonathan Lunine, Cassini-Huygens interdisciplinary scientist at the University of Arizona, told SPACE.com. The surface of Titan was a total mystery before the Huygens probe infiltrated past its dense hazy atmosphere in 2005. After a seven-year voyage aboard the Cassini spacecraft, Huygens spent roughly two-and-a-half hours parachuting down and then sent transmissions from Titan's surface for another 70 minutes before Cassini moved out of range. The mission was a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. \"Even though we have only four hours of data, it is so rich that after two years of work we have yet to retrieve all the information it contains,\" says Fran\u00e7ois Raulin, Huygens interdisciplinary scientist at the Laboratory of Environmental Physics and Chemistry in Paris. Lunine explained that \"a number of instruments aboard Huygens simply require quite a lot of calibration and cross-checking to get a sensible result.\" Episodic rain Stereoscopic images from Huygens now reveal extremely rugged terrain in the bright highlands north of the probe's landing site. This includes channels divided by ridges that can rise some 500 to 650 feet high, with slopes of 30 degrees. Their shapes suggest they are drainage channels, cut by liquid methane falling as rain, findings detailed in a special issue of Planetary and Space Science magazine. \"Rains on deserts on Earth can take be spaced by months to years, but on Titan we're talking about hundreds, maybe thousands, of years between episodes of major rainfall that comes down perhaps violently,\" Lunine said. \"Because Titan is so much farther from the sun than Earth is, it takes longer for solar energy to evaporate methane and build it up in the atmosphere enough to generate storms.\" The fact that methane apparently moves from the atmosphere to the surface and back again on Titan just as water does on Earth makes Titan \"in some ways the best analog for an Earth-like planet we have,\" Lunine said, as compared to Mars, which has too tenuous an atmosphere, or Venus, which has just the opposite. \"Essentially all the processes we see in Titan are in some sense connected with methane, just as processes on Earth are in some sense involved with water.\" Desert world Before Huygens penetrated Titan's haze, scientists suspected oceans of liquid methane and ethane covered its surface, evaporation from which could explain the smog-like compounds in its atmosphere. Instead, they found giant dunes likely composed of sugar-sized hydrocarbon grains girdling its equator, each stretching up to 60 miles long across dark plains that bear markings suggesting occasional flash flooding. Any surface lakes and seas might be confined to Titan's polar regions. \"There's a sense here of a desert world. Not in terms of being hot-Titan is very cold-but in terms of being very dry,\" Lunine said. \"Titan lacks oceans, but someday Earth will, too, as the sun increases in brightness, boiling the oceans away and leaving Earth a desert planet.\" Mysteries remain as to where the liquid that carved Titan's valleys, channels and gullies is hiding. Enigmatic radio waves Huygens detected could help reveal this liquid is hiding in the deep interior of Titan, perhaps released by geysers or vulcanism. The probe's Permittivity, Waves and Altimetry sensor detected an extremely low frequency radio wave during Huygens' descent. If this signal is natural and not accidentally generated by the instrument, studying how ELF waves resonate on Titan could shed light on any oceans that may exist below Titan's surface and how deep they are. Researchers have already ruled out electrical interference from the instrument itself. As to what may have generated this ELF wave in the first place, no one is quite sure yet. \"It might be generated by an interaction with Saturn's magnetosphere or related to Titan's intrinsic fields,\" suggested Fernando Sim\u00f5es, a member of the PWA team. \"Titan is proving to be an intriguing environment.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/3923-earth-future-glimpsed-titan.html"}, {"title": "Object of Interest", "date": "2007-06-25", "content": "The Cassini spacecraft spies an intriguing bright clump in Saturn's F ring.

Rather, its features are all stark blackand white. The appearance has long puzzled astronomers. Newdetailed images suggest sunlight is melting ice on one side of Iapetus, leavingthe moon's dark surface exposed, while the opposite half retains its reflectiveice-mixed shell. Since themoon's discovery by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1671, Iapetus' appearance hasbaffled astronomers. The leading edge of Iapetus, which faces the direction ofits orbit, is black as asphalt, while its trailingside appears bright as snow. Iapetus is 907 miles wideand circles Saturn at a distance of about 2.2 million miles. High-resolutionimages of Iapetus acquired last month by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft during itslow pass over the moon have uncovered telling details on its surface that maywell yield the reason for its strange brightand dark patterns. 'While there are many details yet to be worked out, we think we now understand theessence of why Iapetus looks the way it does,' said Carolyn Porco, theleader of the imaging team at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. The newobservations add support to a two-part explanation for Iapetus' appearance. First,as Iapetus treks around Saturn, itsleading edge scoops up a thin coating of dark material, which amplifiessunlight absorption. ?Dustymaterial spiraling in from outer moons hits Iapetus head-on and causes theforward-facing side of Iapetus to look different than the rest of themoon,? said Tilmann Denk, Cassini imaging scientist at the Free Universityin Germany. Over time,as the black-ish surfaces warm, the rate of evaporation increases until finallyall the surface ice in that region melts away. Infrared observations from the Cassiniflyby confirm the dark dust material is approximately -230 degrees Fahrenheit --warm enough for the release of water vapor from the ice. The water vaporformed then condenses on the nearest cold spot, such as along polar regions andicy areas at lower latitudes on the trailing side of the moon. In that way, thedark material loses the mixed-in ice and gets even darker, while the brightmaterial accumulates more ice and gets brighter, in what the astronomers call arunaway process that leaves no gray area.

Cassini mission sees seasonal changes", "date": "2009-06-03", "content": "The continuous monitoring of Titan's atmosphere by the Cassini mission, which has been exploring the Saturnian system since July 2004, is starting to reveal seasonal changes in the atmospheric circulation and shedding new light on the global climatology of the biggest moon of the ringed planet. In a study that's being published in this week's issue of Nature , planetary scientists examined over 10,000 images captured by the Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer instrument onboard Cassini, taken between July 2004 and December 2007. The study was conducted by an international team led by Sebastien Rodriguez of the University of Nantes in France. They spotted over 200 individual cloud activities in their data and analyzed the clouds' spatial distribution, temporal variance, and spectral characteristics. Some of these individual events, including rain, have been previously reported, but the new report is the first time the global climatology of the satellite was examined with the intent of identifying seasonal changes in Titan's atmosphere. It's the sort of study that's enabled by the vast observational data that the spacecraft has accumulated over the years. Clouds on Titan are extremely difficult to detect, because the thick stratospheric haze layer hides everything underneath, including any weather events and surface features. The high-altitude haze was discovered by the Voyager probes, which flew by Saturn in 1980-81 and were the only previous spacecraft to return close-range images of Titan before Cassini. Since then, scientists have realized that there are a few wavelength bands in the infrared range that can peer through the thick haze layer, and the first map of the surface was made in 1994 when the Hubble Space Telescope peered through one of these so- called spectral windows. Even with the advances in observational techniques, the studies of Titan's atmospheric circulation have been largely derived from climate models prior to the arrival of Cassini, as the observational data completely lacked spatial resolution and temporal coverage. Even with today's state-of-the-art technologies, almost all clouds on Titan remain undetectable from ground- or space-based telescopes. So, scientists applied what little they knew about the moon-solar intensity, atmospheric composition, the rotation rate, and the orbital parameters-to predict the atmospheric conditions. One of the most significant findings from these modeling efforts is that, with its day 15 times longer than on Earth, the slow rotation rate of Titan should cause its atmospheric circulation to differ radically from that of Earth. On Earth, the solar heat received near the equator is transported poleward through a large scale circulation system called the Hadley cells, which start at the equator and extend to about the 35 degree latitudes, making for two large symmetric convection cells in each hemisphere. On Titan, scientists predict that the slow rotation rate weakens the Coriolis effect, which limits the latitudinal extent of the Hadley circulation on Earth. This means that, on Titan, a single Hadley cell can straddle the equator and transport the heat directly from the summer hemisphere to the winter hemisphere. As a result, Titan is expected to have one gigantic pole- to-pole convection cell. To date, this prediction, originally made in 1995, has not been confirmed. The new study is the first to compare the observed global cloud patterns to the models' predictions. Right now, Titan is in late northern winter and approaching an equinox in August 2009, when the northern hemisphere spring will begin; i.e., the summer and winter hemispheres will switch. So, if the predicted pole-to-pole Hadley circulation actually exists on Titan, the direction of the circulation should reverse around the time of the equinoxes. The scientists are looking for early signs of this circulation reversal in the data collected so far by Cassini. In the new report, Rodriguez et al. show that many of the clouds observed by Cassini are consistent with the climate model predictions. As predicted, clouds are seen where the ascending point of the Hadley circulation should be in the southern mid-latitudes. Cumulus clouds are also observed at the south pole, where the pole-to-pole circulation should drive methane storms. Stable clouds are found around the north polar region, where the stratospheric ethane should condense in the cold winter polar night. On the other hand, the timing of the cloud events predicted by the models seem to be a little off. The models indicate that the cloud activities in the southern hemisphere should be weakening as the equinox approaches. Although the frequency of the southern hemisphere cloud events show hints of a decline, the south polar clouds should have completely disappeared by now according to the models' predictions, so the observed behaviors are different from the predicted gradual decline. The models also predict the presence of mid-latitude clouds in the northern hemisphere, but none are observed. The discrepancies between predictions and observations are important clues that should improve our understanding of Titan's atmospheric circulation. The authors reason that the timing of the drop in southern hemisphere cloud activity is a hint that the climate model does not yet incorporate all the seasonal heating effects the real system has. This points us to what should be the next steps in understanding what drives the atmospheric circulation on Titan. The absence of northern mid-latitude clouds also suggest that the pole- to-pole Hadley cell is more efficient than previously thought at transporting heat from the summer hemisphere to the winter one. The plans for the Cassini orbiter, which is currently in its first extended- mission phase, will have it continue its mission at least past the equinox to 2010. After that, an extended-extended mission is currently under development, which will hopefully stretch the orbiter's activities until the solstice in 2017, as the spacecraft is in excellent health and plenty of propellant is left onboard to continue the mission. With all the weather activities we are familiar with, including haze, cloud and rain, Titan makes an interesting case study for comparisons with Earth. The basic physics revealed through studying Earth should also be applicable to Titan, and what we learn from Titan must, of course, also apply to Earth. The continuing Cassini mission demonstrates that Titan is an excellent laboratory to challenge our understanding of the physics of climate.

Methane lakes dot Titan's surface, also at high latitudes. Closer to the moon's equator, by contrast, clouds appear rarely if at all, and the surface seems arid. But in January 2005, the Huygens probe, after detaching from the Cassini spacecraft and descending through Titan's atmosphere, gave planetary scientists their first close-up view of the moon's surface. Huygens imaged small channels and river beds at low latitudes, in regions that scientists had assumed to be devoid of flowing liquids that could carve such features. Now, astronomers working at Earth-based telescopes have for the first time observed, near Titan's equator, large and persistent clouds that might be capable of raining liquid methane onto the surface. Titan's equatorial plane is tilted at about 27 degrees from the plane of the solar system. That creates seasons, as the apparent position of the sun in Titan's sky ranges from 27 degrees north of its equator to 27 degrees south during the course of Saturn's 30-year orbit. Using adaptations of the computer models used to study Earth's climate, planetary scientists have found that clouds are most likely to form predominantly at Titan's poles during polar summers, when the sun is high in the sky in those regions. Only at those times, the models suggest, is the sun's heat enough to drive atmospheric convections that will send methane-laden \"air\" upward, where the methane will cool and condense to produce clouds. That predicted pattern is broadly consistent with observations to date, which indicate that clouds on Titan are generally sparse, typically covering less than 1 percent of the moon's visible surface area, and concentrated toward the poles. But in September 1995, and October 2004, cloud coverage rose as high as 7 percent for periods of up to a month, episodes that may have produced significant amounts of methane rain. To better understand these sporadic events, Emily Schaller of the University of Hawaii and her colleagues at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., and the California Institute of Technology began a project to regularly monitor cloud coverage on Titan. At visible wavelengths, Titan's hazy atmosphere--whose surface pressure is about one and half times that of Earth's--gives it a fuzzy, opaque appearance. At certain infrared wavelengths, however, the atmosphere is transparent while methane clouds are highly reflective. Schaller and her colleagues used NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, situated on Hawaii's Mauna Kea, to check Titan's infrared brightness as many nights as they could. IRTF measures the brightness of Titan as a whole, so when it revealed an increase in infrared reflectivity, the team turned to another telescope, Gemini North, to see where on Titan that infrared light was coming from. Gemini North, also on Mauna Kea, is one of a pair of 8-meter infrared telescopes funded in part by the National Science Foundation; its twin is Gemini South in the Chilean Andes. The Gemini telescopes achieve high resolution through the use of adaptive optics, meaning that the shape of their mirrors can be rapidly tweaked to overcome the blurring of images that results from light passing through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. In just over two years, the Titan monitoring program acquired 138 nights of observations, and on April 13, 2008, Schaller says, the effort finally paid off. After IRTF reported brightening of the moon, observations by Gemini North revealed cloud cover extending across the moon's middle latitudes, from 14 degrees south to 44 degrees south. Over the next few days, this large cloud spread southward, until on April 17, Titan's rotation took it out of view from Earth. The following day clouds appeared at even lower latitudes, from 20 degrees south to 12 degrees south--closer to the equator than clouds had ever been seen before. Clouds also appeared in the polar regions. A similar pattern recurred about a week later, as the large mid-latitude cloud rotated back into view again. Schaller and her colleagues offer a theoretical argument indicating that the initial mid-latitude cloud formation could have triggered the formation of clouds in both the polar and equatorial regions via large-scale atmospheric waves. Such waves occur in Earth's atmosphere and are known to propagate weather systems around the globe. The equatorial clouds seem substantial enough, the astronomers say in the August 13 issue of Nature , to produce methane rains that could, from time to time, create and shape the channels and apparent riverbeds imaged by Huygens. What remains puzzling, though, is why the mid-latitude cloud formed in the first place. Some surface features on Titan hint at the occurrence of \"cryovolcanism,\" in which water-ice melts and flows, perhaps also releasing methane that was trapped in the frozen surface. Rising heat and freed methane could both lead to the formation of clouds. But observations from Cassini show that the surface of Titan above which the mid-latitude cloud formed \"seems completely unremarkable,\" Schaller says. It's possible, she adds, that a convergence of purely atmospheric phenomena could have brought the initial cloud into being. Regardless of their origin, the possibility that clouds can form sporadically at almost all latitudes of Titan suggests that closer examination of its surface will reveal an abundance of features created by flows of liquid methane, Schaller says.

The flyby, which occurred April 27 at 8:10:17 p.m. EDT, took Cassini through the water-rich plume that flares out from Enceladus' south polarregion. At closest approach, Cassini was about 100 kilometers abovethe surface of Enceladus, at a speed of 15,000 mph relative to the moon. In a new Enceladus photo released by NASA, the moon lookslike a crisp orb in space with one end the south pole known to be home to icygeysers appearing hazy through the plumes there. Cassini'slow flyby would have been ideal for snapping new photos of Enceladus, but theprimary objective of the mission was to collect information for the gravityexperiment. Thenew photo, for example, is a raw, unprocessed image. \"Radioscience was prime through this flyby, meaning that it got to control spacecraftpointing, which precluded pointing the optical instruments at Enceladus,\"said Robert Mitchell, Cassini program manager. \"So, unfortunately, theimaging camera did not take up-close pictures.\" Instead, theimaging camera was only able to obtain more distant pictures. As part of Cassini's 26-hour gravity observation, a steadyradio link to NASA's Deep Space Network on Earth enabled Cassini scientists touse the radio instrument to measure the variations in the gravitational pull ofEnceladus. Detecting any changes will help scientists understand whatlies beneath Enceladus' famous \"tiger stripe\" fractures, which spewwater vapor and organic particles from the moon's southpolar region.

It appears flash flooding has paved streambeds in the Xanadu region of Saturn's moon Titan with thousands of sparkling crystal balls of ice, according to scientists with NASA's Cassini spacecraft. By analyzing the way the terrain has scattered radar beams, scientists deduce the spheres measure at least a few centimeters and maybe up to a couple of meters in diameter. The spheres likely originated as part of water-ice bedrock in higher terrain in Xanadu. \"What we believe happened in this area is a lot like what creates polished river rocks on Earth,\" said Alice Le Gall, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and the lead author of the study, which used the Cassini radar instrument. \"Bouncing downstream smoothes out the edges of rocks.\" As foothill residents know in southern California and other areas, sudden rains can trigger mudslides and flooding at the mountainous fringes of desert areas. Those flows can pick up boulders and debris and tumble them downstream. On Titan, the flows appear to have occurred periodically for eons, on a catastrophic scale. The process on Titan, however, involves rain made of liquid methane and ethane, rather than Earth's water rain. Titan's rocks are believed to be made primarily of water ice frozen into a hard mass about minus 180 degrees Celsius, rather than Earth's mineral rocks. Earth-like river rocks have already been observed on Titan at the landing site of the European Space Agency's Huygens probe, near the equator in the borderland between the Adiri and Shangri-la regions. The landing site also showed signs of flash flooding that deposited cobblestones about 2 to 20 centimeters in diameter. But the spidery channels in this southern lowland part of Xanadu looked brighter to Cassini's radar instrument than the Huygens landing area. In fact, the channels, which were scanned by Cassini in May 2008, are among the brightest features ever seen on Titan by the radar instrument. In a paper now available online in the journal Icarus, Le Gall and colleagues concluded that the most plausible explanation for the extreme brightness of the Xanadu channels was a collection of transparent spherical sediments, packed more tightly together than the cobblestones at the Huygens landing site. The effect would be similar to bejeweling an area with light-catching rhinestones. The spheres appear to be made of water ice - possibly doped with ammonia - that would look bright to the microwaves used by Cassini's radar. Spheres are good at sending light back in the direction it came from. This property has actually led manufacturers to use plastic spheres in reflective paints and tape, Le Gall said. Xanadu may be an especially good gem grinder because of its broad expanse and gentle southward slope. Flows could have traveled long distances there and tumbled the chunks for hundreds of kilometers. The subtle work to shape them into spheres could have come from fine grit rubbing against the rocks in the flowing methane. Or, ice may be malleable in Titan's cold temperatures, deforming plastically during the collisions rather than fracturing. The flows that transported these icy spheres probably traveled around 1 meter per second. \"It's been really hard for a long time for people to understand why Xanadu is so bright,\" said Steve Wall, a radar team member at JPL. \"You might not expect these kinds of geometries in a natural setting, but we believe this can explain the enigma.\" The radar team plans to continue looking for other instances of small, smooth spheres in nature to increase their confidence about the explanation. They also said more study is needed on the mechanical properties of water ice at such cold temperatures. \"Here is yet another example of Titan as a world with Earth-like processes,\" said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at JPL. \"As the seasons change on Titan, maybe we'll get a chance to see methane flow through some of the river channels.\" The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.

Results from the mission reveal that the atmosphere of Rhea, Saturn's second- largest moon at 900 miles wide, is extremely thin and is sustained by high-energy particles bombarding its icy surface and kicking up atoms, molecules, and ions into the atmosphere. The density of oxygen is probably about 5 trillion times less dense than it is in Earth's atmosphere. However, the formation of oxygen and carbon dioxide could possibly drive complex chemistry on the surfaces of many icy bodies in the universe. \"The new results suggest that active, complex chemistry involving oxygen may be quite common throughout the solar system and even our universe,\" said Ben Teolis, a Cassini team scientist based at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. \"Such chemistry could be a prerequisite for life. All evidence from Cassini indicates Rhea is too cold and devoid of the liquid water necessary for life as we know it.\" \"The discovery of this tenuous atmosphere provides key information on how radiation can drive chemistry on icy surfaces throughout the universe,\" said Geraint Jones from UCL's Mullard Space Science Lab. Rhea's tenuous atmosphere makes it unique in the Saturn system. Titan has a thick nitrogen-methane atmosphere, with very little carbon dioxide and oxygen. UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory led the design and building of the electron spectrometer of the Cassini plasma spectrometer, which detected negative ions streaming off Rhea's surface in 2005. Another part of CAPS detected positive ions on the opposite side of Rhea in 2005 and 2007. Completing the picture of Rhea's atmosphere, Cassini's ion and neutral mass spectrometer detected neutral particles when Cassini swept within 60 miles of the moon's surface in March 2010. \"Our instrument turns out to be a fabulous detector of negative ions as well as electrons,\" said Andrew Coates, also from UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory. \"We've already found negative ions are important at Titan and Enceladus. And now, tracing back the trajectory of these ions really pinpoints the source of the atmosphere near Rhea's surface.\" The ion and neutral mass spectrometer detected peak densities of oxygen of around 1 billion molecules per cubic foot. It detected peak densities of carbon dioxide around 600 million molecules per cubic foot. The plasma spectrometer also saw clear signatures of flowing streams of positive and negative ions, with masses that corresponded to ions of oxygen and carbon dioxide. \"Rhea's oxygen appears to come from water ice on Rhea's surface when Saturn's magnetic field rotates over the moon and showers it with energetic particles trapped in the magnetic field,\" said Coates. The carbon dioxide may be the result of \"dry ice\" trapped from the primordial solar nebula, similar to the case of comets, or it may be due to similar irradiation processes operating on the organic molecules trapped in the water ice of Rhea. The carbon dioxide could also come from carbon-rich materials deposited by tiny meteors that bombarded Rhea's surface. The finding is consistent with earlier Cassini results that show Rhea to be a particularly dark-looking moon, sporting some carbon-based coating on its surface.

During the flyby, which will occur at 11:04 a.m. EST, Cassini will study the interactions between Titan and Saturn's magnetosphere, a magnetic bubble that surrounds the entire planet, according to a NASA description. Cassini should fly within 2,270 miles of Titan during today's flyby, which is the spacecraft's 75th trip by the moon. Previous flybys by the Cassini probe have revealed a rather tempestuous magnetic environment near Titan, one that is somewhat unpredictable, NASA scientists at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have said. This Titan flyby is valuable for probing Saturn's magnetosphere because of the location of the moon in its orbit. As Titan circles Saturn, the influence of sunlight and ionized gas inside the planet's magnetosphere changes, JPL officials said. \"These factors are important for understanding the relationship between Titan and Saturn's magnetosphere,\" JPL officials explained. \"It is important to make measurements at a variety of locations in the Saturn magnetosphere, so this flyby will occur in a part of the magnetosphere that has been poorly sampled so far.\" Cassini will study the ionized gas around Titan during the 12 hours immediately preceding closest approach, and then repeat the observations again after the flyby as Titan recedes in the background. But, Saturn's magnetosphere is not the only target for Cassini during today's flyby. The spacecraft will also use other science instruments to study Titan itself, including one tool that will take gravity measurements to probe the internal structure of the cloud-covered moon. \"Collecting data like these will eventually enable scientists to determine whether Titan has an ocean under its crust,\" JPL officials said. Titan's northern hemisphere is also currently experiencing the spring season, with summer fast approaching. So Cassini mission scientists hope to use today's flyby to spot changes in Titan's weather system, track its hydrocarbon lakes, as well as monitor the clouds and particles in the moon's atmosphere, JPL officials said. NASA's Cassini spacecraft launched in 1996 and arrived at Saturn in 2004. It also carried the European Space Agency's Huygens lander, which landed on Titan soon after Cassini arrived in orbit around Saturn. The spacecraft completed its primary mission to explore Saturn, its rings and moons in 2008. Since then, the Cassini mission to Saturn has been extended twice, most recently to 2017.

Titan has always stood out as the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere. In fact, the surface pressure on Titan is 50 percent greater than the pressure on Earth. The main ingredient of Titan's atmosphere is nitrogen, just as it is on Earth. Where this nitrogen came from has long been debated. For instance, it could be primordial, accumulating as Titan formed, or it could have originated later. Weighing the options. In 2005, the Huygens probe carried by NASA's Cassini spacecraft to Saturn ruled out a primordial origin for this nitrogen. Titan's atmosphere apparently has extremely low levels of the isotope argon-36, while high amounts are expected in an atmosphere rich in primordial nitrogen. There are a number of other explanations for how this atmospheric nitrogen might have formed after Titan's birth. For instance, sunlight in Titan's atmosphere might have broken apart ammonia, a molecule made of nitrogen and hydrogen. However, nearly all these suggestions require that Titan formed at relatively high temperatures, which would have led the moon to differentiate into a rocky core and an icy mantle layer, and Cassini's radar scans suggested that Titan is not fully differentiated. Comets loaded with nitrogen might have delivered it to Titan, but that would have also led to higher levels of argon-36 than currently seen. Now scientists in Japan suggest that countless numbers of asteroids and comets slamming into ammonia ice on Titan could have converted it to nitrogen gas several hundred million years after the moon's formation. \"Our results suggest that hypervelocity impacts have played a key role,\" researcher Yasuhito Sekine, a planetary scientist at the University of Tokyo, told SPACE.com. Solar system dodgeball. During an era known as the Late Heavy Bombardment about four billion years ago, the solar system was very much like a shooting gallery, with cosmic impacts regularly blasting planets and moons. To see if such impacts would deliver enough energy to convert ammonia ice to nitrogen, researchers used laser guns and \"bullets\" made of gold, platinum or copper foil. The beams vaporized the back of these bullets, propelling them at high speeds at targets made of ammonia and water ice. The researchers found \"ammonia is very easily converted to nitrogen molecule by impacts,\" Sekine said. They calculated that 330 million billion tons worth of impactors could have produced the current amount of nitrogen seen on Titan, \"a plausible mass of impactors during the Late Heavy Bombardment,\" noted planetary scientist Catherine Neish at Johns Hopkins University, who did not take part in this research. \"It's an interesting new hypothesis,\" Neish told SPACE.com. \"Differentiating between the different hypotheses will require a more detailed understanding of Titan's internal structure, and the composition of comets and-or other Saturnian satellites.\" She suggested that a future mission to a comet would very likely provide key evidence to help confirm or refute the idea. One question would be where all the craters from such impacts might be. Titan has only about 50 recognized craters, Neish said. \"Does this imply that Titan's surface is very young?\" she asked, suggesting a young surface could have covered up most of the craters on Titan. The scientists detailed their findings online May 8 in the journal Nature Geoscience.

Cassini mission managers decided to stop using the Saturn probe's plasma spectrometer on Tuesday following a series of unexpected voltage readings, NASA officials said Wednesday. The problem began on May 1, when an unexpected voltage shift was detected, officials at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement. That suggested a short circuit was at work, but when another event occured on June 11 it sugggested a second short circuit had occurred, they added. At all times Cassini's instruments and engineering systems continued working normally. \"Analysis of telemetry data from the spacecraft by the engineering team pointed to the Cassini plasma spectrometer instrument as the cause of the voltage shifts,\" JPL officials said, adding that the instrument has an extra set of capacitors in its power lines to reduce signal noise. \"The concern was that one or more of these capacitors may have short-circuited, which would cause the voltage to shift and explain the observed changes. Although the instrument was operating properly, engineers decided to turn it off as a precaution until the events could be better understood.\" The plasma spectrometer is one of 12 instruments the Cassini uses to study Saturn. The instrument is used to measure the energy and electrical charge of particles around Saturn. While Cassini's plasma spectrometer is offline, its 11 other instruments are expected to continue working normally. \"The plan is to resume normal plasma spectrometer operations after further analysis is completed to understand the cause of the issue better,\" JPL officials said.

This storm is the largest and most intense observed on Saturn by NASA's Voyager or Cassini spacecraft. The storm is still active. As scientists have tracked this storm over several months, they have found it covers 500 times the area of the biggest of the southern hemisphere storms observed earlier in the Cassini mission and PIA12576. The shadow cast by Saturn's rings has a strong seasonal effect, and it is possible that the switch to powerful storms now being located in the northern hemisphere is related to the change of seasons after the planet's August 2009 equinox. In an image captured Dec. 5, 2010, scientists saw a small white spot with a size of about 800 miles north-to-south and 1,600 miles east-to-west. In this view, taken on Dec. 24, 2010, the storm has grown to a north-to-south, or latitudinal, extent of about 6,000 miles three weeks after the storm started. The main part of the storm has an east-to-west, or longitudinal, extent of about 11,000 miles in this view. Other images taken at the same time show the tail extending almost one-third of the way around the planet - a distance of 62,000 miles. See PIA12825 for a false-color view taken about two months after this view, with the storm's tail encircling the planet and the latitudinal extent swollen to almost 9,000 miles. Periodic, huge storms called Great White Spots have been observed in previous Saturnian years, usually appearing in late northern summer. Saturn is now experiencing early northern spring, so this storm, if it is a Great White Spot, is happening earlier than usual. This storm is about as large as the largest of the Great White Spots, which also encircled the planet but had latitudinal sizes ranging up to 12,000 miles. The Voyager and Cassini spacecraft were not at Saturn for previous Great White Spot appearances. This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from just below the ring plane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters are usually combined to create a natural color view. Because a visible red light image was not available, an image taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 752 nanometers was used in place of red. So the color is close to natural color, but is not exact. The images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.2 million miles from Saturn and at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 71 degrees. Because the three images were of different resolutions, they were all projected to the same scale of about 89 miles per pixel.

Scientists analyzing data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft now have the first-ever, up-close details of a Saturn storm that is eight times the surface area of Earth. On Dec. 5, 2010, Cassini first detected the storm that has been raging ever since. It appears at approximately 35 degrees north latitude on Saturn. Pictures from Cassini's imaging cameras show the storm wrapping around the entire planet covering approximately 1.5 billion square miles. The storm is about 500 times larger than the biggest storm previously seen by Cassini during several months from 2009 to 2010. Scientists studied the sounds of the new storm's lightning strikes and analyzed images taken between December 2010 and February 2011. Data from Cassini's radio and plasma wave science instrument showed the lightning flash rate as much as 10 times more frequent than during other storms monitored since Cassini's arrival to Saturn in 2004. The data appear in a paper published this week in the journal Nature. \"Cassini shows us that Saturn is bipolar,\" said Andrew Ingersoll, an author of the study and a Cassini imaging team member at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. \"Saturn is not like Earth and Jupiter, where storms are fairly frequent. Weather on Saturn appears to hum along placidly for years and then erupt violently. I'm excited we saw weather so spectacular on our watch.\" At its most intense, the storm generated more than 10 lightning flashes per second. Even with millisecond resolution, the spacecraft's radio and plasma wave instrument had difficulty separating individual signals during the most intense period. Scientists created a sound file from data obtained on March 15 at a slightly lower intensity period. Cassini has detected 10 lightning storms on Saturn since the spacecraft entered the planet's orbit and its southern hemisphere was experiencing summer, with full solar illumination not shadowed by the rings. Those storms rolled through an area in the southern hemisphere dubbed \"Storm Alley.\" But the sun's illumination on the hemispheres flipped around August 2009, when the northern hemisphere began experiencing spring. \"This storm is thrilling because it shows how shifting seasons and solar illumination can dramatically stir up the weather on Saturn,\" said Georg Fischer, the paper's lead author and a radio and plasma wave science team member at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Graz. \"We have been observing storms on Saturn for almost seven years, so tracking a storm so different from the others has put us at the edge of our seats.\" The storm's results are the first activities of a new \"Saturn Storm Watch\" campaign. During this effort, Cassini looks at likely storm locations on Saturn in between its scheduled observations. On the same day that the radio and plasma wave instrument detected the first lightning, Cassini's cameras happened to be pointed at the right location as part of the campaign and captured an image of a small, bright cloud. Because analysis on that image was not completed immediately, Fischer sent out a notice to the worldwide amateur astronomy community to collect more images. A flood of amateur images helped scientists track the storm as it grew rapidly, wrapping around the planet by late January 2011. The new details about this storm complement atmospheric disturbances described recently by scientists using Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. The storm is the biggest observed by spacecraft orbiting or flying by Saturn. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images in 1990 of an equally large storm.

A new analysis of radar data from NASA's Cassini mission, in partnership with the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency, has revealed regional variations among sand dunes on Saturn's moon Titan. The result gives new clues about the moon's climatic and geological history. Dune fields are the second most dominant landform on Titan, after the seemingly uniform plains, so they offer a large-scale insight into the moon's peculiar environment. The dunes cover about 13 percent of the surface, stretching over an area of 4 million square miles. For Earthly comparison, that's about the surface area of the United States. Though similar in shape to the linear dunes found on Earth in Namibia or the Arabian Peninsula, Titan's dunes are gigantic by our standards. They are on average 0.6 to 1.2 miles wide, hundreds of miles long and around 300 feet high. However, their size and spacing vary across the surface, betraying the environment in which they have formed and evolved. Using radar data from the Cassini spacecraft, Alice Le Gall, a former postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., who is currently at the French research laboratory LATMOS, Paris, and collaborators have discovered that the size of Titan's dunes is controlled by at least two factors: altitude and latitude. In terms of altitude, the more elevated dunes tend to be thinner and more widely separated. The gaps between the dunes seem to appear to Cassini's radar, indicating a thinner covering of sand. This suggests that the sand needed to build the dunes is mostly found in the lowlands of Titan. Scientists think the sand on Titan is not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid hydrocarbons, precipitated out of the atmosphere. These have then aggregated into grains 0.04 inch in size by a still unknown process. In terms of latitude, the sand dunes on Titan are confined to its equatorial region, in a band between 30 degrees south latitude and 30 degrees north latitude. However, the dunes tend to be less voluminous toward the north. Le Gall and colleagues think that this may be due to Saturn's elliptical orbit. Titan is in orbit around Saturn, and so the moon's seasons are controlled by Saturn's path around the sun. Because Saturn takes about 30 years to complete an orbit, each season on Titan lasts for about seven years. The slightly elliptical nature of Saturn's orbit means that the southern hemisphere of Titan has shorter but more intense summers. So the southern regions are probably drier, which implies they have less ground moisture. The drier the sand grains, the more easily they can be transported by the winds to make dunes. \"As one goes to the north, we believe the soil moisture probably increases, making the sand particles less mobile and, as a consequence, the development of dunes more difficult.\" says Le Gall. Backing this hypothesis is the fact that Titan's lakes and seas are not distributed symmetrically by latitude. These reserves of liquid ethane and methane are predominantly found in the northern hemisphere, suggesting again that the soil is moister toward the north and so, again, the sand grains are less easy to transport by the wind. \"Understanding how the dunes form as well as explaining their shape, size and distribution on Titan's surface is of great importance to understanding Titan's climate and geology because the dunes are a significant atmosphere- surface exchange interface\", says Nicolas Altobelli, ESA's Cassini-Huygens project scientist. \"In particular, as their material is made out of frozen atmospheric hydrocarbon, the dunes might provide us with important clues on the still puzzling methane/ethane cycle on Titan, comparable in many aspects with the water cycle on Earth.\" The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C.

The images are the result of a new analysis of radar data from NASA's Cassini mission to Saturn. The scientists say these images give new clues about the climate and geology of Titan, which is our solar system's second-largest moon, the only moon with an atmosphere, and which has a bigger volume than the planet Mercury. Dune fields cover about 13 percent of Titan, or roughly the surface area of the United States. Scientists say Titan's dunes are similar to the some found in the earthly Republic of Namibia, which is in southwestern Africa. Namibia has some giant dunes - some reaching nearly 1,000 feet in height. Titan has some giant dunes as well. Even the average sized ones are 300 feet high, and the longitudinal dunes, which are always aligned with average wind direction, can stretch hundreds of miles across the surface of this alien moon. Yes, Titan has wind and rain of liquid methane, and, in addition to sand dunes, it has rivers, lakes and seas and shorelines. It has seasons and seasonal weather patterns. All of this is amazing news of recent years, since Titan's surface cannot be seen directly. It is hidden by this moon's dense atmosphere. But Cassini is equipped with radar, and that's where we get these images, and much of what we know of Titan. Scientists are now saying that the size and spacing of dunes on Titan has given them clues as to how the dunes formed and evolved. For example, the size of Titan's dunes appears to be controlled by at least two factors: latitude and altitude. Sand dunes on Titan are confined to low latitudes - in a band between 30 degrees south latitude and 30 degrees north latitude, with fewer dunes toward the north. Meanwhile, dunes at higher altitudes on Titan tend to be thinner and more widely separated, possibly with a thinner covering of sand. The dunes in the image above aren't on Titan. They're on Earth, in Namibia in southwestern Africa, in the Namib-Naukluft National Park, an ecological preserve in Namibia's vast Namib Desert. Earthly winds, blowing in from the Atlantic Ocean, create the tallest sand dunes on Earth here. They look similar, yes? That's because nature works the same way throughout space. If it didn't, by the way, we'd be at a loss to understand anything about what's around us in the cosmos. By the way, the Cassini orbiter has been weaving in and around Saturn and its moon since 2004. It has now far surpassed its original mission and is scheduled to remain in orbit until 2017.

For one thing, you wouldn't be able to breathe - Dione's atmosphere is 5 trillion times less dense than the air at Earth's surface, scientists say. Dione's atmosphere was detected by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which spotted an ultra-thin layer of oxygen ions so sparse that it is equivalent to conditions 300 miles above Earth. On Dione, there is just one oxygen ion one for every 0.67 cubic inches of space, but it's still enough to qualify as an atmosphere, Cassini mission scientists announced Friday. \"We now know that Dione, in addition to Saturn's rings and the moon Rhea, is a source of oxygen molecules,\" Cassini team member Robert Tokar of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, who led the new study, said in a statement. \"This shows that molecular oxygen is actually common in the Saturn system and reinforces that it can come from a process that doesn't involve life.\" Dione is one of Saturn's smaller moons and is about 698 miles wide. It orbits Saturn once every 2.7 days at a distance of about 234,000 miles - roughly the same as that between Earth and its moon, according to a NASA description. The oxygen on Dione may potentially be created by solar photons or high-energy particles that bombard the Saturn moon's ice-covered surface, kicking up oxygen ions in the process, Tokar explained. Another idea suggests that geologic processes on Dione could feed the moon's atmosphere, researchers added. The study is detailed in a recent issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Dione is by no means the only rocky body with an atmosphere in our solar system. Thick atmospheres cover the planets of Earth, Venus and Mars, as well as Saturn's largest moon Titan. A thin atmosphere on Saturn's moon Rhea - one similar to that of Dione - was also detected in 2010, NASA officials said. That observation and the discovery of ozone on Dione by the Hubble Space Telescope led researchers to suspect it may host a thin atmosphere. But it wasn't established for sure until the Cassini spacecraft used an instrument called a plasma spectrometer to detect the ionized oxygen on Dione during a close flyby in April 2011, when the probe flew within 313 miles of the icy moon. The spacecraft detected an atmosphere made up of about 2,550 oxygen ions per cubic foot, researchers said. \"Scientists weren't even sure Dione would be big enough to hang on to an exosphere, but this new research shows that Dione is even more interesting than we previously thought,\" said Amanda Hendrix, the deputy project scientist for Cassini at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., who did not participate in Tokar's study. \"Scientists are now digging through Cassini data on Dione to look at this moon in more detail.\" Dione was discovered in 1684 by astronomer Giovanni Cassini, after whom the Cassini spacecraft is named. The moon is named after the Greek goddess Dione, who the ancient Greek poet Homer described as the mother of the goddess Aphrodite, NASA officials explained.

It is designed to measure the energy and electrical charge of particles around Saturn. The spectrometer suffered an apparent short circuit last year and was switched off in June to avoid further damage while mission managers studied the glitch. \"The investigation led to the conclusion that tin plating on electronics components had grown \"whiskers,'\" NASA officials explained in a mission update Monday. \"The whiskers were very small, less than the diameter of a human hair, but they were big enough to contact another conducting surface and carry electrical current.\" Scientists still don't fully understand why the so-called metal whiskers develop on tin and other metal materials on spacecraft, as well as on machines on Earth. But the whiskers inside the Cassini electronics should not post a problem. \"It is believed that these or additional tin whiskers that may grow on Cassini cannot carry enough current to cause problems, but will burn out on their own like a lightweight fuse,\" explained NASA officials with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which oversees the Cassini mission. Cassini's odd metal whisker problem began on May 1, 2011, when engineers first detected surprising voltage changes in the spacecraft's equipment.

The theory that an underground ocean of liquid water is powering this southern plume makes Enceladus a potential spot for the existence of extraterrestrial microbial life. \"Though we've been in orbit around Saturn for nearly eight years now, we still continue to image these moons for mapping purposes and, in the case of Enceladus, to learn as much as we can about its famous jets and the subterranean, organic-rich, salty, liquid water chamber from which we believe they erupt,\" Carolyn Porco, leader of Cassini's Imaging Science team, wrote in a statement. Porco even suggested that the jets could be \" snowing microbes\" from Enceladus ' buried ocean out over its surface. \"In the end, it is the most promising place I know of for an astrobiology search,\" Porco said in a NASA interview. \"We don't even need to go scratching around on the surface. We can fly through the plume and sample it. Or we can land on the surface, look up and stick our tongues out. And voil\u00e0...we have what we came for.\" Later on Tuesday, Cassini swung by Janus, coming to a distance of 27,000 miles above the small moon. Janus is so tiny that it hasn't rounded into a spherical shape; rather, it is more like a pile of icy rubble. In the background of some of the new Janus pictures, Saturn can be seen shining. This raw image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft was taken on March 27, 2012. The camera was pointing toward Saturn's moon Enceladus at approximately 19,810 miles away. Then, on Thursday, Cassini neared the medium-sized Dione at about the same distance of 27,000 miles. The probe was able to capture nine separate frames that mosaic together to illustrate the moon's heavily cratered far side, which always faces away from Saturn. Cassini, a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency, launched in 1997 and entered orbit around Saturn in 2004. In 2005, it released the Huygens probe, which landed on the surface of the largest Saturnian moon, Titan. Cassini is set to make its next Enceladus flyby in a little over two weeks, on April 14.

The new Saturn ring photos come as the Cassini probe moves into a slightly different orbit around its gas giant target, officials with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in an image announcement. \"It's been nearly two years since NASA's Cassini spacecraft has had views like these of Saturn's glorious rings,\" JPL officials explained. \"These views are possible again because Cassini has changed the angle at which it orbits Saturn and regularly passes above and below Saturn's equatorial plane.\" The new view allows Cassini mission scientists to better study the shifting motions and intricacies of Saturn's rings, as well as the small moons that shape the rings. With Cassini in the new orbit, the mission team has revived a project aimed at studying odd propeller-like shapes in Saturn's rings, JPL officials said. The propeller features appear as parts of the rings are swept clean by strange particles that are larger than the actual ring particles, but smaller than the known moons of Saturn, they added. The Saturn ring propellers have not been seen in recent years because Cassini's orbit did not allow favorable views of the planet's rings. Since Cassini entered its new orbit, however, scientists have spotted propeller features that appear similar to ones observed in the past, NASA officials said. The orbit change will also allow Cassini to observe Saturn's polar regions while gaining a new perspective on the planet's many moons. \"We're entering a new episode in Cassini's exploratory voyage through the Saturn system,\" Carolyn Porco, imaging team lead, based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo., said in a statement. \"These new ring results are an early harbinger of great things to come.\" Cassini has been orbiting Saturn since it arrived in 2004.

The Cassini orbiter captured the daytime lightning on Saturn as bright blue spots inside a giant storm that raged on the planet last year. NASA unveiled the new Saturn lightning photos Wednesday, adding that the images came as a big surprise. \"We didn't think we'd see lighting on Saturn's day side -only its night side,\" said Ulyana Dyudina, a Cassini imaging team associate at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, in a statement. \"The fact that Cassini was able to detect the lightning means that it was very intense.\" Cassini spotted the daytime lightning while observing a giant Saturn storm on March 6, 2011. A blue filter on the spacecraft's main camera recorded the lightning flashes, and scientists then exaggerated the blue tint in order to pin down the lightning's location and size, researchers said. Cassini mission scientists said the lightning on Saturn was spotted across a region 100 miles wide where it exited the cloud layer. In all, Cassini spotted eight daytime lightning flashes on Saturn, five in one part of the storm and three in an another, they added. The lightning-spawning storm on Saturn was not a short-lived tempest. The storm wrapped completely around Saturn at its peak and is the longest-lived storm ever seen on the ringed planet. It began in December 2010 and lasted about 200 days, finally sputtering out in late June 2011. One mystery that remains is why the daytime Saturn lightning only turned up in Cassini's blue imaging filter. Scientists aren't sure if that means the lightning is actually blue in color, or if it's due to a short exposure time of the camera that helps the camera filter detect the lightning. \"As summer storm season descends upon Earth's northern latitudes, Cassini provides us a great opportunity to see how weather plays out at different places in our solar system,\" Cassini project scientist Linda Spilker, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement. \"Saturn's atmosphere has been changing over the eight years Cassini has been at Saturn, and we can't wait to see what happens next.\" NASA's Cassini spacecraft launched in 1997 and has been orbiting Saturn since 2004.

Saturn's largest moon appeared through telescopes as a hazy orange orb, in contrast to other heavily cratered moons in the solar system. In 2004, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft - a probe that flies by Titan as it orbits Saturn - penetrated Titan's haze, providing scientists with their first detailed images of the surface. Radar images revealed an icy terrain carved out over millions of years by rivers of liquid methane, similar to how rivers of water have etched into Earth's rocky continents. While images of Titan have revealed its present landscape, very little is known about its geologic past. Now researchers at MIT and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville have analyzed images of Titan's river networks and determined that in some regions, rivers have created surprisingly little erosion. The researchers say there are two possible explanations: either erosion on Titan is extremely slow, or some other recent phenomena may have wiped out older riverbeds and landforms. \"It's a surface that should have eroded much more than what we're seeing, if the river networks have been active for a long time,\" says Taylor Perron, the Cecil and Ida Green Assistant Professor of Geology at MIT. \"It raises some very interesting questions about what has been happening on Titan in the last billion years.\" What accounts for a low crater count? Compared to most moons in our solar system, Titan is relatively smooth, with few craters pockmarking its facade. Titan is around four billion years old, about the same age as the rest of the solar system. But judging by the number of craters, one might estimate that its surface is much younger, between 100 million and one billion years old. What might explain this moon's low crater count? Perron says the answer may be similar to what happens on Earth. \"We don't have many impact craters on Earth,\" Perron says. \"People flock to them because they're so few, and one explanation is that Earth's continents are always eroding or being covered with sediment. That may be the case on Titan, too.\" For example, plate tectonics, erupting volcanoes, advancing glaciers and river networks have all reshaped Earth's surface over billions of years. On Titan, similar processes - tectonic upheaval, icy lava eruptions, erosion and sedimentation by rivers - may be at work. But identifying which of these geological phenomena may have modified Titan's surface is a significant challenge. Images generated by the Cassini spacecraft, similar to aerial photos but with much coarser resolution, are flat, depicting terrain from a bird's-eye perspective, with no information about a landform's elevation or depth. \"It's an interesting challenge,\" Perron says. \"It's almost like we were thrown back a few centuries, before there were many topographic maps, and we only had maps showing where the rivers are.\" Charting a river's evolution. Perron and MIT graduate student Benjamin Black set out to determine the extent to which river networks may have renewed Titan's surface. The team analyzed images taken from Cassini-Huygens, and mapped 52 prominent river networks from four regions on Titan. The researchers compared the images with a model of river network evolution developed by Perron. This model depicts the evolution of a river over time, given variables such as the strength of the underlying material and the rate of flow through the river channels. As a river erodes slowly through the ice, it transforms from a long, spindly thread into a dense, treelike network of tributaries. Black compared his measurements of Titan's river networks with the model, and found the moon's rivers most resembled the early stages of a typical terrestrial river's evolution. The observations indicate that rivers in some regions have caused very little erosion, and hence very little modification of Titan's surface. \"They're more on the long and spindly side,\" Black says. \"You do see some full and branching networks, and that's tantalizing, because if we get more data, it will be interesting to know whether there really are regional differences.\" Going a step further, Black compared Titan's images with recently renewed landscapes on Earth, including volcanic terrain on the island of Kauai and recently glaciated landscapes in North America. The river networks in those locations are similar in form to those on Titan, suggesting that geologic processes may have reshaped the moon's icy surface in the recent past. Oded Aharonson, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology, says analyzing geologic processes on Titan may help scientists understand how rivers form. \"Besides Earth, Titan is the only world where we see active river networks forming as a result of an active hydrologic cycle,\" Aharonson says. \"The finding suggests the process of river erosion on Titan is currently responding to resurfacing or resetting of the surface.\" \"It's a weirdly Earth-like place, even with this exotic combination of materials and temperatures,\" Perron says. \"And so you can still say something definitive about the erosion. It's the same physics.\" This research was supported by NASA's Cassini Data Analysis Program.

It is one of the small northern lakes on Titan and Cassini mission scientists hoped to use the spacecraft's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer to glean new details about the lake by analyzing its reflected light. In addition to studying Kivu Lacus, Cassini was expected to use the VIMS instrument to observe a huge lake called Punga Mare, the third largest body of liquid on Titan.

The image below is an artist's impression, showing seasonal change in Titan's atmosphere during and after Titan's 2009 equinox. An equinox for Earth or any planet or moon occurs when the sun appears over that world's equator at local noon. It's a seasonal marker, in this case a time when both hemispheres of a world are receiving more or less equal heating from the sun. Scientists say the change in seasons on Titan before and after this equinox involved a wholesale reversal, at unexpected altitudes in the circulation of Titan's atmosphere. The Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004. During the first years of its exploration, it was winter in Titan's northern hemisphere. The north pole of Titan was seen to have a \"hood\" of dense gaseous haze, and a high-altitude \"hot spot\". This haze was associated with a vortex above Titan's north pole. And then the season changed. After Titan's 2009 equinox, the moon's north pole began tilting more in the direction towards the sun. Spring was arriving in Titan's northern hemisphere. Meanwhile, the moon's southern hemisphere was tilting away from the sun and moving into autumn. After Titan's equinox and until 2011, there was still a significant build up of trace gases over the north pole, even though the north pole vortex, and the observed hot spot, had almost disappeared. Meanwhile, similar features began developing at the south pole, for example, a south pole vortex, which are still present today. In a press release, Cassini scientists said these changes indicate: ... a large-scale reversal in the single pole-to-pole atmospheric circulation cell of Titan immediately after equinox, with an upwelling of gases in the > summer hemisphere and a corresponding downwelling in the winter hemisphere. Mike Flasar at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland added: Next, we would expect to see the vortex over the south pole build up. As that happens, one question is whether the south winter pole will be the identical twin of the north winter pole, or will it have a distinct personality? The most important thing is to be able to keep watching as these changes happen. And watch they will, as long as the wonderful Cassini spacecraft continues sending back its data. Bottom line: Who would have imagined a few decades ago that we'd be able to watch the seasons change on Saturn's large moon Titan. And yet the Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting in and around the Saturnian system since 2004, lets us do just that. Scientists have seen what they're calling a wholesale reversal in the atmosphere of Titan, from 2004 to now.

Scientists with NASA's Cassini mission have spotted what appears to be a miniature, extraterrestrial likeness of Earth's Nile River: a river valley on Saturn's moon Titan that stretches more than 200 miles from its \"headwaters\" to a large sea. It is the first time images have revealed a river system this vast and in such high resolution anywhere other than Earth. Scientists deduce that the river, which is in Titan's north polar region, is filled with liquid hydrocarbons because it appears dark along its entire length in the high-resolution radar image, indicating a smooth surface. \"Though there are some short, local meanders, the relative straightness of the river valley suggests it follows the trace of at least one fault, similar to other large rivers running into the southern margin of this same Titan sea,\" said Jani Radebaugh, a Cassini radar team associate at Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. \"Such faults - fractures in Titan's bedrock -- may not imply plate tectonics, like on Earth, but still lead to the opening of basins and perhaps to the formation of the giant seas themselves.\" Titan is the only other world we know of that has stable liquid on its surface. While Earth's hydrologic cycle relies on water, Titan's equivalent cycle involves hydrocarbons such as ethane and methane. In Titan's equatorial regions, images from Cassini's visible-light cameras in late 2010 revealed regions that darkened due to recent rainfall. Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer confirmed liquid ethane at a lake in Titan's southern hemisphere known as Ontario Lacus in 2008. \"Titan is the only place we've found besides Earth that has a liquid in continuous movement on its surface,\" said Steve Wall, the radar deputy team lead, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"This picture gives us a snapshot of a world in motion. Rain falls, and rivers move that rain to lakes and seas, where evaporation starts the cycle all over again. On Earth, the liquid is water; on Titan, it's methane; but on both it affects most everything that happens.\" The radar image here was taken on Sept. 26, 2012. It shows Titan's north polar region, where the river valley flows into the sea called Ligeia Mare. The real Nile River stretches about 4,100 miles.

The European Space Agency's unmanned Huygens probe dropped onto the surface of Titan on Jan. 14, 2005, three weeks after separating from its parent Cassini spacecraft. The new animation, which was created by ESA using real Huygens data, captures the last portion of the lander's 2 1/2-hour descent through Titan's thick, nitrogen-based atmosphere. The new Huygens landing video, which runs for 1 minute and 40 seconds, shows the touchdown from a variety of angles and ends with a real photo Huygens took of Titan's surface. Though Huygens stopped sending data home to Earth 90 minutes after touching down, the landing continues to teach researchers about Titan. An analysis of Huygens data published late last year, for example, determined that the 400-pound probe bounced, slid and wobbled to a stop 10 seconds after first contacting the moon. The study suggests that Titan's surface at the time had the consistency of soft, wet sand with a fragile crust on top, researchers said. Titan is the largest moon of Saturn, and the second-largest moon in the entire solar system. With a diameter of 3,200 miles, Titan is nearly 50 percent wider than Earth's moon. Titan is the only object in the solar system besides Earth known to host stable bodies of liquid on its surface. But Titan's lakes and seas contain methane and ethane rather than water, as the huge moon has a weather cycle based on hydrocarbons.

In a new paper that provides the most detail yet about the life and death of a monstrous thunder-and-lightning storm on Saturn, scientists from NASA's Cassini mission describe how the massive storm churned around the planet until it encountered its own tail and sputtered out. It is the first time scientists have observed a storm consume itself in this way anywhere in the solar system. \"This Saturn storm behaved like a terrestrial hurricane - but with a twist unique to Saturn,\" said Andrew Ingersoll, a Cassini imaging team member based at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, who is a co-author on the new paper in the journal Icarus. \"Even the giant storms at Jupiter don't consume themselves like this, which goes to show that nature can play many awe-inspiring variations on a theme and surprise us again and again.\" Earth's hurricanes feed off the energy of warm water and leave a cold-water wake. This storm in Saturn's northern hemisphere also feasted off warm \"air\" in the gas giant's atmosphere. The storm, first detected on December 5th, 2010, and tracked by Cassini's radio and plasma wave subsystem and imaging cameras, erupted around 33 degrees north latitude. Shortly after the bright, turbulent head of the storm emerged and started moving west, it spawned a clockwise-spinning vortex that drifted much more slowly. Within months, the storm wrapped around the planet at that latitude, stretching about 190,000 miles in circumference, thundering and throwing lightning along the way. Terrestrial storms have never run into their own wakes - they encounter topographic features like mountains first and expend themselves. But Saturn has no land to stop its hurricanes. The bright, turbulent storm head was able to chomp all the way around the planet. It was only when the head of the storm ran into the vortex in June 2011 that the massive, convective storm faded away. Why the encounter would shut down the storm is still a mystery. By August 28th, after 267 days, the Saturn storm stopped thundering for good. While Cassini's infrared detectors continue to track some lingering effects in higher layers of Saturn's atmosphere, the troposphere - which is the weather- producing layer, lower in the atmosphere - has been quiet at that latitude. \"This thunder-and-lightning storm on Saturn was a beast,\" said Kunio Sayanagi, the paper's lead author and a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University in Virginia. \"The storm maintained its intensity for an unusually long time. The storm head itself thrashed for 201 days, and its updraft erupted with an intensity that would have sucked out the entire volume of Earth's atmosphere in 150 days. And it also created the largest vortex ever observed in the troposphere of Saturn, expanding up to 7,500 miles 12,000 kilometers across.\" The vortex grew to be as large as the giant storm known as Oval BA on Jupiter. But Oval BA and Jupiter's more famous storm - the Great Red Spot - are not thunder-and-lightning storms. Jupiter's storms also have a quiet center, unlike the violence at the center of Saturn's storms. \"Cassini's stay in the Saturn system has enabled us to marvel at the power of this storm,\" said Scott Edgington, Cassini's deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA. \"We had front-row seats to a wonderful adventure movie and got to watch the whole plot from start to finish. These kinds of data help scientists compare weather patterns around our solar system and learn what sustains and extinguishes them.\" This storm was the longest running of the massive storms that appear to break out in Saturn's northern hemisphere once every Saturn year. The longest storm of any size ever detected on Saturn actually unfolded over 334 days in 2009 in an area known as \"Storm Alley\" in the southern hemisphere, but it was about 100 times smaller in area than the latest northern storm.

This is similar to the acceleration that takes place around distant supernovas. Since we can't travel out to the far-off stellar explosions right now, the shockwave that forms from the flow of solar wind around Saturn's magnetic field provides a rare laboratory for scientists with the Cassini mission -- a partnership involving NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency -- to observe this phenomenon up-close. The findings, published this week in the journal Nature Physics, confirm that certain kinds of shocks can become considerably more effective electron accelerators than previously thought. Shock waves are commonplace in the universe, for example in the aftermath of a stellar explosion as debris accelerate outward in a supernova remnant, or when the flow of particles from the sun - the solar wind - impinges on the magnetic field of a planet to form a bow shock. Under certain magnetic field orientations and depending on the strength of the shock, particles can be accelerated to close to the speed of light at these boundaries. These may be the dominant source of cosmic rays, high-energy particles that pervade our galaxy. Scientists are particularly interested in \"quasi-parallel\" shocks, where the magnetic field and the \"forward\"-facing direction of the shock are almost aligned, as may be found in supernova remnants.

It can be tough to study distant supernovas and their shockwaves, so Cassini's observations provide a welcome proxy, scientists said. \"Cassini has essentially given us the capability of studying the nature of a supernova shock in situ in our own solar system, bridging the gap to distant high-energy astrophysical phenomena that are usually only studied remotely,\" Adam Masters, of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Sagamihara, Japan, said in a statement.

Because of the vast gulf between the two worlds, the Earth-size Venus appears as a bright white dot, just above and to the right of the picture's center. When it took the photo, Cassini was about 498,000 miles from Saturn and roughly 880 million miles from Venus, researchers said. The probe was looking toward the unlit side of the rings from slightly below the ring plane. Each pixel in the image covers about 28 miles. Cassini captured the other image on Jan. 4, when the probe was approximately 371,000 miles from Saturn and 850 million miles from Venus. Venus appears near the top of the photo, sandwiched between Saturn's bright, curving limb and its G ring. The scale in this view is 20 miles per pixel. The broad, fuzzy streak lower down is Saturn's E ring, which is generated by the icy plume of particles erupting from geysers on the planet's enigmatic moon Enceladus.

In 2006, the spacecraft snapped an amazing view of Earth as it appeared from the ringed planet. That photo, called \"In Saturn's Shadow,\" is one of the most popular Cassini images taken to date, mission team members have said. Though Venus is about the same size as Earth and has a similar rocky composition, conditions on the two planets' surfaces are very different. Astronauts walking around on Venus would experience pressures 100 times greater than those on Earth's surface and temperatures around 870 degrees Fahrenheit - hot enough to melt lead. Both of these extremes are a result of Venus' thick, carbon-dioxide-dominated atmosphere, which has created a runaway greenhouse effect on the second planet from the sun. The $3.2 billion Cassini mission is a joint effort involving NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. Cassini launched in 1997 and arrived at the Saturn system in 2004. It is now studying the ringed planet and its many moons on an extended mission that runs through at least 2017.

Launch occurred at 4:43 a.m. EDT, October 15, 1997 from Launch Complex 40 on Cape Canaveral Air Station. After a 2.2-billion mile journey that will include two swing-bys of Venus and one of Earth to gain additional velocity, the two-storey tall spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in July 2004. The orbiter will circle the planet for four years, its complement of 12 scientific instruments gathering data about Saturn's atmosphere, rings and magnetosphere and conducting closeup observations of the Saturnian moons. Huygens, with a separate suite of six science instruments, will separate from Cassini to fly on a ballistic trajectory toward Titan, the only celestial body besides Earth to have an atmosphere rich in nitrogen. Scientists are eager to study further this chemical similarity in hopes of learning more about the origins of our own planet Earth. Huygens will provide the first direct sampling of Titan's atmospheric chemistry and the first detailed photographs of its surface.

A team led by Christophe Sotin of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., fed these results into a model that suggests the supply of the hydrocarbon methane at Titan could be coming to an end soon. The study of the lakes also led scientists to spot a few new ones in images from Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer data in June 2010. Titan is the only other place in the solar system besides Earth that has stable liquid on its surface. Scientists think methane is at the heart of a cycle at Titan that is somewhat similar to the role of water in Earth's hydrological cycle - causing rain, carving channels and evaporating from lakes. However, the fact that the lakes seem remarkably consistent in size and shape over several years of data from Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer suggests that the lakes evaporate very slowly. Methane tends to evaporate quickly, so scientists think the lakes must be dominated by methane's sister hydrocarbon ethane, which evaporates more slowly. The lakes are also not getting filled quickly, and scientists haven't seen more than the occasional outburst of hydrocarbon rain at the moon over the mission's eight-plus years in the Saturn system. This indicates that on Titan, the methane that is constantly being lost by breaking down to form ethane and other heavier molecules is not being replaced by fresh methane from the interior. The team suggests that the current load of methane at Titan may have come from some kind of gigantic outburst from the interior eons ago possibly after a huge impact. They think Titan's methane could run out in tens of millions of years. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C.

The map was just published as part of a paper in the journal Icarus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon - with a radius of about 1,600 miles, it's bigger than planet Mercury - and is the second-largest moon in the solar system. Scientists care about Titan because it's the only moon in the solar system known to have clouds, surface liquids and a mysterious, thick atmosphere. The cold atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, like Earth's, but the organic compound methane on Titan acts the way water vapor does on Earth, forming clouds and falling as rain and carving the surface with rivers. Organic chemicals, derived from methane, are present in Titan's atmosphere, lakes and rivers and may offer clues about the origins of life. \"Titan has so much interesting activity - like flowing liquids and moving sand dunes - but to understand these processes it's useful to know how the terrain slopes,\" said Ralph Lorenz, a member of the Cassini radar team based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Md., who led the map-design team. \"It's especially helpful to those studying hydrology and modeling Titan's climate and weather, who need to know whether there is high ground or low ground driving their models.\" Titan's thick haze scatters light in ways that make it very hard for remote cameras to \"see\" landscape shapes and shadows, the usual approach to measuring topography on planetary bodies. Virtually all the data we have on Titan comes from NASA's Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft, which has flown past the moon nearly 100 times over the past decade. On many of those flybys, Cassini has used a radar imager, which can peer through the haze, and the radar data can be used to estimate the surface height. \"With this new topographic map, one of the most fascinating and dynamic worlds in our solar system now pops out in 3-D,\" said Steve Wall, the deputy team lead of Cassini's radar team, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"On Earth, rivers, volcanoes and even weather are closely related to heights of surfaces - we're now eager to see what we can learn from them on Titan.\" There are challenges, however. \"Cassini isn't orbiting Titan,\" Lorenz said. \"We have only imaged about half of Titan's surface, and multiple 'looks' or special observations are needed to estimate the surface heights. If you divided Titan into 1-degree by 1-degree latitude and longitude squares, only 11 percent of those squares have topography data in them.\" Lorenz's team used a mathematical process called splining - effectively using smooth, curved surfaces to \"join\" the areas between grids of existing data. \"You can take a spot where there is no data, look how close it is to the nearest data, and use various approaches of averaging and estimating to calculate your best guess,\" he said. \"If you pick a point, and all the nearby points are high altitude, you'd need a special reason for thinking that point would be lower. We're mathematically papering over the gaps in our coverage.\" The estimations fit with current knowledge of the moon - that its polar regions are \"lower\" than areas around the equator, for example - but connecting those points allows scientists to add new layers to their studies of Titan's surface, especially those modeling how and where Titan's rivers flow, and the seasonal distribution of its methane rainfall. \"The movement of sands and the flow of liquids are influenced by slopes, and mountains can trigger cloud formation and therefore rainfall. This global product now gives modelers a convenient description of this key factor in Titan's dynamic climate system,\" Lorenz said. The most recent data used to compile the map is from 2012; Lorenz says it could be worth revising when the Cassini mission ends in 2017, when more data will have accumulated, filling some of the gaps in present coverage. \"We felt we couldn't wait and should release an interim product,\" he says. \"The community has been hoping to get this for a while. I think it will stimulate a lot of interesting work.\" The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and ASI, the Italian Space Agency.

But the upcoming photo op will be the first time Earth's citizens have warning that their photo will be taken and can prepare accordingly, scientists say. \"My sincere wish is that people the world over stop what they're doing at the time the Earth picture is taken to revel in the sheer wonder of simply being alive on a pale blue dot of a planet, and to appreciate the ever-widening perspective of ourselves and our world that we have gained from our interplanetary explorations,\" Cassini imaging team leader Carolyn Porco of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo., said in a statement.

The first full-view photo of Earth from space was taken by the crew of the Apollo 17 mission as they traveled toward the moon on December 7, 1972. That photo, dubbed \" The Blue Marble ,\" was an instant classic. Another famous Earth portrait was the \" Pale Blue Dot \" shot captured by NASA's Voyager 1 probe in 1990 from a record distance of 3.7 billion miles away, beyond the orbit of Neptune. Cassini itself has already taken two photos of Earth from a distance, with its first, snapped in 2006, becoming one of the probe's most famous images ever. \"Ever since we caught sight of the Earth among the rings of Saturn in September 2006 in a mosaic that has become one of Cassini's most beloved images, I have wanted to do it all over again, only better,\" Porco said. \"And this time, I wanted to turn the entire event into an opportunity for everyone around the globe, at the same time, to savor the uniqueness of our beautiful blue-ocean planet and the preciousness of the life on it.\" Cassini launched in 1997 and arrived in orbit around Saturn in July 2004.

This is the first hexagon movie of its kind, using color filters, and the first to show a complete view of the top of Saturn down to about 70 degrees latitude. Spanning about 20,000 miles across, the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200-mile-per-hour winds with a massive, rotating storm at the center. There is no weather feature exactly, consistently like this anywhere else in the solar system. \"The hexagon is just a current of air, and weather features out there that share similarities to this are notoriously turbulent and unstable,\" said Andrew Ingersoll, a Cassini imaging team member at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"A hurricane on Earth typically lasts a week, but this has been here for decades -- and who knows -- maybe centuries.\" Weather patterns on Earth are interrupted when they encounter friction from landforms or ice caps. Scientists suspect the stability of the hexagon has something to do with the lack of solid landforms on Saturn, which is essentially a giant ball of gas. Better views of the hexagon are available now because the sun began to illuminate its interior in late 2012. Cassini captured images of the hexagon over a 10-hour time span with high-resolution cameras, giving scientists a good look at the motion of cloud structures within. They saw the storm around the pole, as well as small vortices rotating in the opposite direction of the hexagon. Some of the vortices are swept along with the jet stream as if on a racetrack. The largest of these vortices spans about 2,200 miles, or about twice the size of the largest hurricane recorded on Earth. Scientists analyzed these images in false color, a rendering method that makes it easier to distinguish differences among the types of particles suspended in the atmosphere -- relatively small particles that make up haze -- inside and outside the hexagon. \"Inside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true,\" said Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University in Virginia. \"The hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth's Antarctic ozone hole.\" The Antarctic ozone hole forms within a region enclosed by a jet stream with similarities to the hexagon. Wintertime conditions enable ozone-destroying chemical processes to occur, and the jet stream prevents a resupply of ozone from the outside. At Saturn, large aerosols cannot cross into the hexagonal jet stream from outside, and large aerosol particles are created when sunlight shines on the atmosphere. Only recently, with the start of Saturn's northern spring in August 2009, did sunlight begin bathing the planet's northern hemisphere. \"As we approach Saturn's summer solstice in 2017, lighting conditions over its north pole will improve, and we are excited to track the changes that occur both inside and outside the hexagon boundary,\" said Scott Edgington, Cassini deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. A black-and-white version of the imaging camera movie and movies obtained by Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer are also tools Cassini scientists can use to look at wind speeds and the mini-storms inside the jet stream.

Murray is the lead author of the paper published this week in the journal Icarus describing the event. Images captured by the Cassini spacecraft almost exactly a year ago show an unusually bright arc and some bumps at the edge of Saturn's outermost ring, which is normally smooth. Murray and his team think it may be caused by the gravity of a newborn moon, too small to see. \"We may be looking at the act of birth, where this object is just leaving the rings and heading off to be a moon in its own right.\" The researchers have nicknamed the possible baby moon \"Peggy\" and suggest it is probably less than a kilometre in diameter. Cassini is expected to move closer to Saturn's outermost ring in late 2016, which may allow it to study Peggy in more detail or capture an actual image, a NASA news release said. Saturn has 62 confirmed moons. The biggest and most famous is Titan, where large quantities of methane and other carbon-based molecules have been detected. According to Murray, scientists think Saturn's rings were once much bigger, and that moons formed from the ring material over time, depleting them. \"It is possible the process of moon formation in Saturn's rings has ended with Peggy,\" NASA added in its release, \"as Saturn's rings now are, in all likelihood, too depleted to make more moons.\" Cassini launched in 1997 with the European Space Agency's Huygens probe, with a mission to study Saturn, its rings and its moons.

On June 11, 2004, Cassini passed Phoebe, the largest of Saturn's outer or \"irregular\" moons, at an altitude of just 1,285 miles. This was the sole close flyby of one of the outer moons of Saturn in the entire Cassini mission. This montage of two views is published by the Cassini team to mark the 10th anniversary of the Phoebe flyby. The image on the left side shows Cassini's view on approach to Phoebe, while the right side shows the spacecraft's departing perspective. Most of the left- side view was previously released as PIA06073 ; an area on its upper right side is newly filled in here. Most of the view on the right side has not previously been released, although the crater at upper left is seen in PIA06074. Phoebe's shape is approximately spherical and PIA15507 for more details, with a diameter of 136 miles on its longest axis and 127 miles on its shortest axis, which is also the rotation axis. This is approximately 16 times smaller than Earth's moon. For several reasons, Phoebe is thought to be a captured object that does not share a joint origin with Saturn and the inner, \"regular\" satellites. It orbits in a retrograde direction, opposite to the direction of Saturn's other major moons. Its overall density was determined by Cassini scientists to be quite large for a moon of Saturn. The prevailing view is that Phoebe might have formed in the Kuiper Belt, far beyond the orbit of Saturn. It might thus be a small cousin of the largest Kuiper Belt object, Pluto. The image mosaic on the left, recorded about 45 minutes before closest approach to Phoebe, is composed of six frames from Cassini's Narrow-Angle Camera, plus one Wide-Angle Camera image to fill the gap on the upper-right limb. The image has a spatial resolution of 260 feet per pixel. The sun-Phoebe-spacecraft, or phase, angle is 80 degrees. The image at right, taken about half an hour after closest approach, is composed of eight NAC frames. The spatial resolution is 210 feet per pixel, and the phase angle is 83 degrees. The images have been slightly rescaled from their original formats and sharpened. Because Phoebe is a very dark object, contrast enhancement was also necessary. At such high phase angles, the brightest parts of the surface, except where bright ice is exposed, reflect only about four percent of the incoming sunlight. The mosaics are composed of monochromatic, or single-color, images.

The Cassini spacecraft, carrying the European Space Agency's Huygens probe, arrived in the Saturn system on June 30, 2004, for a four-year primary mission. Since 2008, NASA has granted the mission three extensions, allowing scientists an unprecedented opportunity to observe seasonal changes as the planet and its retinue completed one-third of their nearly 30-year-long trek around the sun. \"Having a healthy, long-lived spacecraft at Saturn has afforded us a precious opportunity,\" said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"By having a decade there with Cassini, we have been privileged to witness never-before-seen events that are changing our understanding of how planetary systems form and what conditions might lead to habitats for life.\" After 10 years at Saturn, the stalwart spacecraft has beamed back to Earth hundreds of gigabytes of scientific data, enabling the publication of more than 3,000 scientific reports. Representing just a sampling, 10 of Cassini's top accomplishments and discoveries are: -- The Huygens probe makes first landing on a moon in the outer solar system -- Discovery of active, icy plumes on the Saturnian moon Enceladus -- Saturn's rings revealed as active and dynamic -- a laboratory for how planets form -- Titan revealed as an Earth-like world with rain, rivers, lakes and seas -- Studies of Saturn's great northern storm of 2010-2011 -- Studies reveal radio-wave patterns are not tied to Saturn's interior rotation, as previously thought -- Vertical structures in the rings imaged for the first time -- Study of prebiotic chemistry on Titan -- Mystery of the dual, bright-dark surface of the moon Iapetus solved -- First complete view of the north polar hexagon and discovery of giant hurricanes at both of Saturn's poles \"It's incredibly difficult to sum up 10 extraordinary years of discovery in a short list, but it's an interesting exercise to think about what the mission will be best remembered for many years in the future,\" Spilker said. In celebration of the 10th anniversary, members of the Cassini team selected some of their favorite images for a gallery, describing in their own words what makes the images special to them. While Cassini was originally approved for a four-year study of the Saturn system, the project's engineers and scientists had high hopes that the mission might carry on longer, and designed the system for endurance. The spacecraft has been remarkably trouble-free, and from an engineering standpoint, the main limiting factor for Cassini's lifetime now is how much propellant is left in its tanks. The mission owes a great deal of its longevity to skillful and efficient piloting by the mission's navigation and operations teams. \"Our team has done a fantastic job optimizing trajectories to save propellant, and we've learned to operate the spacecraft to get the most out of it that we possibly can,\" said Earl Maize, Cassini project manager at JPL. \"We're proud to celebrate a decade of exploring Saturn, and we look forward to many discoveries still to come.\" ", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cassini-celebrates-10-years-exploring-saturn"}, {"title": "Happy anniversary, Cassini spacecraft", "date": "2014-06-30", "content": "In the past 10 years, no spacecraft has consistently delivered the wonder of our solar system like the flagship-class NASA-ESA robotic spacecraft Cassini.

The new results come from a study of gravity and topography data collected during Cassini's repeated flybys of Titan during the past 10 years. Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell. The findings are published in this week's edition of the journal Icarus. \"Titan continues to prove itself as an endlessly fascinating world, and with our long-lived Cassini spacecraft, we're unlocking new mysteries as fast as we solve old ones,\" said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who was not involved in the study. Additional findings support previous indications the moon's icy shell is rigid and in the process of freezing solid. Researchers found that a relatively high density was required for Titan's ocean in order to explain the gravity data. This indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth. \"This is an extremely salty ocean by Earth standards,\" said the paper's lead author, Giuseppe Mitri of the University of Nantes in France. \"Knowing this may change the way we view this ocean as a possible abode for present-day life, but conditions might have been very different there in the past.\" Cassini data also indicate the thickness of Titan's ice crust varies slightly from place to place. The researchers said this can best be explained if the moon's outer shell is stiff, as would be the case if the ocean were slowly crystalizing and turning to ice. Otherwise, the moon's shape would tend to even itself out over time, like warm candle wax. This freezing process would have important implications for the habitability of Titan's ocean, as it would limit the ability of materials to exchange between the surface and the ocean. A further consequence of a rigid ice shell, according to the study, is any outgassing of methane into Titan's atmosphere must happen at scattered \"hot spots\" -- like the hot spot on Earth that gave rise to the Hawaiian Island chain. Titan's methane does not appear to result from convection or plate tectonics recycling its ice shell. How methane gets into the moon's atmosphere has long been of great interest to researchers, as molecules of this gas are broken apart by sunlight on short geological timescales. Titan's present atmosphere contains about five percent methane. This means some process, thought to be geological in nature, must be replenishing the gas. The study indicates that whatever process is responsible, the restoration of Titan's methane is localized and intermittent. \"Our work suggests looking for signs of methane outgassing will be difficult with Cassini, and may require a future mission that can find localized methane sources,\" said Jonathan Lunine, a scientist on the Cassini mission at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, and one of the paper's co-authors. \"As on Mars, this is a challenging task.\"", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/ocean-on-saturn-moon-could-be-as-salty-as-the-dead-sea"}, {"title": "TPR Presents: Saturn, Up Close and Personal", "date": "2014-08-22", "content": "In 1997, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft was launched on a mission to study Saturn and its moons.

Transcript: We embark on a journey that will bring us a billion times closer to Titan's surface. Titan is Saturn's largest moon. Right in front of Saturn's disk in this image taken by the Cassini spacecraft. Saturn's atmosphere shows a banded structure and a number of storms. We view the edge of Saturn's gigantic ring system. The rings cast major shadows onto Saturn's southern hemisphere. Titan is surrounded by a partially transparent brown haze. Features on Titan's surface appear. The dark regions on Titan's equator are mostly dune fields. The brighter regions are highlands a few hundred meters high. Images taken from the Huygens probe show Titan's surface in more detail. The probe had spectrometers that measured small variations in the color of Titan's surface that are exaggerated here. Most of Titan's surface is brown. North of the landing site, a pair of parallel dark dunes stretch east-west along the image. A large highland of triangular shape lies to the northwest. More and more dark canyons appear in this area. A complicated network of channels where rivers of methane flowed at some time in the past. To the east of the landing site is a system of bright ridges standing out above the dark, dry lakebed. The ridges have intricate structures that tell stories about their past. The Huygens probe descended toward one of these ridges. As we approach the surface further, we can see this ridge in finer detail. Some regions were imaged with high resolution just before Huygens landed on Titan, especially the area to the west of the landing site. Most of Titan's surface is covered by dark organics that are produced in the atmosphere and slowly settle down. The bright spots may be exposed patches of water ice. The white dot in the center of the image is the landed Huygens probe. While the probe rotated during the descent, its orientation after landing had the camera looking to the south. The camera saw a field of pebbles that were carried around by a river of methane in the past. Some pebbles are larger than a human hand. The Descent Imager Spectral Radiometer is the dark green instrument at the south side of the Huygens probe. Its lamp illuminated the surface, allowing spectral analysis. The lamp's spotlight stands out brightly, since days on Titan are even darker than cloudy days on Earth. Little sunlight reaches Titan's surface due to its thick haze and large distance from the Sun.

The European Space Agency's Huygens probe touched down on the surface of Saturn's huge moon Titan on Jan. 14, 2005, three weeks after being deployed from its mothership, NASA's Cassini spacecraft. For the first time ever, an emissary from Earth had landed softly on a world in the outer solar system. \"I distinctly recall the dreamy feeling of being in one universe one moment and in another universe the next,\" Cassini imaging team leader Carolyn Porco wrote of Huygens' landing in a blog post today. \"But it was no dream. We had, without doubt, journeyed to Titan, 10 times farther from the sun than the Earth, and touched it. The solar system suddenly seemed a very much smaller place.\" Cassini reached the Saturn system in July 2004 and thus had already observed Titan by the time Huygens touched down. But the lander beamed home information impossible to obtain from afar, a data haul that began during Huygens' two-and-a-half-hour descent through the moon's thick atmosphere. \"The images taken by the falling probe and released to the public that night were everything our images from orbit were not: unfiltered, exquisitely detailed views of the moon's surface and unambiguous in their account,\" Porco wrote. Those images revealed what appeared to be a shoreline, as well as snaking channels that had obviously been carved by flowing liquid, she added. But that liquid was not water; Titan has a hydrocarbon-based weather system. The European Space Agency's Huygens lander returned this image from the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on Jan. 14, 2005. \"It was circumstantial but incontrovertible evidence for the liquid hydrocarbons that we had strained from orbit to find, and thrilling beyond measure,\" Porco wrote. \"It was soon to be followed, after landing, by another unforgettable sight, under a cloudy sky and across a cobble-strewn ground to the moon's horizon in the distance.\" Huygens kept sending data to Earth from Titan's freezing surface for 72 minutes before its batteries died and the probe went dark. The lander's measurements and observations helped lift the veil of mystery that had enshrouded Titan. For example, Huygens took a detailed profile of Titan's nitrogen-dominated atmosphere, gathering temperature, pressure and density readings over a wide range of altitudes. Furthermore, Huygens' analyses of Titan's atmospheric methane did not support the suggestion that the gas was produced by microbes, ESA officials said. While Huygens ceased operations shortly after touching down on Titan, Cassini has continued to study the huge moon. For example, over the course of more than 100 flybys, Cassini has mapped much of Titan's surface and, using radar, probed the depth of some of the moon's biggest hydrocarbon seas. Moreover, gravity measurements by Cassini suggest that Titan harbors a subsurface ocean of liquid water, NASA officials said. The $3.2 billion Cassini-Huygens mission - a joint effort of NASA, ESA and the Italian Space Agency - launched in 1997. The Cassini spacecraft is scheduled to keep making observations through September 2017, when the orbiter will end its life with an intentional death dive into the ringed planet's thick atmosphere.

The observations suggest that unmagnetised bodies like Titan might interact with the solar wind in the same basic ways, regardless of their nature or distance from the Sun. Titan is large enough that it could be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun on its own, and a flyby of the giant moon in December 2013 simulated that scenario, from Cassini's vantage point. The encounter was unique within Cassini's mission, as it was the only time the spacecraft has observed Titan in a pristine state, outside the region of space dominated by Saturn's magnetic field, called its magnetosphere. \"We observed that Titan interacts with the solar wind very much like Mars, if you moved it to the distance of Saturn,\" said Cesar Bertucci of the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, who led the research with colleagues from the Cassini mission. \"We thought Titan in this state would look different. We certainly were surprised,\" he said. The solar wind is a fast-flowing gale of charged particles that continually streams outward from the Sun, flowing around the planets like islands in a river. Studying the effects of the solar wind at other planets helps scientists understand how the Sun's activity affects their atmospheres. These effects can include modification of an atmosphere's chemistry as well as its gradual loss to space. Titan spends about 95 percent of the time within Saturn's magnetosphere. But during a Cassini flyby on 1st December 2013, the giant moon happened to be on the sunward side of Saturn when a powerful outburst of solar activity reached the planet. The strong surge in the solar wind so compressed the Sun-facing side of Saturn's magnetosphere that the bubble's outer edge was pushed inside the orbit of Titan. This left the moon exposed to, and unprotected from, the raging stream of energetic solar particles. Using its magnetometer instrument, which is akin to an exquisitely sensitive compass, Cassini has observed Titan many times during the mission's decade in the Saturn system, but always within Saturn's magnetosphere. The spacecraft has not been able to detect a magnetic field coming from Titan itself. In its usual state, Titan is cloaked in Saturn's magnetic field. This time the influence of Saturn was not present, allowing Cassini's magnetometer to observe Titan as it interacted directly with the solar wind. The special circumstance allowed Bertucci and colleagues to study the shockwave that formed around Titan where the full-force solar wind rammed into the moon's atmosphere. At Earth, our planet's powerful magnetic field acts as a shield against the solar wind, helping to protect our atmosphere from being stripped away. In the case of Venus, Mars and comets - none of which is protected by a global magnetic field - the solar wind drapes around the objects themselves, interacting directly with their atmospheres. Cassini saw the same thing at Titan. Researchers thought they would have to treat Titan's response to the solar wind with a unique approach because the chemistry of the hazy moon's dense atmosphere is highly complex. But Cassini's observations of a naked Titan hinted at a more elegant solution. \"This could mean we can use the same tools to study how vastly different worlds, in different parts of the Solar System, interact with the wind from the Sun,\" Bertucci said. Bertucci noted that the list of similarly unmagnetised bodies might include the dwarf planet Pluto, to be visited this year for the first time by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft. \"After nearly a decade in orbit, the Cassini mission has revealed once again that the Saturn system is full of surprises,\" said Michele Dougherty, principal investigator of the Cassini magnetometer at Imperial College, London. \"After more than a hundred flybys, we have finally encountered Titan out in the solar wind, which will allow us to better understand how such moons maintain or lose their atmospheres.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2015/01/30/cassini-catches-titan-naked-in-the-solar-wind/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Retro moon: Cassini spacecraft studies moon that orbits Saturn backward", "date": "2015-08-17", "content": "When we think of the moons of Saturn, many worlds spring to mind: cloud-shrouded Titan, water-spewing Enceladus, and Death Star-like Mimas merely form the head of the line. But, while impressive, these satellites and others like them form a relatively small fraction of all Saturnian moons. Wandering much farther from Saturn is a group whose population comprises nearly half of the planet's more than 60 satellites, and this week NASA's Cassini spacecraft took time to study one of these distant objects. Twenty-nine moons make up the so-called Norse group of satellites around Saturn. Only large Phoebe has been studied in detail, but this week's target, Hyrrokkin, is much smaller- only around 8 km in size-and farther away. That means that even in Cassini's high-powered Narrow-Angle Camera, Hyrrokkin appears as nothing more than a point of light. What can we learn from that point of light? For one, it will help scientists pin down the moon's orbital trajectory. Hyrrokkin's orbit has high eccentricity, meaning it moves dramatically closer and farther from Saturn as it circles the planet. But what sets the Norse group apart is the direction they orbit: retrograde, astronomy jargon for backwards. This means that these objects probably did not form with Saturn. Instead, over the last few billion years, they were probably captured when straying too close to the planet. By monitoring how the apparent brightness of Hyrrokkin changes over time, astronomers will also be able to deduce better constraints on the shape and rotational characteristics of the moon.", "url": "https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/0817/Retro-moon-Cassini-spacecraft-studies-moon-that-orbits-Saturn-backward"}, {"title": "One of Saturn's rings is different", "date": "2015-09-09", "content": "A new study, published in the journal Icarus in July 2015, suggests that one of Saturn's rings is much younger than the rest. When the sun set on Saturn's rings back in August 2009, scientists on NASA's Cassini mission were watching closely. It was the equinox - one of two times in the Saturnian year when the sun illuminates the planet's enormous ring system edge-on. The event provided an extraordinary opportunity for the orbiting Cassini spacecraft to observe short-lived changes in the rings that reveal details about their nature. Like Earth, Saturn is tilted on its axis. Over the course of its 29-year-long orbit, the sun's rays move from north to south over the planet and its rings, and back again. The changing sunlight causes the temperature of the rings - which are made of trillions of icy particles - to vary from season to season. During equinox, which lasted only a few days, unusual shadows and wavy structures appeared and, as they sat in twilight for this brief period, the rings began to cool. In a study published in the journal Icarus in July 2015, a team of Cassini scientists reported that one section of the rings appears to have been running a slight fever during equinox. The higher-than-expected temperature provided a unique window into the interior structure of ring particles not usually available to scientists. Ryuji Morishima of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, led the study. Morishima said: For the most part, we can't learn much about what Saturn's ring particles are like deeper than 1 millimeter below the surface. But the fact that one part of the rings didn't cool as expected allowed us to model what they might be like on the inside. The researchers examined data collected by Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer during the year around equinox. The instrument essentially took the rings' temperature as they cooled. The scientists then compared the temperature data with computer models that attempt to describe the properties of ring particles on an individual scale. What they found was puzzling. For most of the giant expanse of Saturn's rings, the models correctly predicted how the rings cooled as they fell into darkness. But one large section - the outermost of the large, main rings, called the A ring - was much warmer than the models predicted. The temperature spike was especially prominent in the middle of the A ring. To address this curiosity, Morishima and colleagues performed a detailed investigation of how ring particles with different structures would warm up and cool down during Saturn's seasons. Previous studies based on Cassini data have shown Saturn's icy ring particles are fluffy on the outside, like fresh snow. This outer material, called regolith , is created over time, as tiny impacts pulverize the surface of each particle. The team's analysis suggested the best explanation for the A ring's equinox temperatures was for the ring to be composed largely of particles roughly 3 feet wide made of mostly solid ice, with only a thin coating of regolith. Morishima said: > A high concentration of dense, solid ice chunks in this one region of > Saturn's rings is unexpected,\" said Morishima. \"Ring particles usually > spread out and become evenly distributed on a timescale of about 100 million > years. The accumulation of dense ring particles in one place suggests that some process either placed the particles there in the recent geologic past or the particles are somehow being confined there. The researchers suggest a couple of possibilities to explain how this aggregation came to be. A moon may have existed at that location within the past hundred million years or so and was destroyed, perhaps by a giant impact. If so, debris from the breakup might not have had time to diffuse evenly throughout the ring. Alternatively, they posit that small, rubble-pile moonlets could be transporting the dense, icy particles as they migrate within the ring. The moonlets could disperse the icy chunks in the middle A ring as they break up there under the gravitational influence of Saturn and its larger moons. Linda Spilker is a Cassini project scientist and a co-author of the study. She said: This particular result is fascinating because it suggests that the middle of Saturn's A ring may be much younger than the rest of the rings. Other parts > of the rings may be as old as Saturn itself.

The pictures show the area to be filled with thin cracks that slice through a variety of craters. Researchers have known since 2005 that icy plumes erupt from underneath the surface of Enceladus, and recently, NASA confirmed that the moon has a vast ocean underneath its icy crust. It's possible that hydrothermal activity is occurring on the seafloor of this ocean, which could give rise to life. Getting close-up views like these will help NASA scientists understand how the geology of Enceladus evolves over time. The features of the moon's surface can provide details about what's going on underneath the crust. This flyby was only the opening act for Cassini, though. The real excitement will occur on October 28th, when the spacecraft will come within 30 miles of the southern pole of Enceladus. Cassini will pass through some of the icy plumes that have been observed on the moon, collecting data about what lies in the ocean underneath. This will tell NASA more about the subsurface ocean's chemistry and whether or not the area could be habitable. Cassini can't determine if life exists underneath the moon, but the probe is designed to tell researchers if Enceladus' water is a place where microbes could thrive.

After Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004, it didn't take long for the spacecraft to reveal that Enceladus boasted surprising geologic activity. Cassini revealed that, far from being a stagnant chunk of ice and rock, the moon contained a series of geysers across its southern pole. The discovery caused changes to the original mission flight plan to maximize flybys of the moon. The final flyby was Cassini's 22nd Enceladus encounter. In addition to studying the characteristics of the geysers, Cassini also revealed that the icy moon contains a global ocean layer and geologic activity beneath its icy crust. These discoveries make Enceladus one of the best potential sites in the solar system where life had the potential to evolve beyond Earth.

The images at left show the same region of Ligeia Mare as seen by Cassini's radar during flybys in 2007, 2013, 2014 and 2015. In the shadow of Saturn's hulking planetary mass, Titan's liquid hydrocarbon seas seem a bit choppy, astronomers say. Two and a half years ago, surfing through Cassini mission radar images of Ligeia Mare, the second-largest sea on Saturn's moon Titan, a team of Cornell astronomers found a bright, mysterious feature - a transient feature they dubbed \"Magic Island.\" Now, after Cassini observations in August 2014 and January 2015, the scientists confirm that Magic Island is, indeed, a transient feature, and the most likely culprit is surface waves, they report in the journal Icarus, Feb. 18. \"It's really exciting, as we've confirmed that Titan's seas are active environments,\" said Jason Hofgartner, Ph.D. '16, a NASA postdoctoral researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the paper's lead author. \"There are stable liquids on the surface of Titan, and processes acting on these liquids are similar to those on Earth. Titan's seas - though composed of liquid methane and ethane - are not stagnant but rather dynamic environments.\" The astronomers conclude these transient features may be floating or suspended solids, or bubbles, but most likely are waves. During the August 2014 Cassini flyby, the Magic Island region of Ligeia Mare once again appeared anomalously bright compared with adjacent regions. Several months later in January 2015, Cassini flew by and detected no transient bright features. The bitterly cold Titan features a thick atmosphere and is pocked with lakes, seas, rivers and islands, chiseled by liquid methane and ethane. It looks similar to Earth but with an orange haze. Composed of liquid methane and ethane, Ligeia Mare is bigger than the Great Lakes' Lake Superior.

Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, will be using that data to learn about the internal structure of the mysterious giant planet. Fortney is one of four new participating scientists NASA has chosen for the last phase of Cassini's highly successful mission to Saturn. He said the data gathered during the spacecraft's final orbits will yield precise maps of the gravity and magnetic fields of the planet, giving scientists new insights into Saturn's interior structure and composition, including the mass of its deep core and the density of its outer layers. \"We'll have a much better understanding of how the planet works,\" Fortney said. He noted that NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter, which will arrive at that planet in July, will also be gathering data on gravitational and magnetic fields, enabling a great opportunity to compare these two giant worlds. Saturn and Jupiter are both gas giants composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with relatively small rocky cores. \"We really don't know what their interiors are like,\" Fortney said. \"What's great is that, in the space of a year, we'll have once-in-a-lifetime data sets for both Jupiter and Saturn.\" Exoplanets In addition to studying the planets in our own solar system, Fortney is interested in the structure and physics of planets orbiting other stars. He was a member of the science team for NASA's Kepler mission during its prime mission, which has discovered over 1,000 confirmed exoplanets and nearly 4,000 new candidates that have yet to be confirmed. Understanding the planets of our own solar system is important for scientists trying to make sense of new observations of distant exoplanets, he said. \"The internal structure of planets touches on how they form and evolve over time. This is an important time for us to understand our own gas giants for comparison to exoplanets,\" Fortney said. \ufeffIce giants As he prepares for the final stages of the Cassini mission, Fortney is also engaged in the initial planning for a possible future mission to Uranus or Neptune, or both. A mission to one of the two \"ice giants\" was among the top priorities identified by the National Research Council's most recent Planetary Science Decadal Survey. While NASA has not committed to flying such a mission, the agency does want to better define what it might look like. Fortney is one of 14 scientists chosen by NASA, including two from the European Space Agency, to serve on the Science Definition Team for an ice giants mission concept study. The team met recently at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which is leading the study, to begin planning a strategy to maximize the scientific payoff from an ice giants mission. Fortney said there is a possibility for missions to go to both planets, although that constrains what can be done at either planet. The only previous mission to visit the ice giants was Voyager 2, which flew by Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989. \"The two planets look very much alike, but they are dramatically different in the amount of energy coming out of their interiors,\" Fortney said. \"Neptune is ten times brighter than Uranus in the thermal radiation coming out of its interior. We don't know why, and we don't know which one is a better example for exoplanets in that size range. It's probably one of the biggest remaining science questions for the outer solar system.\" The launch window under consideration by the ice giants mission study is sometime between 2025 and 2037, and it would take about ten years for the spacecraft to reach Uranus. \"It might get there and start sending back data around 2045, around the time that I'll be retiring,\" Fortney said. \"It's a little bewildering, but at the same time very exciting to be thinking about that.\" ", "url": "https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/nasa-missions.html"}, {"title": "'Jet' disrupts one of Saturn's rings", "date": "2016-06-15", "content": "Although it might look like a bit of smudgy celestial mischief, neither Pandora nor any of Saturn's other moons is to blame for a recent disruption of one of the planet's rings, according to NASA. Considering that the gas giant has 53 moons in orbit, scientists monitoring NASA's Cassini spacecraft were curious. Using a visible light narrow-angle camera in April, the Cassini spacecraft - which has orbited Saturn since 2004 - captured a view of the disruption. It was caused by what's known as a \"jet\" - the interaction of a small object embedded in the ring itself and material in the core of a ring. Though the individual objects embedded in the rings are hard to see, their activities are more visible, which is one of the ways Cassini has opened our eyes to the mysteries of this outer planet. This particular event was photographed 1.4 million miles from Saturn. Our solar system's gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, are made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. They have rings made of ice and rock chunks that are the remains of shattered comets, asteroids and moons. Even though Saturn is known for its seven rings, which orbit at different speeds and span up to 175,000 miles, NASA's Voyager missions in the 1980s discovered that there are thousands of complicated braided rings, ringlets and spokes within the ring system. The billions of particles in this system can range from tiny ice grains to mountain-size particles. Two small moons, Daphnis and Pan, orbit within the Encke and Keeler Gaps in the rings. Their orbits help keep the gaps open and sweep excess materials out of them, like rocks in a stream. Moons like Prometheus act like shepherds and keep the rings in line by constraining them, but others like Pandora are troublemakers that disrupt the rings. The Cassini mission, which ends in September 2017, has been exploring the planet and its moons, rings and powerful magnetosphere. During the planet's autumnal equinox in 2010, the sun shone on the rings, enabling Cassini to collect exciting insights about their composition. The seven rings are named alphabetically, A through G, in the order that they were discovered. In order to enter the planet's orbit, the spacecraft did a delicate dance through the F and G rings. Saturn is about 900 million miles from the sun, which is nearly 10 times as far as our own distance from the star. While a day on Saturn takes only about 10.7 hours, a year lasts the equivalent of 29 on Earth. And this gas giant has a volume that's a hulking 700 times that of our own planet. Saturn's current alignment is in a straight line with the sun and Earth, which affords us a great view of the planet and even some of its moons. Using a telescope, you can see even more moons and Saturn's rings tilted at 26 degrees.

The images were taken during Cassini's close flyby of Titan on July 25 when the spacecraft came as close as 607 miles from the moon. Cassini's radar instrument is able to pierce the thick global haze surrounding Titan, revealing fine details on the distant world's surface. One of the new images shows long linear dunes, thought to be made up of grains derived from hydrocarbons that have settled out of Titan's atmosphere. Earlier surveys by Cassini have shown that dunes of this type circle most of Titan's equator. Researchers can study the dunes to learn about Titan's winds, the sands that the dunes are composed of, and other features of Titan's landscape. \"Dunes are dynamic features. They're deflected by obstacles along the downwind path, often making beautiful, undulating patterns,\" said Jani Radebaugh, a Cassini radar team associate at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Another radar image shows an area that the Cassini radar team has nicknamed \"Xanadu annex\". Cassini's radar has not previously captured images of this area, but earlier measurements by the spacecraft suggested that the terrain might resemble the large region on Titan named Xanadu, which was first imaged in 1994 by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The new image by Cassini shows that the Xanadu annex is made up of the same type of mountainous terrain as Xanadu. \"This 'annex' looks quite similar to Xanadu using our radar, but there seems to be something different about the surface there that masks this similarity when observing at other wavelengths, as with Hubble,\" said Mike Janssen, also a JPL member of the radar team. \"It's an interesting puzzle.\" Both Xanadu and its annex remain somewhat mysterious. While mountainous terrain on most of Titan appears in small isolated patches, Xanadu covers a wide area. Researchers have suggested a number of theories to explain Xanadu's formation. \"These mountainous areas appear to be the oldest terrains on Titan, probably remnants of the icy crust before it was covered by organic sediments from the atmosphere,\" said Rosaly Lopes, a Cassini radar team member at JPL. \"Hiking in these rugged landscapes would likely be similar to hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota.\" The flyby in July was Cassini's 122nd approach of Titan since the spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004. It was also the spacecraft's final imaging pass over the southernmost regions of Titan. \"If Cassini were orbiting Earth instead of Saturn, this would be like getting our last close view of Australia,\" said Stephen Wall, deputy lead of the Cassini radar team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

The mission will culminate with a plunge into the ringed planet, and the spacecraft will eventually burn up inside Saturn's vast atmosphere. Along the way, Cassini will dart between the rings and the planet itself, collecting valuable data that will reveal the age of the rings and the composition of the planet. \"This is a brand-new mission,\" Cassini project scientist Linda Spilker, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said last week at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences in Pasadena, California. \"We're flying in a place that no spacecraft has ever flown before,\" Spilker said. \"When you fly someplace new, you're really bound to make new discoveries.\" Launched in 1997, Cassini arrived at the ringed planet in 2004. Over the past dozen years, it has revealed plumes and a subsurface ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus, examined the methane lakes and seas of the moon Titan, studied the hexagon storm at Saturn's northern pole and probed the structure of the planet's iconic rings. On April 22, 2017, the spacecraft will begin its final flyby of Titan, a Mercury-size moon. Titan's gravity will help curve the spacecraft's orbit and send it plunging through a 1,200-mile gap in the rings on April 26, according to Spilker. The gravitational boost from Titan \"gives us an equivalent of about a third of the amount of fuel on board,\" Spilker said. The Cassini team will spend the next day anticipating the \"all clear\" signal from the spacecraft. Although the gap in the rings is thought to be cleared out and fairly safe, nothing is certain, Spilker told Space.com. \"It's still an unknown place,\" she said. Cassini should capture some incredible new views of the rings as it makes its daring swoop between them. Although the spacecraft will be moving at 74,000 mph, Spilker said it should be able to capture some breathtaking images. She compared the journey to a car trip, noting that a passenger trying to take a picture directly out the side window would only capture blurry images due to the motion of the car. But peering forward at an angle allows the approaching vistas to be photographed clearly. Similarly, Cassini won't photograph the cosmic vistas directly beside it but will rely on carefully calculated angles to capture clear images, Spilker said. Once inside the rings, Spilker said that Cassini will begin a new set of scientific investigations unlike any of its preceding accomplishments. As the probe flies over Saturn, it will measure the planet's gravity, providing the most accurate measurement to date of the gas giant's mass. By comparing that measurement with the combined mass of the planet and rings , scientists will be able to estimate the isolated mass of Saturn's rings. The newly derived mass of the rings will point to their age. An ancient relic from the early solar system would be larger, consisting of giant bodies that have slowly broken down through collision and weathering. A less massive ring system, however, would suggest that the rings are younger and made of material from a single large planet \"embryo\" or comet, Spilker said. In its final 22 orbits of Saturn, Cassini will also study the composition of the rings and take a closer look at the storms on the surface layers of the planet. Eventually, it will be time for its last trip around the planet that has been its home for so long. Losing a close friend On Sept. 11, 2017, Cassini will make its last targeted distant flyby of Titan, adjusting its path for its final journey. On Sept. 15, at 8 a.m. EDT, the spacecraft will plunge into Saturn, the giant planet that has defined its lifetime. The sacrificial plunge will guarantee that the spacecraft doesn't inadvertently crash down on Enceladus or Titan, two bodies thought of as potentially habitable. \"We satisfy planetary protection and, at the same time, gather tremendous data,\" Spilker said. As Cassini dives through the clouds, it will get a glimpse underneath the surface layers to reveal what is beneath. Saturn is a gas giant, so the spacecraft won't crash down on a hard surface. Instead, it will plunge through the cloud layers like a meteor, sending data back to Earth until it burns up in the atmosphere. \"For me, the Cassini grand finale is about so much more than the final plunge,\" Spilker said. Spilker, who worked on the Voyager mission in the 1980s, has been part of the Cassini mission since the beginning. Although Cassini's instruments weren't selected until 1990, she said the idea for the mission hearkened back to Voyager 2's trip past the ringed planet and its satellites. The probe's images of Titan showed a planet cloaked in clouds. \"It was really that flyby of Titan - we couldn't see beneath the haze - that really got the conversation going,\" she said. For Spilker, the 35-year journey has made the mission team feel like a second family. The most important part of that family is Cassini, which Spilker refers to as \"she.\" \"It feels kind of like losing a close friend or family member,\" said Spilker, whose own children and grandchildren were born over the mission's time span. At the same time, she feels like a proud parent who is cheering on a child who's achieved so much. Cassini has accomplished an incredible amount of science since it arrived at Saturn, and promises to accomplish even more in its final days. \"Think of it like the final chapter in one of the most incredible books you've ever read,\" Spilker said.

By spring, just before it begins the grand finale and effectively plunges to its death in the autumn, it will be exploring the F ring, the outermost feature of the main ring system, from a range of less than 5,000 miles - closer than NASA has ever come before. The F ring is of particular interest to NASA, bursting with dynamic yet extremely transient, short-lived filaments and streamers. The A and B rings will also get their due, the former of which should reveal the presence of small, propeller-shaped moonlets. Cassini will need to perform one final engine burn - its 183rd - in December before it's clear to begin the grand finale in April. Once that phase begins, the spacecraft will perform a series of dives in between Saturn and its rings, just 1,000 or miles above the planet's clouds.

At the time, Cassini was about 746,000 miles from Dione and about 1.1 million miles from Tethys. Freshly harvested data from NASA's Cassini mission reveals that Saturn's bulging core and twisting gravitational forces offer clues to the ages of the planet's moons. Astronomers now believe that the ringed planet's moons are younger than previously thought. \"All of these Cassini mission measurements are changing our view of the Saturnian system, as it turns our old theories upside down. It takes one good spacecraft to tell us how wrong we were in the past,\" said Radwan Tajeddine, Cornell research associate in astronomy and a member of the European-based Encelade scientific team that pored over the Cassini data and published a paper in the astronomy journal Icarus. The Encelade team - lead by Val\u00e9ry Lainey of the Paris Observatory - provided two key measurements in the research, \"New Constraints on Saturn's Interior From Cassini Astrometric Data. \" The scientists measured Saturn's Love number for the first time and confirmed Saturnian moons move away from the planet at a faster rate than expected. Using photographic images taken from century-old glass negatives and Cassini spacecraft observations, the group measured the Love number - named for Augustus E.H. Love, a famed British mathematician who studied elasticity - that describes the rigidity of the tidal bulge and the dissipation factor, which controls the speed at which moons move away. While Saturn is mostly a gigantic shroud of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, it contains a rocky core - about 18 times the size of Earth, which responds to tidal forces from all of Saturn's major moons by bulging. The forces of the bulging core, in turn, push the moons slightly away. \"Those two parameters - the Love number and dissipation factor - are difficult to separate,\" Tajeddine said. So the team detected and examined the orbits of four tiny moons associated with the larger moons Tethys and Dione. While these tiny moons do not affect the tidal forces on Saturn, their orbits are disturbed by Saturn's core tidal bulges. \"By monitoring these disturbances, we managed to obtain the first measurement of Saturn's Love number and distinguish it from the planet's dissipation factor,\" Tajeddine said. \"The moons are migrating away much faster than expected.\" Tajeddine explains that if Saturn moons actually formed 4.5 billion years ago, their current distances from the home planet should be greater. Thus, this new research suggests, the moons are younger than 4.5 billion years, favoring a theory that the moons formed from Saturn's rings. The team also found that Saturn moon Rhea is moving away 10 times faster than the other moons, which is the first evidence that a planet's dissipation factor can vary with its distance in relation to the moon. The scientists have no definitive explanation. After 13 years of cruising around Saturn, to explore its rings and moons, NASA will program Cassini's grand finale - a flight through the planet's rings and a dive into its atmosphere - for September 2017. \"What we believe about Saturn's moons history might still change in the coming years with the finale of the Cassini mission,\" said Lainey, who suggested, \"The more we learn about Saturn, the more we learn about exoplanets.\" ", "url": "https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/12/saturn-s-bulging-core-implies-moons-younger-thought"}, {"title": "Saturn's Cassini-Huygens space probe, 1997-2017", "date": "2016-12-06", "content": "The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, developed jointly by the European Space Administration and NASA, was launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in October 1997. Powered by a 33-kg, red-hot plutonium heart, the starship weighed 5.6 tonnes at birth, making it the portliest interplanetary probe ever sent skyward. Its destination: the haunting, many-ringed Saturn. It was named for a pair of 17th-century European astronomers: Giovanni Domenico Cassini, a Tuscan who observed-with a telescope smaller than a modern child's toy refractor-the permanent, gravitationally induced gap in Saturn's rings that is now known as the Cassini Division; and the Dutchman Christiaan Huygens, the discoverer of Saturn's companion Titan, the largest moon in all the solar system. It took six years and eight months for Cassini-Huygens to reach its destination, travelling a serpentine path that used the gravitational pulls of Earth, Venus and Jupiter as slingshots. The slumbering, lumbering machine was awakened every six months to prove that it still was sensate. On arrival, 1,275 billion kilometres from home, the Cassini orbiter's cameras revealed the existence of 10 previously unknown Saturnian moons and bore witness to the extraordinary turbulence of the planet's atmosphere, including a hurricane with winds of 560 km/h and another storm that exceeded in area even the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. The Huygens lander-a steamer-trunk-sized contraption crammed with spectrometers, radiometers, and other relics of the prehistoric '80s-was orphaned from the orbiter on Earth-Christmas Day 2004 and parachuted to a successful touchdown on Titan two weeks later. Its camera soon expired, but the nestling remained in place amid the ice-pebbles of the giant moon's cr\u00e8me- br\u00fbl\u00e9e crust in a region called Xanadu, where the afternoon temperature is -171\u00b0 C. Its child gone, lonely Cassini maintained its Saturn orbit, just outside the outer \"F ring,\" for more than a decade, occasionally swinging down to an altitude as low as 140,000 km from the surface. This still was not close enough to determine whether or not, as John Jacob Astor IV wrote in 1894 in his novel A Journey In Other Worlds: A Romance of the Future , \"the ground was strewn with large coloured crystals, apparently rubies, sapphires and emeralds, about the size of hens' eggs.\" On July 4, 2014, plans were announced on Earth to terminate Cassini's mission through the agencies of gravity, momentum and murder. The spacecraft's demise was fixed for Sept. 15, 2017, one month shy of the 20th anniversary of its launch, and 13 years after it first penetrated the rocky, icy, gossamer rings of the many-coloured sixth planet from the sun. Discoverer of tiny, unguessed orbs and prober of alien ecologies, Cassini- Huygens was to be steered toward its own demise by its Earth-bound controllers. Planetary scientists explained this dastardly act-NASA sanitized it as \"the Grand Finale\"-as being in the best interests of future life-seeking missions to Titan or Enceladus, lest an unplanned crash allow a single terrestrial microbial stowaway in Cassini's instrument cluster to pollute the underground oceans or Superior-sized methane-ethane lakes of Saturn's tantalizing Caramilk moons. Cassini-Huygens will be mourned on Earth as one of the most successful and revelatory robots ever sent skyward, and on Saturn itself by the planet's paramount ruler, who was described by Voltaire in his story Microm\u00e9gas in 1752 as \"a pretty, petite brunette who was only 660 fathoms tall, but who compensated for this small size with many other charms.\" In addition to Astor, who died on the Titanic, the spacecraft was predeceased by its eponyms, and it outlasted the great Voltaire, if not the Frenchman's works, including Microm\u00e9gas, in which a voyageur from the solar system of Sirius visits lovely Saturn, and converses with one of its inhabitants on the meaning of life and death. \"Alas!\" the French philosophe wrote, quoting the comely Saturnian. \"We only live through 500 revolutions around the sun.\" \"You can see yourself that this is to die almost at the moment one is born; our existence is a point, our lifespan an instant, our planet an atom.

Twenty days later, in January 2005, Huygens became the first spacecraft to land on an object in the outer solar system. To this day, the Huygens probe's touchdown on Saturn's moon Titan remains the most distant landing ever achieved by humankind. Titan turned out to be a fascinating alien world. Under the thick orangish clouds that surround the moon, flowing rivers and lakes of hydrocarbons make Titan the only object in space other than Earth that is known to have stable bodies of surface liquid. On Titan, temperatures remain hundreds of degrees below zero.

Even though Huygens had only minutes to transmit data to Cassini before the mothership dipped below Titan's horizon, leaving Huygens cut off from humanity, the little probe still managed to reveal the rugged highlands and intricate ravines and drainage channels that crisscross the mysterious world. \"The Huygens images were everything our images from orbit were not,\" said Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging team lead, in a JPL press release. \"Instead of hazy, sinuous features that we could only guess were streams and drainage channels, here was incontrovertible evidence that at some point in Titan's history-and perhaps even now-there were flowing liquid hydrocarbons on the surface.

The Cassini spacecraft --- now in what NASA terms its \"ring-grazing\" orbits phase, is giving researchers an opportunity to observe features of the rings themselves. NASA says the new images resolve details as small as 0.3 miles, which is on the scale of Earth's tallest buildings. \"All planetary rings are made of icy rubble as small as talcum powder all the way up to the size of apartment buildings,\" planetary scientist Carolyn Porco, Cassini's imaging team leader and a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley, told me. What we see when we see Saturn's rings from a distance is the shape they take due to gravity, she says. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory says that the rings are generally about 30 feet thick or so and are almost completely composed of billions of chunks of water ice. It's been quite a ride since the Cassini mission arrived at Saturn in 2004. First detected by Galileo in 1610, the rings have been the subject of some of the most stunning images NASA has ever beamed back from space. Porco notes that the rings are important to all of astronomy and astrophysics because they allow researchers to better understand how cosmic systems are organized into disks, noting that both spiral galaxies and solar systems form disks. \"So, we've long regarded Saturn's rings as a touchstone for understanding disk systems on cosmic scales ,\" said Porco. Of particular interest has been the observed structure inside the rings themselves. Given monikers like \"straw\" and \"propellers,\" JPL says the propellers are now known to be caused by the gravitational influence of moonlets. That is, lumps of ring material that are estimated to be half a mile in diameter. What's most surprising about the latest images? Their level of detail, says Porco. \" This gives us an opportunity to understand the most basic processes operating in the rings ,\" she said. And although they can appear distinct, smooth and esthetically stunning when seen at a distance, Porco is quick to point out that Saturn's ring system is really just one gravitationally-sculpted continuous disk of debris. It's those very detailed structures in the rings that give us insight into how the particles behave, says Porco. \"That's what we really want to know, which is important for understanding the initial stages of planet formation,\" said Porco. NASA says Cassini's ring-grazing will continue until late April.

Along with NASA and ESA, the Italian Space Agency is also a part of the Cassini-Huygens mission. Since its remarkable arrival on Saturn's orbital plane, the Cassini spacecraft and Huygens probe has made ground-breaking discoveries and has transmitted countless images of what life is like on Saturn and its moons. Take a look at this spectacular hurricane that occurred on Saturn's north pole captured by Cassini's narrow-angle camera. The image was taken using a combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light. The hurricane closely resembles those that occurs on Earth where an eye with no clouds or very low clouds are observed. High- density clouds form an eye wall, other high clouds circle around the eye, and a counter-clockwise rotation takes place in the northern hemisphere. At an extreme speed, the outer clouds travel at 540 km/h while the hurricane's eye incredibly spans at around 2000 km. Cassini's radar managed to detect a few dozen lakes that exist on Titan's surface, ranging from 0.6 miles wide to around 20 miles in width. These lakes consist of methane and ethane liquids replenished by rain from hydrocarbon clouds. Aurora borealis or northern lights already look incredible when they happen in the Earth's atmosphere. But did you know that this spectacular phenomenon of burning cosmic dust also occurs in Saturn? This image of an aurora borealis happening at the north pole of Saturn looks amazing with the use of contrasting wavelengths of infrared lights.

In one final pass through the icy moon's liquid plumes, NASA's Cassini spacecraft found molecular hydrogen, which indicates favourable conditions for life in Enceladus's subsurface sea. For over a decade, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its moons, sending back the best pictures and measurements we've ever had of the system. It dropped off the Huygens probe at hazy Titan, scrutinised the structure of Saturn's rings, and revealed that Enceladus was much stranger than anyone expected. Enceladus's south pole has strange, warm fractures, and plumes of liquid water coming from an internal ocean many believed was impossible in such a small, cold world. The plumes also contain enticing compounds like organics and carbon dioxide, all necessary for life as we know it on Earth. Those things represent tantalising hints of habitability. But there was no evidence for an energy source to feed potential life, until now. In extreme environments on Earth, hydrogen can play that role. \"What was missing to complete the story of habitability was an energy source,\" says Chris McKay at NASA's Ames Research Center in California. \"This completes that story.\" Cassini did detect hydrogen in early trips through the plumes, but there was no way to determine if it came from the moon itself or from inside the instrument. When particles from the plumes entered the spacecraft's Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer , they interacted with its titanium walls, producing the same sort of hydrogen as hydrothermal processes would produce under Enceladus's ocean. \"We didn't know we were going to do this experiment when we launched Cassini,\" says Hunter Waite at the Southwest Research Institute in Texas. So to look for hydrogen, Waite and his team had to put the INMS instrument in a new mode that measured the molecules without allowing them to touch the walls. Finally, they found the molecular hydrogen they were looking for - and a lot of it. Their findings indicated that there was too much hydrogen to be stored in tiny Enceladus's ice shell or ocean. That means it must be continuously produced there, probably by hydrothermal reactions similar to those that occur near hot vents at the bottom of Earth's oceans. Near those vents on Earth, there is life. Some of Earth's oldest microorganisms, called methanogens, are often found near hydrothermal vents where, deprived of light and oxygen, they convert hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane. \"If you were to take methanogens from Earth's ocean and transport them to Enceladus, they would have all the food they need,\" says Waite. \"This is like candy for microbes.\" If Earth microbes could exist on Enceladus, maybe it could have homegrown life, too. Between its liquid water, organic molecules, and hydrogen, Enceladus is looking more and more like our best bet for finding extraterrestrial life. \"If we're looking for life in the solar system, then Enceladus has a lot of potential to be the place that we could find it,\" says Kelly Miller at SwRI, who was part of the team that discovered Enceladus' molecular hydrogen. Showing Enceladus is habitable is one thing, finding life is quite another. \"Just because a place is suitable for life doesn't mean that life is present, because we don't understand the origin of life at all,\" McKay says. Some believe that life is inevitable, given the right conditions. Others think that it is rare and requires a great deal of luck. Right now, our sample of definitely habitable worlds has only one: Earth. But pairing observations of Enceladus with our own planet could help astrobiologists figure out the likelihood of life existing elsewhere in the universe. \"The message is in the molecules,\" says Christopher Glein, another member of Waite's group at SwRI. \"We just have to keep measuring the molecules in that plume, and that's going to tell us about what we cannot see.\" We won't have any more molecules from Enceladus's plumes for a long time, though. Cassini is running low on fuel, and if it were to crash into Enceladus it might destroy any extraterrestrial ecosystem living there. To protect potential life on Saturn's ocean moons, we have to destroy the only tool we have to find it. The spacecraft will crash into Saturn on 15 September. Even if an Enceladus mission is selected in NASA's next round of New Frontiers funding, to be announced in 2019, it wouldn't reach the Saturn system until the late 2020s or early 2030s. \"To address whether there is life, we'll have to go back,\" McKay says. \"Two decades can go by pretty fast.\" ", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127926-cassini-finds-final-ingredient-for-alien-life-in-enceladuss-sea/"}, {"title": "The Cassini spacecraft's dive in between Saturn's rings, explained", "date": "2017-04-26", "content": "The spacecraft begins its \"grand finale\" before crashing into the gas giant later this year. The Cassini spacecraft is going where no ship has gone before: On Wednesday, it begins a series of dives into the space between Saturn and its magnificent rings. The maneuver - a series of 22 orbits that will bring Cassini increasingly closer to Saturn's surface before crashing into it - is called the spacecraft's \"grand finale.\" And to mark this final journey, Cassini is being honored with a Google Doodle. Over its last 13 years in orbit, Cassini has had an amazing run studying Saturn and its moons. Here's what the spacecraft has taught us so far - and why its final mission may be its most spectacular yet. In its last days, Cassini keeps generating fascinating insights. Cassini - named after the 17th-century astronomer Giovanni Cassini - launched from Cape Canaveral in October 1997 in collaboration with the European Space Agency. When it launched, we were still a few months away from Bill Clinton's damning \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman\" remark. Harry Potter had not yet been published in the United States. From there, it took Cassini and the Huygens lander (destined to touch down on the moon Titan) seven years to reach Saturn. Once it arrived, it started to make impressive discoveries. On Titan, Cassini and Huygens revealed surprisingly Earthlike geographic features and great lakes of liquid natural gas on the moon's surface that outweigh all the oil and gas reserves on Earth. Cassini found evidence of an underground ocean on the moon Enceladus. It learned how new moons could form out of Saturn's rings. And it has taken detailed, beautiful photographic surveys of the planet's rings and surface features. Nearing the end of its life, Cassini is still producing scientific discoveries at a fast clip. Earlier in April, NASA announced that the spacecraft had found the most compelling evidence yet that the ocean underneath Enceladus could contain life. Previously, the Cassini spacecraft has observed jets of water containing organic chemicals streaming from Enceladus. This latest finding adds a key ingredient for life to the mix: hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen in the jets makes NASA scientists suspect there are geothermal geysers on Enceladus's ocean floor. Like the geothermal vents deep within Earth's oceans, these could be home to microbes that use the chemical energy of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce methane and energy for life. Now Cassini is beginning a series of harrowing orbits that bring it into the space between Saturn and its rings - a region no spacecraft has been before. When Cassini is in the inner rings, it will finally be able to take the measurements that will aid in calculations to determine the mass of the rings. Why NASA is diving into the space between Saturn and its rings. On Wednesday, Cassini begins a maneuver that is unprecedented in the history of spaceflight: It's adjusting its trajectory to bring it inside the 1,500-mile-wide gap between Saturn and its rings for 22 orbits. This is what that dive will look like from Cassini's perspective. In these illustrations, the blue lines represent each of the 22 orbits getting closer and closer to the atmosphere of the giant planet. The red line represents the final orbit, which will end with Cassini crashing into Saturn's atmosphere. In this space, Cassini will be able to take new measurements to better determine the total mass of Saturn's rings. NASA already knows the mass of Saturn plus its rings. Getting closer to the planet will allow Cassini to take its mass without factoring in the rings. That information will help scientists better understand how the rings formed (which in turn can help them understand how all the planets formed from rings of material around the sun). The orbits will also produce the closest-ever observations of Saturn's clouds - yielding incredible images. It will be a thrilling journey, but also a perilous one. NASA has saved the ring-grazing orbits for Cassini's finale in part because they are dangerous. The orbits will bring Cassini close to debris and rocks that could take it offline. \"We're going out in a blaze of glory\". Come September 15, Cassini will crash into Saturn, having spent all of its fuel. But the death dive isn't just for fireworks. If the spacecraft doesn't plunge into Saturn's atmosphere, it runs the risk of potentially contaminating one of the planet's moons with debris and microbes from Earth. And there's no turning back: \"The spacecraft is now on a ballistic path,\" Earl Maize, a Cassini project manager, said in a press statement, meaning that the spacecraft's path is shaped mostly by gravity, not by thrusters. \"Even if we were to forgo future small course adjustments using thrusters, we would still enter Saturn's atmosphere on Sept. 15 no matter what.\" Cassini's dramatic finale is also a last chance to squeeze some more insights out of the 20-year-old spacecraft. As it descends into Saturn's atmosphere, \"several of the instruments will be on,\" including the mass spectrometer, Preston Dyches, a NASA spokesperson, says. This instrument essentially can \"sniff\" the atmosphere and determine the chemical compounds it's composed of. On April 12, days before it made its final flyby of Titan, Cassini captured this incredible image of Earth shining through Saturn's rings, as if to remind us of how far it's come since beginning its journey. From Saturn, we're just a tiny bright speck in the darkness.

But how far from reality is this? Going by Cassini-Huygens' findings, perhaps it's not too far! Cassini-Huygens is the first unmanned spacecraft to orbit Saturn, a spectacular ringed planet in our Solar System. Launched on October 15, 1997, it set out to discover the planet and its satellites, up-close. In its twenty long years, the spacecraft has revealed many fascinating facts about Saturn, its rings, and its moons, including some clues about the possibility of life. However, all good things come to an end, and Cassini-Huygens is all set to draw a close to its eventful life in September 2017. In the first seven years of its journey, the spacecraft hovered around Venus, flew past Mars, manoeuvred through the asteroid belt and slid past Jupiter, before finally entering Saturn's orbit on July 1, 2004. Its end, equally special, will start on April 22, 2017, when it sails past Titan bidding a parting farewell, then criss-crossing Saturn's equator 22 times, and finally sinking into Saturn. According to NASA, the agency controlling the spacecraft, its thrusters have run out of fuel, forcing the inevitable death. Cassini-Huygens - A Flagship Mission Scientists at NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency, started the groundwork on Cassini-Huygens back in 1980s. Named after two Italian astronomers, Giovanni Cassini, who studied Saturn's rings, and Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Titan, the spacecraft has two parts - the Cassini orbiter that orbits Saturn, and the Huygens probe that landed on Titan. Since Saturn is so far away from the Sun, it is infeasible to harness solar rays as a power source. Hence, Cassini-Huygens is powered with limited- period plutonium radioisotope electric generators that generate electricity like a nuclear power plant. While Cassini was in orbit around Saturn, sandwiched between its two rings, it detached Huygens to descend on Titan on December 25, 2004. Huygens, after falling freely for 20 days, entered the history books as the first robotic probe to land on a satellite of another planet. It captured every detail of Titan's atmosphere and surface, and sent it to NASA's Deep Space Network until its batteries drained up. Understanding Saturn, its rings and moons Saturn, with its majestic rings and enigmatic moons, is a jewel in our Solar System. It is the second largest planet after Jupiter, and is a gas giant made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its diameter is approximately 9 times that of the Earth, and it is 95 times more massive than the Earth. It is also the only planet in the Solar System that is less dense than water. Until recently, these were the only facts about Saturn that we knew. Cassini-Huygens has tremendously increased our understanding of the Saturnian system. With numerous up-close observations, it has pointed out many earth- like features on Saturn. We now know that Saturn has numerous 'jet streams' that spew water vapour and heat into the atmosphere, of which the hexagonal jet stream in the north pole is one. Photographs by Cassini have revealed the magnificent symmetry of this stream and has shown this to be a long-lived phenomenon. Cassini has captured glimpses of 'lightnings' and 'hurricanes' in the Saturnian atmosphere, and has studied the seasonal 'Great White Storm' - a once in 30 years phenomenon. It has also studied Saturn's auroras, atmospheric composition, the swelling of its outer atmosphere, and the planet's rate of rotation, even correcting previous values by six minutes. By the end of its life, Cassini would have orbited Saturn 293 times, observing it for half a Saturn year. The system of rings around Saturn is expansive and bright, and hence easily visible through a telescope. Named alphabetically based on when they were discovered, the rings consist of numerous icy rocks, ranging from the size of a grain of salt to the size of a mountain. With Cassini, scientists now have data about the size, temperature, composition and distribution of Saturn's rings. It has studied the interactions between rings and moons, and has recorded instances of some moons stealing particles from a ring, or throwing particles into a ring. Saturn's equinox, when sunrays strike the rings on the edges, provides the perfect opportunity to capture intricate details and features of the rings. Cassini has used this occasion to observe previously unknown or poorly understood phenomena like the \"spokes\" in the rings, finger-like radial features that rotate along with the rings, like spokes in a wheel. Images captured during equinox also show that in places, Saturn's rings are far less smooth than was thought. Saturn has 62 known moons and numerous moonlets. Though early missions like Voyager and Pioneer provided a rough sketch of Saturn's moons, it was poorly understood. Cassini has discovered seven new moons and revealed how each moon is unique and sharply different from the others. With high-resolution, close- up images of some of the moons - Phoebe, Enceladus, Iapetus, Rhea, Hyperion, Dione, and Titan, captured during fly-bys, we now know that most of these moons have cratered surfaces, some contain atmospheres and large amounts of ice, hinting at the possibility of life. The most remarkable contribution of this spacecraft is the exploration of Titan. When Cassini flew by Titan, it saw beyond the orange haze of methane clouds, and revealed the presence of huge 'lakes' and 'seas' of liquid hydrocarbons. After Huygens landed on Titan, it revealed that Titan actually has a climate system like Earth, with a 'water cycle', where liquid hydrocarbons evaporate to form clouds, and later precipitate as rain. There was also evidence of an internal, liquid ocean beneath Titan's surface, likely composed of water and ammonia. Cassini also helped answer the reason behind Enceladus being the brightest object in the Solar System. It showed that beneath the icy crust of Enceladus, there may be an underground ocean, from which water vapour and ice particles frequently erupted. Subsequently, it detected water, carbon dioxide and various hydrocarbons, the presence of a unique chemistry and internal heat - the right composition to support life. This excited scientists looking for life, proclaiming Enceladus to be one of the 'most likely places in the Solar System to host alien microbial life'. This discovery also gave a peek into how our Earth might have been before life originated. A Grand Farewell Cassini-Huygens has provided us with an intimate understanding of Saturn, its moons and its rings and has opened up a treasure trove of information. It has solved several intriguing mysteries and answered long standing questions about the Saturnian system. But, can life exist on Saturn? Cassinis's vital clues have kept scientists pondering on that, while it begins its final journey to become one among Saturn's specks of dust.

After more than a decade of ground-breaking discoveries, and with little fuel left, it has been decided to end the mission by plunging it into Saturn's atmosphere on 15 September 2017. The UK has involvement on 4 instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft, including as the Principal Investigator for the magnetometer, built to measure planetary and inter-planetary magnetic fields and developed by a team at Imperial College, London. Like a highly-sensitive and extremely precise compass, Cassini's Magnetometer records the direction and strength of magnetic fields around the spacecraft. This helps scientists learn about the interiors of Saturn and its moons, along with the planet's magnetosphere - the giant region of space around the planet influenced by its magnetic field. The instrument has a long history and was built by Professor David Southwood and his team at Imperial College. It was selected for the NASA spacecraft in 1991 and work began immediately. David moved to ESA the same month Cassini launched in 1997 and management of the instrument was passed to his successor, Professor Michele Dougherty. Professor Dougherty, Professor of Space Physics at Imperial College, said: Today's first close in dive by the Cassini spacecraft in between the rings and atmosphere of Saturn signals the start of its final mission phase, the > Grand Finale, where the focus will be on understanding the interior of > Saturn, its rings and atmosphere and last but not least how long a day is on > Saturn. With the repeated dives in the as yet unvisited region, Cassini will conclude its journey by collecting unprecedented data to address fundamental questions about the origin of Saturn and its ring system. The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft embarked on a seven-year voyage across the Solar System, eventually reaching Saturn in July 2004. Several months later, the Cassini orbiter released ESA's Huygens probe, which landed on Titan on 14 January 2005 - the first landing in the outer Solar System. Combining the data collected in situ by Huygens and the observations performed by Cassini during flybys of Titan, the mission revealed the atmospheric processes of this moon and their seasonal evolution, as well as the surface morphology and interior structure, which may include a liquid water ocean. Enshrouded by a thick nitrogen-dominated atmosphere and partly covered by lakes and rivers, Titan has a weather and hydrological cycle that bears some interesting similarities to Earth. However, there are important differences: the key component there is not water, like on our planet, but methane, and the temperature is very low, around -180\u00b0C at the surface. Another of Cassini's breakthroughs was the detection of a towering plume of water vapour and organic material spraying into space from warm fractures near the south pole of Saturn's icy moon, Enceladus. These salt-rich jets indicate that an underground sea of liquid water is lurking only a few kilometres below the moon's icy surface, which was confirmed by gravity and rotation measurements. A recent analysis of data collected during flybys of Enceladus with the Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer also revealed hydrogen gas in the plume, suggesting that rock might be reacting with warm water on the seafloor of the moon's subsurface ocean. This hydrothermal activity could provide a chemical energy source for life, enabling non-photosynthetic biological processes. This is similar to the activity found near the hydrothermal vents on the Earth's ocean floor and points to the potential habitability of Enceladus' underground ocean.

And like the first ring-crossing two weeks ago, this one required a bit of complicated piloting. Remote-controlling a robot spaceship from 750 million miles away ain't like dusting crops, as Han Solo might say. Cassini's first dramatic pass through the rings of Saturn on April 26 involved some acrobatics. Step one: Get a gravity boost from the moon Titan. In fact, that's how Cassini has been moving around the system since its arrival in 2004 ---rather than burn precious propellant, the craft tucks into Titan's orbit and then slingshots back out again. This most recent boost was a delicate one, just 609 miles above Titan's surface and not even ten miles above the moon's wan atmosphere. Space, as we keep telling you, is hard. \"Any gravity assist that we do is never going to be perfect, because we can't model everything perfectly,\" says Sonia Hernandez, a mission design engineer for Cassini at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"Two days after the last Titan flyby we did, we performed a maneuver to put Cassini on its trajectory again. It was very tiny.\" How tiny? First, the spacecraft team put Cassini's three reaction wheels to work. They're spinning discs that, when their rotation slows, cause the entire spacecraft to move around the flywheel's axis. They're a way to change the probe's orientation without burning fuel. That's how the spacecraft team points the Reaction Control System thrusters---smaller than the main engine and powered by hydrazine---in the right direction. Then Hernandez's navigation team sent the signal to fire the RCS thrusters for just 177 seconds, at 155 millimeters per second. In other words, the burn moved the craft in a different direction by about 80 feet. Here's a complicated bit: Even though that first maneuver, carefully calculated weeks in advance, happened before the first ring crossing, the team did it to correct the orbit on the third crossing---the one happening Wednesday. That's how these loop-the-loops work: Small problems turn into big ones unless you deal with them early. And on Wednesday they're going to do it again---to make sure dive number 13 is perfect. \"We're going so close to the atmosphere and the rings, there's all these perturbations,\" Hernandez says. So this one will be even more delicate. Cassini's high-gain antenna starts out pointed directly at Earth---good for receiving all these commands. Using the reaction wheels again, they'll make two careful turns over the course of about 45 minutes. It can take upwards of an hour and a half for commands to reach Cassini, depending on where it is in orbit, so these sequences are all pre-set. By the end, the antenna will be turned about 120 degrees away from Earth. Then, says Joan Stupik, of Cassini's guidance and control team, they'll fire the RCS thrusters again. This time it's just 22 mm per second for 24 seconds. It's precision flying to make sure the science team gets the exact data it wants---pretty pictures, sure, but also new information about the size of the particles in the rings, what they're made of, and where that material comes from. Cassini'll keep circling Saturn until September 15---NASA's \" Grand Finale\" ---when the little probe will dive into the planet. \"On the last route that we do around Saturn, we actually encounter Titan one last time,\" says Hernandez. \"It'll give us a tiny push, a goodbye kiss, and that's going give us our final push into the atmosphere.\" Cassini will collect data all the way down, of course.

Fresh off its fifth passage through a gap between Saturn's atmosphere and rings, NASA's robotic Cassini spacecraft is looping toward a close brush with the planet's innermost ring next week, when the probe will again use its high- gain antenna as a shield against icy particles that may lie in its path. Cassini made another safe trip through the 1,500-mile space between Saturn and its rings at 0311 GMT Monday, according to NASA, marking the fifth time the craft has dived through the previously-unexplored region since late April. During its latest ring passage, the orbiter's instruments were expected to measure Saturn's gravitational field and gather data on the mass of the planet's rings. Cassini's Cosmic Dust Analyzer instrument was also supposed to collect and analyze ring particles on this week's flyby. \"Interplanetary meteoroids bombard Saturn's main rings, depositing silicates, organics, and metals in the ring particles,\" scientists wrote in a description of this week's flight through the ring gap. \"The more of those contaminants the CDA finds, the older Saturn's rings probably are.\" NASA tweeted from Cassini's account Monday that the flyby was successful. The plutonium-powered spacecraft is in its final months, with its orbit around Saturn now taking it on weekly plunges through the ring gap. Data recorded during the close-up flybys will help tell scientists the age of Saturn's rings, which will indicate their likely origin. More measurements of the rings' mass and Saturn's magnetic field, atmosphere and internal structure are also on tap during Cassini's final months. The orbiter is heading for a Sept. 15 plunge into Saturn's atmosphere, a guided dive during which Cassini will be crushed and vaporized. The craft is running low on fuel, and officials want to ensure the probe is destroyed before losing control of it. Scientists worry that Cassini could eventually collide with one of Saturn's habitable moons, such as Titan or Enceladus, and spoil future discoveries. Cassini's next journey through the ring gap is set for 1422 GMT Sunday, May 28, when the spacecraft will make its closest brush with the inner edge of Saturn's D ring, a belt of tiny ice particles encircling the planet. Ground controllers will command the spacecraft to point its dish-shaped antenna in its direction of travel during Sunday's approach as a safeguard against potentially damaging impacts from ring particles. So far, scientists have detected fewer strikes from icy debris in the ring gap than predicted, allowing engineers to forego using the antenna as a shield during the last four flybys. Cautious managers directed the antenna to point forward - in its so-called \"ram\" position - during Cassini's first flight through the ring gap last month. Objectives during Sunday's flyby include unprecedented radar observations of the structure of Saturn's rings, up-close imaging of the rings, and listening for particle impacts with one of Cassini's science instruments. Because the high-gain antenna will not be aimed at Earth, Cassini will be out of contact with mission control during Sunday's encounter. The craft is scheduled to radio its status back to Earth around 0329 GMT Monday, May 29. Cassini will come close to Saturn's D ring on three more occasions in June and July, when it will again use its antenna for protection.

Cassini captured the public imagination with its stunning images of the gas giant Saturn and its up-close examination of the planet's flowing ring system. Over the years, the probe discovered new moons around Saturn, and dug deep into the strange environments of the two largest Saturnian satellites. \"Kingdom of Saturn: Cassini's Epic Quest\" reviews the historical figures who laid the groundwork for the mission, the probe's major discoveries, and how the probe connected with people on Earth. The movie is available to watch now on Amazon. Cassini left Earth in October 1997 as part of the Cassini-Huygens mission, a joint effort by NASA and the European Space Agency. The Huygens probe was dropped onto Saturn's moon Titan in January 2005, about six months after arriving at Saturn. Since 2008, Cassini has been operating on extended scientific missions. Now that the probe is running out of fuel, scientists have decided to crash the probe into Saturn. This will not only provide a close-up glimpse of the planet and its rings, but will also guarantee that the probe will never accidentally crash into one of the planet's potentially habitable moons. \"Kingdom of Saturn\" provides a tour of the planet and its rings, highlighting fascinating details like the hexagonal cloud formation at its north pole, and its extraordinary system of ring s, which are 30 million times wider than they are high. \"Cassini has traveled nearly 4 billion kilometers 2.48 billion miles, delivered a probe to the surface of a toxic moon, spent 20 Earth years in space, and produced science nine years longer than originally planned,\" the film's narrator says, summarizing some of Cassini's major accomplishments. \"Cassini has discovered flowing water where none was expected, phantasmagorical structures on a planet's icy rings, a weirdly breathing magnetosphere, and a possible abode of life on a tiny world with a startling atmosphere.\" The movie also shows viewers how Cassini's investigations of Saturn have not only helped scientists understand Earth's solar system, but also planetary systems around other stars. Saturn itself is an example of the gas giants that have now been found around thousands of stars, and Cassini has helped scientists better understand how these monsters form. \"The science based on Cassini's data will go on for decades,\" the film's narrator says. Since Cassini arrived at Saturn, scientists have found more evidence that the planet's moons Enceladus and Titan could potentially host life. Enceladus may possess a liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface, with a geologic source of heat. Geysers of water spew up through cracks in the moon's surface, and Cassini flew through one of the geysers and sampled its composition. Titan's surface is mostly covered in liquid methane and ethane, rather than water, which means \"if anything lives on Titan, it is almost surely not related to life on Earth,\" according to the documentary. The documentary dives deep into Cassini's investigation of these particularly interesting moons. The documentary doesn't keep its focus exclusively on space; it covers the historical figures after whom the Cassini and Huygens probes are named, and it touches on the time just before Cassini's launch when protesters urged NASA and ESA to cancel the mission over fears the launch rocket might explode and release the radioactive material contained inside the probe. Cassini will make its final death dive on Sept. 15, 2017, at 5 p.m. EDT. Check out \"Kingdom of Saturn\" before the world says goodbye to the Saturn probe forever.

On 15 September, the spacecraft will plunge into Saturn's atmosphere and disintegrate. > It's \"a region where no spacecraft has flown before.\" The last stage of the mission, the so-called \"grand finale\" orbits, began on 22 April with a gravitational boost from Titan. Since then, Cassini has slowly descended closer and closer to Saturn to explore the space between the rings and the planet itself. It's \"a region where no spacecraft has flown before,\" said Linda Spilker, the Cassini- Huygens mission head scientist. Currently, Cassini is completing grand finale orbit 16 out of the final 22: It takes 6 days to complete an orbit. In these last orbits, the spacecraft has already snapped images from the never-before-seen perspective between the rings and Saturn. In a matter of weeks, it will skim the planet's atmosphere. From now until Cassini crashes, its mission will be to start answering some long-standing questions about Saturn itself. Here are three of those questions. A long-running debate in Saturn science involves the age of the rings : Some researchers think they're young, about 100 million years old, and some researchers think they could be 4 or 5 billion years old. \"If we had been around 4 billion years ago, what would Saturn's rings have looked like?\" asks Richard French, the team leader of Cassini's Radio Science Subsystem , a payload that studies Saturn's gravitational field. \"Would they be similar to what they are now, or would they have evolved over time?\" Voyager and Hubble data suggested that because the rings are bright and seemingly untarnished by interplanetary dust that rains inward from the Kuiper belt, the rings are young. Some estimates give an age of around 100 million years old, said Jeffrey Cuzzi, a planetary scientist on the mission who studies Saturn's rings. If they were very old, some researchers postulate, the water ice chunks that make up Saturn's rings would be duller and darker. However, there's still a problem with this reasoning, Cuzzi said. Scientists generally agree that the rings probably formed from a catastrophic breakup of a moon. But 100 million years ago, the solar system was less chaotic than in its earlier days. \"It's hard to find a way to destroy a moon\" in this more recent environment, he noted. On Earth 100 million years ago, dinosaurs were thriving-evidence of a relatively calm system. By contrast, between about 3.8 and 4 billion years ago, the adolescent solar system went through the Late Heavy Bombardment, with large objects hurling every which way. Evidence of this chaos is scattered across the solar system in craters. Those are just two of many arguments trying to explain the rings' age. One way to rule out some of these arguments is a precise measurement of the rings' mass, Cuzzi said. Cassini data suggest that the mass would be similar to Saturn's current moon Mimas. But how much mass would this have been, precisely? If the rings are light, that could roughly indicate their youth: Debris from a smaller, lighter moon might have dispersed completely if the catastrophic event happened 4 or 5 billion years ago, French said. If the rings are relatively heavy, then evolution models favor ring formation during the Late Heavy Bombardment. \"The larger the precursor moon, the larger the mass of the ring, the harder it is for that ring to evolve over time,\" he continued. That's where the RSS comes in. Cassini sends radio waves to Earth, which are picked up by NASA's giant radio antennas around the world. While Cassini is in the gap between Saturn's rings and Saturn itself, scientists can evaluate how much Cassini gets tugged by the planet's gravity and by its rings' gravity. These tugs directly relate to the mass of the rings, which scientists hope to nail down with the final RSS measurements. It may seem like an easy question to answer, but scientists aren't sure how long a day lasts on Saturn. Determining the precise rotational period of the gas giant proves difficult because Saturn lacks static features and hosts no classic \"surface\" to speak of. So scientists cannot decouple the dynamic atmosphere seen in images from whatever may be below it. But gas giants have magnetic fields, created by internal processes such as rotating electrical fluids, that scientists can track. If a magnetic field is tilted compared with its rotational axis, it'll cause detectable wobbles. Such is the case for Jupiter. Researchers easily determined its orbital period because of its tilted magnetic field. Not so with Saturn. Its magnetic field is almost perfectly aligned with its rotational axis, providing no significant wobbles for Cassini to detect from far away. What's more, the small signal that researchers can detect changes from the north to the south pole, said Michele Dougherty, the principal investigator for Cassini's magnetometer instrument. Saturn's day seems to be between \"10.6 and 10.8 hours long, probably, but the signal we're seeing, we're not sure it's linked to the interior at all,\" she said in a press statement. So far, researchers haven't found the answer: Cassini data have shown that Saturn's magnetic field is tilted less than 0.06\u00b0 from its rotational axis, not a promising tilt to determine the length of a day. Scientists think something deep in Saturn's atmosphere may be masking the signal from the magnetic field, and they hope that getting even closer to the planet may finally reveal this basic characteristic, Dougherty said. During the 18th grand finale orbit, between 10 and 17 August, Cassini will, for the first time, skim across the top of Saturn's atmosphere. In the final five orbits, the spacecraft will collect data on the neutral molecules of the upper atmosphere, such as hydrogen, helium, water, and methane, said Scott Edgington, the Cassini-Huygens's team deputy project scientist. The instruments \"will also be poised to detect more complex molecules created after molecules such as methane and water are broken up by solar ultraviolet photons and electron impact,\" Edgington said. \"Titan surprised many of the atmospheric scientists with a rich set of complex ions in the upper atmosphere, thus causing us to rethink our theories and models of the upper atmosphere,\" he continued. \"Will Saturn do the same?\" ", "url": "https://eos.org/articles/a-wealth-of-science-to-come-during-cassinis-final-orbits"}, {"title": "Cassini Burns Into Saturn - Cassini Burns Into Saturn", "date": "2017-09-08", "content": "NASA's Cassini spacecraft will plunge into Saturn on September 15, incinerating itself after 20 years in space.

The space agency had no other choice. Cassini was nearly out of fuel and had already been stretched years beyond its intended mission duration. Keeping it going risked potentially contaminating one of Saturn's moons - like Enceladus, an ice world that has some ingredients for life, or Titan, a dynamic moon where it rains methane - with microbes from Earth. And so the spacecraft ended its existence by literally going where no human-made object has gone before: into Saturn's atmosphere. But up through its very last moments, Cassini was conducting a scientific investigation. As it descended into Saturn's atmosphere, several of its instruments were turned on, including the mass spectrometer, which could essentially \"sniff\" the atmosphere and determine the chemical compounds therein. That data was beamed back in real time, and will be analyzed in the coming weeks and months. Cassini has made discoveries that have changed our understanding of Saturn and the cosmos at large. The spacecraft discovered whole new moons around Saturn, lakes of methane on Titan, jets of water erupting from Enceladus. It expanded our understanding where life could possibly exist in our solar system and in the broader universe. And it gave us a pristine window to observe Saturn's rings, an environment believed to be similar to the rings of debris that formed the entire solar system.

Its final descent into Saturn's atmosphere began about an hour and a half earlier, but the signal took that long to reach Earth because of the vast distance. Cassini's plunge into the ringed gas giant - the furthest planet visible from Earth with the naked eye - came after the spacecraft ran out of rocket fuel after a journey of some 4.9 billion miles (7.9 billion kilometers). Its well-planned demise was a way to prevent any damage to Saturn's ocean-bearing moons Titan and Enceladus, which scientists want to keep pristine for future exploration because they may contain some form of life. \"There are international treaties that require that we can't just leave a derelict spacecraft in orbit around a planet like Saturn, which has prebiotic moons,\" said Maize. Three other spacecraft have flown by Saturn - Pioneer 11 in 1979, followed by Voyager 1 and 2 in the 1980s. But none have studied Saturn in such detail as Cassini, named after the French-Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who discovered in the 17th century that Saturn had several moons and a gap between its rings. Cassini launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida in 1997, then spent seven years in transit followed by 13 years orbiting Saturn. In that time, it discovered six more moons around Saturn, three-dimensional structures towering above Saturn's rings, and a giant storm that raged across the planet for nearly a year. The 22 by 13 foot (6.7 by 4 meter) spacecraft is also credited with discovering icy geysers erupting from Saturn's moon Enceladus, and eerie hydrocarbon lakes made of ethane and methane on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. In 2005, the Cassini orbiter released a lander called Huygens on Titan, marking the first and only such landing in the outer solar system, on a celestial body beyond the asteroid belt. Huygens was a joint project of the European Space Agency, Italian Space Agency and NASA. \"The mission has changed the way we think of where life may have developed beyond our Earth,\" said Andrew Coates, head of the Planetary Science Group at Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"As well as Mars, outer planet moons like Enceladus, Europa and even Titan are now top contenders for life elsewhere,\" he added. \"We've completely rewritten the textbooks about Saturn.\" Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist, likened Cassini's mission to a marathon. \"For 13 years we have been running a marathon of scientific discovery, and we are on the last lap,\" she said early Friday. Eight of the spacecraft 12 scientific instruments were on, capturing data, in Cassini's last moments, before it disintegrates like a meteor, she said. \"We are flying more deeply into Saturn than we have ever flown before,\" she said. \"Who knows how many PhD theses might be in just those final seconds of data?\" Already, some 4,000 scientific papers have been based on data from the mission, said Mathew Owens, professor of space physics at the University of Reading. \"No doubt scientists will be analyzing the information from its final, one-way trip into Saturn's atmosphere for years to come,\" Owens said.

Cassini also carries various spectrometers and radar instruments that allowed the probe to observe features that were obstructed, such as the surface of Saturn's moon Titan, which was otherwise hidden underneath the clouds. 635: The amount of data, in gigabytes, that Cassini has collected. The complex scientific data Cassini has sent back to mission scientists on Earth includes electromagnetic spectrum observations, information on dust particles and a collection of Saturn's plasma characteristics. 890 million : The average distance in miles between the Earth and Saturn. It translates to roughly 1.43 billion kilometers. 83 : Total minutes it will take the light from Saturn to reach Earth during the end of Cassini's mission. Since the speed of light is quite fast, it is used to measure the distances of faraway objects, such as stars and galaxies. The distance between Earth and Saturn can change, depending on where the planets are in their respective orbits, and therefore the time for light to travel from one world to the other will also change. The numerical values describing Cassini's accomplishments show how significant the 13-year mission truly was. The numerical values describing Cassini's accomplishments show how significant the 13-year mission truly was. 294 : Final orbit count of Cassini around Saturn. 2: Number of oceans that the spacecraft discovered. Cassini found that both Titan and Enceladus are home to underground oceans. Many scientists now believe that Earth resembled Titan before life formed here and that Titan and Enceladus could be home to alien microbes. Preventing Cassini from contaminating these worlds is one key reason the spacecraft is being disintegrated on purpose, before its fuel runs out. 3 : The total number of missions that the Cassini spacecraft completed. Cassini's journey began in 1997, and it reached Saturn in 2004. It completed its first mission in four years, and in 2008, the spacecraft extended its coverage of the planet with the two-year Equinox mission. In 2010, Cassini began the mission that it ends tomorrow, the Solstice mission. 6,504 : The amount of propellant Cassini already used up in lbs., which translates to 2,950 kilograms. The probe set out with 6,565 lbs., or 2,978 kg, of fuel. This narrow gap between the numbers indicates Cassini is running low on fuel. If the probe were allowed to orbit Saturn without any way to for NASA to navigate it, Cassini would be at risk of crashing onto a Saturnian moon and disturbing that body's natural processes. 12,593 : Weight in lbs. when Cassini set off with the Huygens probe, fuel, adaptor and other instruments. That translates to 5,712 kg. 4,685 : Cassini's current weight in lbs. after using up just about all of its fuel and having released the Huygens probe onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan. 12 : The total number of scientific instruments used by Cassini to collect and send data about Saturn, its rings and its moons. Those instruments include the composite infrared spectrometer, imaging system, ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, visual and infrared mapping spectrometer, imaging radar, radio science, and plasma spectrometer.

After 13 years of gathering information about Saturn, the Cassini spacecraft has ended its mission. On September 15, 2017, Cassini plunged into Saturn's atmosphere, going out in a blaze of glory after capturing vital data about the planet for more than a decade. As a parting gift, shortly before ending its mission, Cassini took 80 wide- angle photographs of Saturn over the course of two hours. Forty-two of those were stitched together as the final image from the space probe. Red, green, and blue spectral filters were combined to create a natural-color view of Saturn. Faintly in the background-and annotated in a separate image by NASA-six of Saturn's 62 moons appear. Over the course of its mission, Cassini has provided incredibly detailed photographs of Saturn's rings and moons. \"Cassini-Huygens has been nothing short of a discovery machine, captivating us with data and images never before obtained with such detail and clarity,\" states NASA. \"Cassini taught us that Saturn is a far cry from a tranquil lone planet with delicate rings. Now, we know more about Saturn's chaotic, active, and powerful rings, and the storms that rage beneath.\" Since 2004, Cassini captured almost 500,000 images from within Saturn's system, providing inspiration for scientists, artists, and the public at large. For the imaging team that wades through the material looking for the best images, creating this final image was a bittersweet moment. \"It was all too easy to get used to receiving new images from the Saturn system on a daily basis, seeing new sights, watching things change,\" said Elizabeth Turtle, an imaging team associate at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \"It was hard to say goodbye, but how lucky we were to be able to see it all through Cassini's eyes!\" To celebrate the mission, NASA has a free eBook about Cassini and its discoveries available for Kindle, PDF download, as well as other eBook readers.
