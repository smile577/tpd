                "content": "NASA has selected a science mission that will allow astronomers to explore, for the first time, the hidden details of some of the most extreme and exotic astronomical objects, such as stellar and supermassive black holes, neutron stars and pulsars. Objects such as black holes can heat surrounding gases to more than a million degrees. The high-energy X-ray radiation from this gas can be polarized - vibrating in a particular direction. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission will fly three space telescopes with cameras capable of measuring the polarization of these cosmic X-rays, allowing scientists to answer fundamental questions about these turbulent and extreme environments where gravitational, electric and magnetic fields are at their limits. \"We cannot directly image what's going on near objects like black holes and neutron stars, but studying the polarization of X-rays emitted from their surrounding environments reveals the physics of these enigmatic objects,\" said Paul Hertz, astrophysics division director for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"NASA has a great history of launching observatories in the Astrophysics Explorers Program with new and unique observational capabilities. IXPE will open a new window on the universe for astronomers to peer through. Today, we can only guess what we will find.\" NASA's Astrophysics Explorers Program requested proposals for new missions in September 2014. Fourteen proposals were submitted, and three mission concepts were selected for additional review by a panel of agency and external scientists. NASA determined the IXPE proposal provided the best science potential and most feasible development plan. The mission, slated for launch in 2020, will cost $188 million. This figure includes the cost of the launch vehicle and post-launch operations and data analysis. Principal Investigator Martin Weisskopf of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, will lead the mission. Ball Aerospace in Broomfield, Colorado, will provide the spacecraft and mission integration. The Italian Space Agency will contribute the polarization sensitive X-ray detectors, which were developed in Italy. NASA's Explorers Program provides frequent, low-cost access to space using principal investigator-led space science investigations relevant to the agency's astrophysics and heliophysics programs. The program has launched more than 90 missions, including Explorer 1 in 1958, which discovered the Van Allen radiation belts around the Earth, and the Cosmic Background Explorer mission, which led to a Nobel Prize. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the Explorers Program for the agency's Science Mission Directorate. ",

                "content": "Neutron stars, black holes, and other remnants of stellar explosions are some of the universe's most intriguing objects - and some of the hardest to study. But when NASA's newest Explorers Program mission, IXPE, launches, we'll see them like never before. Stellar remnants such as black holes and neutron stars are difficult to see. Because of their tiny size and oftentimes obscuring disks of dust and gas, direct measurements of these objects have long eluded astronomers. However, such extreme objects heat their environments to millions of degrees, which causes high-energy emission in the form of easily-observable X-rays. Studying these X-rays provides a window into the world around otherwise impossible-to-see phenomena. Now, NASA plans to delve deeper into black hole and neutron star X-ray emission with the newest addition to its Explorers Program mission lineup: the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Led by Principal Investigator Martin Weisskopf at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, IXPE will include three space telescopes capable of measuring the polarization of X-rays coming from the environments around objects such as neutron stars, pulsars, and black holes. Polarization is a property of light, including X-rays, that describes the direction in which the electromagnetic wave \"points.\" Although not recorded by most conventional instruments, polarization offers unique information about the source of the observed light, including geometry, magnetic field, and emission mechanism. Measuring the polarization of X-rays emitted in the environments of neutron stars and black holes can thus help astronomers characterize the magnetic fields of these objects, as well as the structure and geometry of the accretion disks and jets that form around them. This information will provide yet more pieces to the puzzle of how these amazing objects look and behave. NASA's Explorers Program provides selected mission proposals with the opportunity and funding to perform science from space. Unlike major space-borne observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, Explorers missions are small- or medium-sized projects characterized by more moderate price tags and a shorter timeframe between concept and launch. Some of the program's current ongoing missions include the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer (Swift). IXPE will be joining upcoming Explorers missions that include the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON), projected to launch in June of 2017, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), with a scheduled launch date in December of 2017. According to NASA's press release, IXPE is currently set to launch in 2020 with an estimated total cost - including the mission's launch vehicle and post-launch operations and data analysis - of $188 million. By comparison, NASA's flagship X-ray telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, cost $1.65 billion in development alone and another $350 million simply to launch. ",

                "content": "Sometimes, the best telescopes on Earth need a little help making their observations more meaningful. NASA announced yesterday that it had decided to fund the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE, pronounced ix-pee) mission, a polarised X-ray telescope, to help the bigger telescopes explore some of space's strangest phenomena - including the dead remains of exploded stars and galactic lighthouses called pulsars. NASA already has some stellar X-ray telescopes, most notably the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The IXPE, however, is special in that it measures polarised X-rays. Light rays are usually unpolarised, meaning the vibrations of the waves happen in many different directions. Polarisation realigns the vibrations in a specific direction or set of directions - for instance, up-and-down or in a circle. No other NASA telescope can analyse these specific organised rays, Paul Hertz, Director of the Astrophysics Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA, told Gizmodo. IXPE isn't going to produce hyper-crisp images like Chandra does. \"It's much blurrier,\" said Hertz. Instead, IXPE will add specific details that Chandra can't see around some of the weirdest objects in space. The telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2020, is much cheaper, priced at a comparatively budget $US188 million ($257 million), compared to the billions that funded Chandra. Its funding comes from the Explorers program, which is kind of like NASA Shark Tank, allowing scientists to apply for NASA funding and resources for smaller space-based science missions. Because of the IXPE mission's smaller size, Hertz thinks of it as a trial-run to see how much value polarised X-rays have to offer. \"If astronomers decide it's critical information,\" said Hertz, \"you can imagine putting an instrument like this on a Chandra follow-up.\" ",

Lucy, a robotic spacecraft, is scheduled to launch in October 2021 and will visit a target-rich environment of Jupiter\u2019s mysterious Trojan asteroids. The Trojans, currently trapped by Jupiter's gravity, may have initially formed far from beyond the gas giants current orbit and by studying six of these objects from 2027 to 2033, Lucy will hopefully shed light on a much earlier period in the history of the solar system.",

Slated to launch in 2020, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission will help explore some of the most turbulent and extreme environments in our universe -- from the hottest, messiest star factories to violent jets screaming away from monster black holes, the US space agency said. \"NASA welcomes the opportunity to work with ASI (Italian Space Agency) on this mission, to build upon a history of strong cooperation between our agencies in the space sciences,\" said NASA's Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot. \"We wish all those working on IXPE great success in the years ahead, and we eagerly anticipate the scientific promise of this exciting space science mission,\" Lightfoot, who signed the agreement with ASI President Roberto Battiston on Tuesday, said. The IXPE mission will fly three telescope systems capable of measuring the polarisation of X-rays emitted by cosmic sources. \"With this agreement Italy confirms to play a leading role in the scientific field of high energy studies,\" Battiston said. ASI will contribute to IXPE's sophisticated \"eyes\" -- three polarisation-sensitive X-ray detectors which were developed in Italy -- and the use of its equatorial ground station located at Malindi, Kenya. NASA will supply the X-ray telescopes and use of its facilities to perform end-to-end X-ray calibration and science operations, as per the agreement.",

                "date": "2019-07-08",
                "content": "NASA has selected a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket - flying with a reused first stage booster - to launch the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer mission from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in April 2021, bypassing Northrop Grumman's air-launched Pegasus rocket for the task. The $50.3 million contract with SpaceX announced Monday covers \"the launch service and other mission-related costs,\" NASA said in a press release. The value of the IXPE launch contract is one of the most concrete examples of SpaceX's progress in reducing launch costs by recovering and reusing first stage boosters. NASA awarded its most recent launch contract with SpaceX in April, selecting a Falcon 9 rocket to loft the agency's Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in mid-2021. A NASA spokesperson said that contract, valued at $69 million, has provisions for SpaceX to build a new first stage booster. NASA's Launch Services Program, which oversees procurement of launch vehicles for NASA's research satellites, has awarded SpaceX contracts for six missions to date. Before DART, the last mission awarded to SpaceX was for the launch of the Sentinel 6A ocean altimetry mission in November 2020 from California. That contract, announced in October 2017, was valued at $97 million. The launch contract for the IXPE mission announced Monday permits SpaceX to use a previously-flown first stage, according Tracy Young, a NASA spokesperson. The terms of commercial launch contracts are often not publicly released, but satellite operators have said they received financial discounts from SpaceX when launching their payloads on previously-flown boosters. SpaceX typically charges more to U.S. government customers, such as NASA or the U.S. Air Force, because of the government's oversight and mission assurance requirements. \"SpaceX is honored that NASA continues to place its trust in our proven launch vehicles to deliver important science payloads to orbit,\" said Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's president and chief operating officer. \"IXPE will serve as SpaceX's sixth contracted mission under NASA's LSP, two of which were successfully launched in 2016 and 2018, increasing the agency's scientific observational capabilities.\" During the mission's preliminary design phase, engineers assumed IXPE would launch on Northrop Grumman's air-dropped Pegasus XL rocket. The IXPE spacecraft, built by Ball Aerospace, was designed to fit inside the Pegasus rocket's payload fairing envelope, and will weigh about 660 pounds (300 kilograms) at the time of launch. IXPE is designed to fly in an unusual 335-mile-high (540-kilometer) equatorial orbit, at an inclination of 0 degrees, to minimize the X-ray instrument's exposure to radiation in the South Atlantic Anomaly, the region where the inner Van Allen radiation belt comes closest to Earth's surface. The air-launched Pegasus XL rocket could have sent the IXPE spacecraft into such an orbit from a position over the Pacific Ocean near Kwajalein Atoll, the remote staging point for four previous Pegasus missions. The only firm mission in Northrop Grumman's Pegasus backlog is the launch of NASA's Ionospheric Connection Explorer, or ICON, spacecraft. ICON was supposed to launch in 2017, but a series of problems with its Pegasus rocket have kept the mission grounded. The earliest possible launch date for ICON is now likely no earlier than September, according to NASA and industry officials. NASA's launch contract for the ICON mission was valued at $56.3 million when the agency announced the agreement in 2014. NASA last month selected a pair of heliophysics missions to become the next Small Explorer mission after IXPE. Four satellites comprising the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, or PUNCH, mission will launch on the same rocket as two satellites that make up the Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites, or TRACERS, mission. The PUNCH mission was originally designed to fly on a Pegasus rocket, but after NASA's decision to launch PUNCH in tandem with TRACERS, officials are expected to select a different launcher. IXPE passed its critical design review - the point at which a spacecraft's design is frozen - last year, and engineers proceeded into full-scale manufacturing of the satellite and its X-ray telescope payload. NASA selected IXPE to become the next in the agency's line of Small Explorer missions in January 2017. At the time, NASA said the IXPE mission would cost $188 million, covering development of the spacecraft and its X-ray telescope payload, a launch vehicle, and two years of operations. After launch, the IXPE spacecraft will extend a 13-foot (4-meter) boom holding three X-ray mirror modules to direct X-ray light onto a set of three detectors housed in the main body of the satellite. The Italian Space Agency, ASI, is providing the X-ray detectors and a ground station for the IXPE mission. IXPE will measure the polarization of high-energy cosmic X-rays, collecting data that will allow astronomers to study the unseen environment around black holes, neutron stars and pulsars, the extremely dense collapsed remains left behind by exploding stars. Astronomers hope IXPE will reveal the spin of black holes, and yield new discoveries about the extreme magnetic fields around a special type of neutron star called magnetars. ",

                "content": "NASA's award to SpaceX for the launch contract for their future X-ray telescope, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), points to SpaceX's growing launch profile options for customers. This spacecraft would normally be a Pegasus mission due to its orbital requirements. However, SpaceX offered the capability via Falcon 9 and at a lower cost. IXPE - to be built by Ball Aerospace, who recently completed the spacecraft's design review - is slated to launch on a Falcon 9 from LC-39A in April 2021. Falcon 9 Capability: The growing range of rockets available for NASA spacecraft has allowed the agency to shop around. This particular spacecraft requires a launch to a Low Altitude Equatorial Orbit with zero degrees inclination, which - as experts such as Scott Manley point out - is normally the role provided by an air-launch system, such as NASA's usual go-to launch vehicle, the NGIS Pegasus. As noted, SpaceX has shown Falcon 9's can provide the post-flight orbit capability, which Manley predicts will be about 3.7 kms per second Delta-v. IXPE History IXPE's selection was announced by NASA on January 3, 2017, as part of the agency's Explorers program - a low-cost set of scientific missions. It will have a 2-year primary mission - which may be extended, pending IXPE's performance. IXPE will contain 3 X-ray telescopes to measure the polarization of X-rays. This will allow scientists to conduct further research into the universe's strangest objects, including black holes, pulsars, and neutron stars. The telescopes will have a 2-8 keV range, an 11-arcminute field of view, and \u226430-arcsecond angular resolution. IXPE's detectors will be two orders of magnitude more sensitive than those on the Orbiting Solar Observatory. IXPE will be NASA's newest X-ray telescope - its first since NICER, which launched to the International Space Station on the CRS-11 Dragon in June 2017. X-ray astronomy offers a unique perspective on the universe that is unattainable through other methods. This type of astronomy is useful for imaging extremely hot objects in space, which begin to emit X-rays around temperatures of 1 million Kelvin. These objects include the centers of galaxies, supernova remnants, neutron stars, and black holes. Since Earth's atmosphere blocks almost all extraterrestrial X-rays from reaching the surface, X-ray astronomy is only possible with space telescopes. IXPE will study a specific area of X-ray astronomy, called X-ray Polarization. Studying polarization will allow scientists to observe matter distribution, the spin of black holes, and more. IXPE will be built by Ball Aerospace, who is no stranger to building spacecraft. Their past experience includes building the Kepler space telescope, portions of the Hubble, Spitzer, and James Webb space telescopes, and the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). On July 10, 2019, Ball announced that they had completed the Critical Design Review (CDR) for IXPE. A CDR is a detailed analysis of all parts of a mission. It ensures that the spacecraft design is acceptable and within the budget constraints for the mission. Once a spacecraft passes its CDR, major production, assembly, and testing can begin for the spacecraft. Two days earlier, on July 8, NASA announced that SpaceX had been awarded the launch contract for IXPE. It will be launched on a Falcon 9 to a 540km circular equatorial orbit. The launch will take place from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center in April 2021. In the original proposal, IXPE was to launch on a Pegasus rocket from Kwajalein sometime around November 2020. However, this was likely switched to a Falcon 9 due to the substantial delays of the Pegasus that will launch the ICON spacecraft. ICON was planned to launch in late 2017, but that date has been pushed back multiple times due to issues with its Pegasus rocket. Since IXPE was designed to launch on Pegasus, it had to fit within the rocket's small fairing. Because of this, it will launch in a compact configuration. Once it separates from the Falcon 9 second stage, it will deploy its solar panels, payload boom, and X-ray shield. In addition to having fewer delays, the Falcon 9 also offers a very low launch price for its capabilities. The total launch costs for the mission are only $50.3 million - lower than the SpaceX's advertised price of $62 million. This lower number indicates that the vehicle will likely include a flight-proven first stage. Compared to Falcon 9's regular payloads, IXPE is very small. Weighing in at approximately 320kg, it will make for an easy mission for the workhorse rocket. Due to its low mass and orbit, this mission could likely feature a Return-to-Launch-Site (RTLS) landing of the first stage at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1. However, this depends on both the flight profile and how much extra performance margin NASA requests. Currently, SpaceX has 13 missions planned for 2021 - including IXPE. This number excludes potential ISS commercial resupply, crew transportation, and Starlink missions. Should the current schedules hold, IXPE will be SpaceX's seventh NASA spacecraft launch.",

The TAI team just finished assembly and testing on these units, designed and manufactured for Ball Aerospace, and will be supplying several dozen more flight model (FM) units to Ball in the coming months, in addition to the prototype and FM units delivered to the Italy's Space Agency (ASI) and the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), for their part on the IXPE Mission. The straps are used by both Ball and INFN to provide a durable, highly-conductive thermal strap solution weighing in at just 1/10th the mass of an equivalent copper thermal strap, and are used to cool various components on IXPE (the X-ray polarization detectors provided by INFN use a TEC-GFTS hybrid thermal strap design highlighted in previous blogs).",

                "title": "Coronavirus work stoppage likely to delay launch of NASA X-ray astronomy mission",
                "date": "2020-07-02",
                "content": "A nearly three-month stoppage of on-site work due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus at NASA's Marshall Space Fight Center in Alabama is expected to push back the launch of the IXPE X-ray astronomy satellite from May 2021 until some time later next year, a senior space agency official said. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, or IXPE, mission is assigned to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. IXPE is designed to measure the polarization of high-energy cosmic X-rays, collecting data that will allow astronomers to study the unseen environment around black holes, neutron stars and pulsars, the extremely dense collapsed remains left behind by exploding stars. Astronomers hope IXPE will reveal the spin of black holes, and yield new discoveries about the extreme magnetic fields around a special type of neutron star called magnetars. In order to obtain the sensitivity required for the X-ray research, the IXPE observatory will host three identical X-ray telescopes that will be extended after launch on a 13-foot (4-meter) boom. Built at Marshall Space Flight Center, the mirror module assemblies at the end of the boom will focus X-rays onto detectors provided by ASI, the Italian space agency. Paul Hertz, head of NASA's astrophysics division, said June 23 that work on assembling the mirrors at Marshall was delayed after the space center in Huntsville, Alabama, was closed to all non-essential personnel in March amid escalating numbers of coronavirus cases in the area. After developing new safety protocols, teams resume in-person work on the mirrors in late May, Hertz said in a presentation to NASA's Astrophysics Advisory Committee. Hertz said IXPE was \"probably the most seriously impacted\" by the coronavirus pandemic of all of NASA's Explorer-class missions, a set of small-to-medium size scientific spacecraft designed to pursue questions in astrophysics and solar physics. \"The reason is COVID hit right when we were integrating the mirrors down at the Marshall Space Flight Center, and that is the critical path,\" Hertz said. \"So when Marshall shut down for three months, nothing happened on the critical path for three months.\" Some work on IXPE has continued, Hertz said. Ball Aerospace in Boulder, Colorado, kept working on the IXPE spacecraft bus, which will host the X-ray mirrors and detectors. And Italian scientists providing the mission's X-ray detectors finished their work and prepared them for shipment to the United States, once international travel restrictions allow Italian team members to accompany the hardware to help integrate it into the spacecraft. \"The collective safety of our IXPE team continues to be the number one priority,\" said Molly Porter, a NASA spokesperson. \"We're slowly and methodically resuming mission-critical work that cannot be done off site. This includes several tasks for the in-house production of IXPE's mirror modules at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. \"We are still assessing COVID-19's impacts to cost and schedule,\" Porter said. The team at Marshall will assemble, calibrate and test the mirrors before shipping the flight units to Ball Aerospace for integration on the spacecraft, Hertz said. NASA also anticipates a budget impact to the IXPE mission from the delay. \"So IXPE did have a three-month delay,\" Hertz said. \"This happened right at the peak burn rate for IXPE, and we would have completed work and rolled staff off, but the work didn't complete, so we didn't roll staff. So not only was it a schedule hit, it was also a budget hit.\" NASA selected IXPE to become the next in the agency's line of Small Explorer missions in January 2017. At the time, NASA said the IXPE mission would cost $188 million, covering development of the spacecraft and its X-ray telescope payload, a launch vehicle, and two years of operations. NASA last year signed a $50.3 million contract with SpaceX to launch the IXPE satellite on a previously-flown Falcon 9 booster from the Kennedy Space Center. According to Porter, IXPE is currently predicted to weigh around 743 pounds (337 kilograms) at launch, and will deploy off the Falcon 9 rocket into an unusual 335-mile-high (540-kilometer) equatorial orbit with an inclination of 0.2 degrees. The orbit hugging the equator will minimize the X-ray instrument's exposure to radiation in the South Atlantic Anomaly, the region where the inner Van Allen radiation belt comes closest to Earth's surface. \"I think that certainly IXPE was the most impacted (of NASA's Explorer missions) because of the timing of when work stopped,\" Hertz said. \"They were at the worst time for us to stop work of all of our small missions.\" NASA's other Explorer-class missions being prepared for launch have experienced fewer impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. GUSTO, a high-altitude balloon-borne infrared telescope to study the interstellar medium, remains on track for launch from Antarctica in December 2021. NASA's SPHEREx satellite is scheduled for launch in 2024 on a mission to survey galaxies and search for clues about the formation of ices that could seed life on planets. Hertz said two major subcontractors working on the SPHEREx mission could not start work on schedule due to the coronavirus pandemic. That caused some delays, but the SPHEREx mission is still relatively early in development, not in the peak phase of assembly and testing like IXPE. It is too early to know how the coronavirus-related delays might affect NASA's budget for astrophysics missions, Hertz said. \"We don't actually know what the final impact will be because we don't know what the trajectory is for the country and all of our industry partners and academic partners for recovering from the pandemic and getting back to work,\" Hertz said. \"So for some missions, it's easy to see like IXPE because there's a single path right now as we're integrating it up. \"For the Explorers, we'll be able to handle the impacts within the resources that I think we have within the program,\" he said. Hertz said he believes NASA's budget for the James Webb Space Telescope, which has cost more to develop than any space science mission in history, also has \"adequate\" funding reserves \"to encompass all possible predictions of what the COVID impact is.\" \"I hope that doesn't come back to bite me, but right now it does look like we have in place appropriate reserves on Webb,\" Hertz said. NASA established a new budget for Webb in 2018 that covered an expected development cost of $8.8 billion. That does not include international contributions or operating costs after the observatory's launch. Like IXPE, Webb experienced a slowdown in work due to the coronavirus. Teams worked at about 40 percent efficiency for several months, but starting staffing at higher levels in June to prepare for a series of key ground tests later this year. Webb's launch is expected to be delayed from its previous target of March 30, 2021, but NASA has not yet released an updated schedule. More than half of the this year's budget for NASA's astrophysics program goes toward the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, formerly known as WFIRST. Those are NASA's next two \"great observatories.\" The Roman telescope is scheduled for launch in 2025. \"On Roman, I'm just unsure of what the impact (from COVID-19) will be because Roman is doing fine today, but there's some work that's not getting done today, so it's being deferred into the future,\" Hertz said. \"But that work is funded. So whether we're just redistributing the work and the money, and it's not really a cost growth, or whether there's inefficiencies that amount to something substantial on Roman, I think it's too early for us to tell.\"",

                "content": "The launch of a NASA astronomy smallsat mission next year will be postponed by several months after the pandemic delayed assembly of key elements of the spacecraft. NASA had planned to launch the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) spacecraft in May 2021 on a SpaceX Falcon 9. The spacecraft, selected in 2017 as part of the Explorers program of small astrophysics missions, will go into an equatorial orbit to measure the polarization of X-rays to help astronomers better understand neutron stars, pulsars and black holes. However, work on IXPE was affected by the pandemic. That included completion of X-ray detectors and their shipment from Italy to the United States, as well as work on the X-ray mirror modules at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. That center went to level 4 of NASA's pandemic response plan, limiting access to just mission-essential personnel, in March, and work on IXPE resumed there in June. \"It was strongly impacted by COVID when we had a three-month stop-work [order] at Marshall,\" Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics mission, said of IXPE at an advisory committee meeting in June. At the time the project was evaluating the impact on the launch date but had not yet made a decision on delaying it. In a talk at the 34th Annual Conference on Small Satellites, Bill Deininger, chief system engineer on IXPE at Ball Aerospace, which is providing the spacecraft, said the mission was now planning a September 2021 launch for IXPE. \"Because of the times that we live in, COVID-19 has had an impact on the project,\" he acknowledged. Ball has taken on a bigger role in spacecraft assembly efforts to partially compensate for the delays, such as assuming responsibility for receiving and checking out the instruments. \"We've been able to make solid progress on the spacecraft,\" including powering on the spacecraft and loading flight software. Deininger also discussed in his presentation the decision to launch IXPE on a Falcon 9. The spacecraft was originally designed to launch on a much smaller vehicle, Northrop Grumman's Pegasus XL, but in July 2019 NASA awarded a contract to SpaceX for the launch, with a contract value for the Falcon 9 less that previous NASA awards for Pegasus launches. \"When we originally put this concept together, Pegasus was the only vehicle available for a zero-degree-inclination orbit over 500 kilometers,\" he said. The change in vehicles requires some work to adjust to the different structural, acoustical and thermal environments of the Falcon 9, he noted. However, Deininger said the use of the Falcon 9 has benefits beyond the lower cost. The Falcon will place IXPE into a slightly higher orbit, at about 600 kilometers, which will allow for a longer scientific lifetime for the mission. The far larger volume available inside the Falcon 9 payload fairing also allowed the mission to redesign X-ray shields on one end of the spacecraft, eliminating deployment mechanisms that simplify the spacecraft.",

                "content": "Despite COVID-19-related hurdles, NASA's newest X-ray astronomy mission is a step closer to launch. Engineers recently completed integration of the agency's Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer, or IXPE, at Ball Aerospace in Boulder, Colorado. Now, Ball will put the fully assembled observatory through a series of tests that simulate the harsh conditions the small spacecraft will encounter on its rocket trip into space in late 2021. \"Reaching this milestone is a testament to the experience, commitment, and expertise of the IXPE team and our partners around the world,\" said IXPE principal investigator Martin Weisskopf of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, who first conceived of the mission 30 years ago. \"We're all looking forward to providing world-class science and expanding our view of the X-ray universe.\" IXPE is the first small satellite mission dedicated to measuring the polarization of X-rays from a variety of cosmic sources - from black holes to exploded stars and jets traveling near the speed of light. IXPE's polarization measurements will complement observations from other telescopes in space now, including NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, adding new details about the nature of these mysterious objects and the environments close to them. Upon completion, the IXPE observatory will be shipped to NASA's Kennedy Space Center near Cape Canaveral, Florida, for launch from launch complex 39A on a SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle. Building IXPE during a Pandemic: A collaboration between NASA Marshall and the Italian Space Agency (ASI), IXPE consists of three identical X-ray telescopes, each containing a set of nested cylinder-shaped mirrors - known as \"grazing incidence\" mirrors - paired with a corresponding polarization-sensitive detector. IXPE's polarization measurements are made possible by new detector technology contributed by ASI. Marshall's responsibility was to build and calibrate the mirror assemblies and deliver them to Ball for assembly, integration, and environmental testing. \"As an international project, the IXPE team faced a lot of unexpected challenges in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Janice Houston, lead systems engineer at Marshall. \"To get here has really taken a lot of teamwork and working through challenges. We have learned a lot about overcoming logistical difficulties - how to ship the hardware from one place to another during lockdown and how to remotely supervise and monitor handling and testing.\" In order to keep team members safe and healthy, NASA delayed assembly and calibration of IXPE's mirror modules in mid-March, 2020. The IXPE team developed a new schedule to allow the team to reorder its assembly and testing timeline and get the spacecraft ready for launch. The mirror assemblies left Marshall the afternoon of Sept. 9, arriving at Ball on Sept. 10 to be integrated into the spacecraft. Under normal circumstances, Marshall's mirror module assembly team would help unpack and inspect the mirror modules after shipment. Instead, the team provided Ball with written procedures and video demonstrating post-shipment inspection, resulting in a successful integration. With integration complete, IXPE will undergo environmental testing at Ball. Though each component of the observatory has been rigorously tested during development, demonstrating that the assembled flight hardware is able to safely pass through a simulated launch environment will be another significant achievement for the mission. NASA has worked carefully with its international partners to match the testing environment precisely to what IXPE will experience both on launch day, and when operating in orbit.",

MST-3 verified operational procedures and performed Instrument Commissioning steps successfully. In addition, the MOC simulated download of contact telemetry files at 32kbps and 2Mbps. All test objectives were met ahead of schedule and no new Test Anomaly Reports (TARs) were recorded. The CU/LASP operations team produced the operation procedures and then successfully executed the Instrument commissioning plan from the MOC!

The inspections conducted 8/12-14/21, resulted in replacement of one thermal shield and confirmed the MMAs are ready for flight. The Astrophysics Branch prepared for the inspection by utilizing the EV74 (Allen) developed IXPE Observatory Mockup. The mockup was instrumental for defining access for thermal shield removal/installation and viewing angles for MMA inspection. ST12 conducted a detailed visual and photographic inspection of the MMA mirror shell alignment, doubler bond joints, shell bond joints, and rear comb condition. No discrepancies were identified. Detailed inspection of the thermal shields identified one previous discrepancy had not worsened, and one new discrepancy, a small tear in the thermal shield film.

                "content": "The launch of the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer observatory is now targeting December 13, 2021, onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The IXPE X-Ray observatory is the latest spacecraft in NASA's historic Small Explorers program. The IXPE mission was first selected as a part of the Explorers program in January 2017. NASA awarded the IXPE team $188 million for the spacecraft and mission, including the cost of the launch vehicle, post-launch operations, and data analysis. The spacecraft will be used to study Black Holes and other cosmic X-ray mysteries. Built by Ball Aerospace at facilities in Boulder, Colorado, the IXPE spacecraft is based on the Ball Configurable Platform -100 satellite bus. The BCP-100 is one of Ball Aerospace's offerings for a modular satellite bus for low-Earth orbit operations. It was most recently used by NASA's Green Propellant Infusion Mission to test a new type of Green propellant for space operations. IXPE is not the only space observatory Ball Aerospace has built. Ball built the Kepler space telescope, instruments for the Hubble and Spitzer space telescope. Ball also made the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, now named Near-Earth Orbit WISE, which is also a part of the Explorers program. Using the BCP-100 satellite bus, IXPE will weigh a total of ~325kg. When launched, the spacecraft will be 1.1 meters in diameter and 5.2 meters tall when the spacecraft is fully extended. The solar array will be 2.7 meters when fully deployed. IXPE will have a two-year primary mission while in orbit. The IXPE spacecraft is separated into two different parts. The first is the main spacecraft with the solar array, attitude control, and communication systems. The second part is attached with a deployable payload boom with its X-Ray shield and main Mirror Module Support Structure deck. The MMSS will consist of three separate mirror-based telescopes, all with a focal length of four meters. The focal length will be achieved by the deployable boom. The telescopes will focus X-rays seen from space onto a polarization-sensitive imaging detector developed in Italy. The telescopes will have a 2-8 keV range, an 11-arcminute field of view, and <=30-arcsecond angular resolution. IXPE's detectors will be two orders of magnitude more sensitive than those on the Orbiting Solar Observatory -8 mission. Using these three telescopes, IXPE will study X-ray Polarization. X-Ray Polarization is a specific area of X-Ray astronomy that allows scientists to study matter distribution, the spin of black holes, and more. IXPE is the first of its kind to study polarized X-Rays from extreme objects like neutron stars, stellar and supermassive black holes. IXPE completed its Critical Design Review in July 2019. From there, the spacecraft underwent construction and assembly. In September 2020, the Mirror Module Assembly was delivered to Ball Aerospace in Boulder. A month later, the MMA was installed on the MMSS deck. In December 2020, the extendable boom arm underwent a deployment test. By the end of January 2021, the spacecraft was completed and began environmental testing. In August 2021, IXPE completed a 21-day thermal vacuum test with its boom extended. By the end of August, the arm was stowed and was back in its cleanroom. Next up for IXPE is the completion of all of its pre-launch testing. Soon it will be delivered from Ball's facilities in Boulder to Kennedy Space Center in Florida for its launch. IXPE is currently set to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9, likely from historic Launch Complex 39A. In 2019 NASA awarded SpaceX $50.3 million to launch IXPE. IXPE was originally designed to be launched on an air-launched Northrop Grumman Pegasus-XL launch vehicle, but SpaceX ended up winning the contract to launch IXPE. Originally targeting May 2021, it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic to late-2021. The launch is currently scheduled for no earlier than on December 13, 2021. The Falcon 9 will launch IXPE in a circular 590km orbit by 0.2 degrees inclination. Also, given IXPE's size and weight, it may conduct a Return-To- Launch Site landing at SpaceX's Cape Canaveral Landing Zone-1. Once separated from the Falcon 9, it will extend its solar array and payload boom to begin its mission. Explorers Program: IXPE is the latest in a very long list of satellites in the Explorers program. The Explorers program started in the 1950s as a US Army program to launch the first artificial satellite to orbit. The first US satellite, Explorer-1, was launched via a Juno-1 rocket in January 1958, before the program was taken over by NASA when it was founded in October 1958. Over time the program evolved to what it is today. The program is now separated into three main different classes and one minor class. There is a Medium-Class Explorers, the SMEX, the University-Class Explorers, and Mission of Opportunity. Some of the active MO missions include the Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral-Atom Astrometers, which is a pair of instruments on the USA-184 and the USA-200 missions. Another mission is the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer X-Ray telescope which was launched on the SpaceX CRS-11 mission to the International Space Station. The most recent mission to fly is the Global-scale Observation of the Limb and Disk mission currently onboard the Airbus-built SES-14 spacecraft. The ACE spacecraft, which has currently been in operation for about 24 years, is one of the longest operating NASA missions ever. ACE is currently being used to study particles and magnetic fields in space. Today, along with NOAA's DSCOVR spacecraft, it is currently being used to observe space weather and be used as early detection for solar activity. ACE will remain in operation until 2024, when it will run out of fuel. THEMIS is a mission comprised of five spacecraft, of which three are in highly-elliptical Earth orbit and two in a Lunar orbit. The two in Lunar orbit were renamed ARTEMIS P1 and P2. THEMIS and ARTEMIS are both working in tangent with each other and other spacecraft to help study the Sun and its effect on the Earth's magnetosphere. Their mission will continue until all spacecraft run out of fuel. NEOWISE is currently in a Sun-synchronous orbit on a mission to detect Near- Earth objects. In July 2021, its mission was extended until June 2023. A future spacecraft, NEO Surveyor, will replace NEOWISE when it launches in 2026. It is currently in Phase B of program development. The Explorers program allows opportunities for heliophysics and astrophysics science areas. The program still has several more missions coming up for future missions. The next SMEX missions following IXPE are the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere and the Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites missions. Both will launch together on an unassigned launch vehicle in October 2023. The two are currently in Phase B and are undergoing design and technology completion. In 2024, several more Explorer missions will launch, including the Spectro- Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ice Explorer, as well as the Sun Radio Interferometer Space Experiment mission. SPHEREx is currently in Phase C, which means it is now in Final Design and Fabrication; it will launch in September 2024 on a Falcon 9 from Vandenberg Space Force Base. SunRISE just entered Phase B of its development in September 2021. The six spacecraft will launch onboard a Maxar-built satellite to geostationary orbit, currently planned for some time between April 2024 and September 2025. ",

The Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer, or IXPE, will scientists use X-rays to watch the black holes, quasars and supernovas. Astronomer Michelle Thaller with NASA's Goddard House Flight Center in Maryland says, \"With X-rays, you see things that are the most violent dynamic things in the universe,\" and In order to naturally emit an X-ray in space, the gas must be in the millions of degrees.\" Thaller says that there are some reasons why observing deep space is important. IXPE uses 3 telescopes outfitter with what is primarily polarized sunglasses to watch X-rays in the distant reaches of space. Thaller says a satellite is required because of Earth's atmosphere prevents X-rays from reaching us. \"X-ray polarimetry is really the way that you simply can visualize magnetic fields, magnetic fields change the way light behaves.\" Magnetic fields surround supernovas, black holes and quasars. \"These are big black holes, black holes that are billions of times the mass of the Sun, and there are so many intense magnetic fields.\" Thaller says that NASA hopes that IXPE will continue its mission for another decade. Later this month, NASA will launch the James Webb Space Telescope. This telescope will be able to view distant galaxies and even the atmospheres of distant planets.

                "content": "The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer or IXPE observatory is the new X-ray telescope that NASA has launched to study the most powerful cosmic objects. The IXPE telescope was launched on December 9 and has been designed to detect a certain characteristic of light known as 'polarisation'. According to NASA, polarisation is the characteristic of light that can reveal secrets about the light beam, its source and the environment it has travelled through, thus giving us clues about the hidden corners of our universe. In order to understand the IXPE telescope's significance, let us take a look at the powerful cosmic objects it will explore during its active years. A supernova remnant: A supernova remnant is a debris cloud that is produced when stars explode during the end stage of their life. Analysing the X-rays emerging from these supernovas can help scientists understand the process a star undergoes before going supernova. With the IXPE, scientists will study the supernova remnants to map the polarization of light across it to understand how these explosions take place along with their evolution. Neutron stars: Neutron stars are other cosmic objects that are on the exploration list of the IXPE. These entities are crushed cores of stars that spin rapidly and are extremely dense. According to NASA, some neutron stars, which are also called 'magnetars', undergo powerful outbursts and have a strong and supercharged magnetic field. With IXPE's X-ray gathering ability, scientists will determine what causes the said outbursts and study the magnetic fields that drive the explosions. Black holes: The IXPE will also offer a detailed look at what happens around black holes in our galaxy. Explaining the observatory's objective regarding black holes, NASA says that matter falling toward a black hole settles into a flat disk which is extremely hot. This disk can then reflect the X-rays around it and make the light polarised before it heads towards the telescope. In addition to this, the telescope will also detail the structure and strength of magnetic fields of some jets emerging from a supersized black hole at the centre of a galaxy. Developed by NASA in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency, the IXPE has been installed 600 kilometres above Earth and will build on the work done by the Chandra Space Observatory, another X-ray telescope by NASA.

The mission, which launched on December 9, is one step closer to studying some of the most energetic and mysterious places in the universe in a new way. The IXPE observatory features three identical telescopes, each with a mirror assembly and a polarization-sensitive detector. To focus X-rays, IXPE's mirrors need to be about 13 feet away from the detectors. That's too large to fit inside some rocket fairings. So IXPE's boom had to fold up, like origami, into a 12-inch cannister and stretch out again in orbit. \"For those of us in the space game, moving parts are always frightening,\" said Martin Weisskopf, IXPE's principal investigator at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. \"Right now, I'm smiling from ear to ear.\" With the boom now deployed, mission specialists are ready to focus on commissioning the telescopes, preparing them for the spacecraft's first science.

                "date": "2022-01-10",
                "content": "The pioneering Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer telescope, the first observatory in space to perform detailed polarimetry of some of the highest- energy objects the universe has to offer, has ended its highly-successful commissioning phase just over 30 days after lifting off from the Kennedy Space Center on December 9, 2021, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. As commissioning comes to an end and project leads turn their attention to the calibration of IXPE's first-of-their-kind instruments with the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant, NASASpaceflight spoke with Principal Investigator Dr. Martin Weisskopf about the status of the mission and how the first-of-its-kind telescope will be calibrated. IXPE itself is a joint project between NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Italian Space Agency. Placed into a 600 km circular equatorial orbit inclined just 0.2 degrees to the Equator, the 330-kilogram IXPE deployed its solar arrays very shortly after separating from its launch vehicle while mission controllers prepared for the month-long commissioning phase. The spacecraft completed the most critical step of this process on December 15 when the all-important boom containing the spacecraft's three X-ray telescopes deployed successfully. Without that deployment, the IXPE mission would have ended before it could have begun as the telescopes need to be mounted away from the spacecraft's main body to achieve the correct focal length for their observations. As Dr. Weisskopf stated regarding deployment, \"For those of us in the space game, moving parts are always frightening.\" Past missions, notably the Galileo space probe mission to orbit Jupiter, have been affected by deployment failures. With the commissioning phase for IXPE ending on Monday, January 10, Dr. Weisskopf described the entire process as having \"gone incredibly smoothly,\" - with the only issue of note being a \"safe mode\" event triggered by an unexpected aspect solution from the dual-head star cameras, which are used for navigation and tracking. As Dr. Weisskopf explained, \"One of the things the cameras do is they set a flag if the next X aspect solution, which occurs every second, is not the same as the expected one. And if that happens six times in a row, it sets another flag. And that other flag should not be tripped to go into safe mode. It's just for information, but in this software, it was tripped on.\" A software update to avoid this issue has been implemented. Otherwise, commissioning went very well, with only occasional minor tweaks to procedures written before the launch - which is quite common. With commissioning complete, IXPE now must be calibrated. To do that, the telescope's first observation will be of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A beginning on Monday, January 10 - once commissioning ends. Coincidentally, Cassiopeia A was also the Chandra X-ray Observatory's first target, and Dr. Weisskopf works on both projects. The IXPE observations of Cassiopeia A are scheduled to last 21 days, with only minor interruptions of a few minutes every orbit due to the observatory's passage near the South Atlantic Anomaly. The SAA is a region where the Van Allen radiation belts dip down to an altitude of approximately 190 km above Earth sea level, resulting in an influx of charged particles and higher radiation levels. As Dr. Weisskopf explained, \"When our detectors see the influx of charged particles from the SAA, they go crazy. We can't take data than because it would just be swamped by that signal. There's also an impact on the lifetime of the detector if we just bombarded them with X-ray particles. We just don't want to do that\". After the 21 days of planned observations of Cassiopeia A, 30 days of compilation and review will be conducted before the data is made public via the NASA HEASARC website, located here. After three months, data from observations will be archived a week after the observation is made - with IXPE planned to conduct an average of one study a week. After Cassiopeia A, other planned targets include magnetars - neutron stars with particularly intense magnetic fields - as well as black holes, galactic nuclei, quasars, pulsars, and blazars, along with targets of opportunity during the two-year primary mission. Of particular interest to Dr. Weisskopf are the forthcoming studies of the polarization of magnetars - given his uncle wrote one of the first papers on magnetar magnetic fields in the 1930s. Another particular target of note for Dr. Weisskopf is the Crab Nebula supernova remnant as he has written more papers about the nebula and its pulsar than any other object in his career. As he describes the plans for observing this famous supernova remnant, \"I want to look at the polarization as a function of the pulse phase. I tried to do that with OSO-8, but we didn't have enough photons in order to do anything but upper limits. With IXPE, we'll be able to nail this with high precision because IXPE is about 100 times more sensitive than OSO was\". The OSO-8 mission, launched in 1975, was a pioneer in observing polarized X-rays from objects, light that vibrates in a particular direction that can provide insight into the physics of an object and the environment in which it formed. Until now, other X-ray observatories such as Chandra could not detect whether X-rays were polarized. The observations IXPE will make require the spacecraft to collect a large number of photons, which is the reason certain observations, like Cassiopeia A, will take up to 21 days. As Dr. Weisskopf stated, \"We need those photons. Most of your signal is background. If it's 5% polarized, that means 95% of the flux isn't polarized.. and that's just not helping\". Although brighter extragalactic objects like quasars and blazars will be observed, IXPE won't have the sensitivity required to go deeper in time and further out in space like the Chandra X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope, and the James Webb Space Telescope can. As a Small Explorer mission, IXPE is under strict cost limits and cannot afford the larger telescopes that would have allowed this capability. The $188 million mission is made possible by the Gas Pixel Detectors made in Italy and provided by the Italian Space Agency. These detectors are the heart of the spacecraft's capabilities and use a dimethyl ether-helium gas mixture to trap photons that enter through a window made of beryllium. The Italian Space Agency also provided the primary ground station IXPE communicates with: Malindi, Kenya, on the Indian Ocean. In addition, a Finnish company assisted with GPD assembly while Nagoya University in Japan provided the thermal shields. Collaboration between NASA, the Italian Space Agency, and Colorado-based spacecraft contractor Ball Aerospace helped the mission proceed despite difficulties ranging from government furloughs to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, IXPE is one of several astronomical space missions, large and small, that will paint a more complete picture of how the universe works. Additionally, IXPE was one of two major international observatories launched in December 2021, with the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope following IXPE on December 25 on an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana. Webb successfully completed its never-before-attempted unfolding process on Saturday, January 8, with a five-and-a-half-month commissioning and cool-down phase to follow.",

The Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer launched into orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on December 9, then spent a month calibrating its instruments and adjusting to the space environment. When it was finally ready to collect data, mission controllers pointed its mirrors at a supernova called Cassiopeia A - the vibrant, gas-cloud remains of a star that exploded in the 17th century. The first image was released on Monday. The gas cloud is about 10 light-years wide. In visible light, it doesn't actually glow the stunning purple color depicted above. That's just the color NASA researchers chose to represent how powerful the X-ray light is in different parts of the cloud. In the image below, they used a wider range of colors to show the variation in X-rays. When the star exploded, its shock waves superheated gas in its vicinity and accelerated nearby particles, causing it to glow bright in X-ray light. Somewhere in the center of those gas clouds, there's a super-dense object that formed when the former star's core collapsed. It could be a black hole or a neutron star. IXPE is set to spend at least two years studying the most extreme and mysterious objects in the universe - nebulae, supernovas, neutron stars, and black holes. It's NASA's first major X-ray space telescope since the Chandra X-ray Observatory launched into orbit in 1999. That telescope's first image also captured Cassiopeia A. \"The IXPE image of Cassiopeia A is as historic as the Chandra image of the same supernova remnant,\" Martin C. Weisskopf, who leads the IXPE team at NASA, said in a press release. \"It demonstrates IXPE's potential to gain new, never-before-seen information about Cassiopeia A, which is under analysis right now.\" Unlike Chandra, IXPE focuses on polarization - the direction that waves of X-ray light are pointed as they travel through space. That information can tell scientists a lot about how the X-rays are produced and allow them to see how radiation varies across the object they're studying. In this case, it could offer new peeks at what's happening inside those gas clouds and explain why they emit such powerful X-rays. \"The IXPE image of Cassiopeia A is bellissima, and we look forward to analyzing the polarimetry data to learn even more about this supernova remnant,\" Paolo Soffitta, the Italian IXPE team leader at the National Institute of Astrophysics in Rome, said in the press release. Now the IXPE team is working on using the telescope's data to build a map of polarized X-rays across the supernova cloud. ",

                "content": "Space is starting to feel in human reach more than ever before. Now, NASA's new X-ray telescope has snapped its first image. In violent space style, the image captured an exploding star. In scientific terms, the brand new Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer showed the \"vibrant electromagnetic afterglow of a supernova explosion.\" In simple terms, the aftermath of a star's death was clicked by IXPE - an impressive feat for its first image. Remains of a star that died in 17th century. The IXPE was launched into orbit on December aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, after which it spent about a month adjusting to life in space. When scientists thought it was ready to take on space, its mirrors were pointed at a supernova called \"Cassiopeia A\" or more precisely at its remains from 17th century. The cloud of gas is about 10 light-years wide. The purple-tinged image is not actually accurate, for it doesn't let out a glow in natural conditions. NASA researchers went with purple to show the intensity of X-ray light in different parts of the cloud. In a different image, the image looks more like an X-ray and shows a more diverse collection of colours that represent dust and clouds. The remains of the star glow in X-ray light because of what it expelled during its death. In the centre of these gaseous clouds lies a super-dense object which could either be a black hole or a neutron star - something that happens usually when a star runs out of energy and collapses onto itself. The IXPE will spend next two years studying mysteries of the universe - black holes, supernovas, nebulae, and neutron stars among many. The IXPE is NASA's first X-ray telescope after 1999's Chandra X-ray observatory. What's iconic is that Chandra's first image was also of Cassiopeia A.",

                "date": "2022-02-23",
                "content": "Two NASA satellites launched late last year are operational and returning imagery - one looking back at planet Earth and another peering into the cosmos in search of new insights into the remnants of dead stars. NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, or IXPE, mission has returned data from the first of at least several dozen celestial targets mapped out for two years of primary science observations. IXPE, which launched Dec. 9 from Florida on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, started its science observations last month. On Feb. 14, NASA released the first imagery from the $214 million astronomy mission. The mission's first target was Cassiopeia A, or Cas A, a giant debris cloud surrounding a super-dense skeleton of a dead star around 11,000 light years away. Cassiopeia A formed when a star estimated to be five times more massive than the sun exploded in a violent supernova. The light from that event reached Earth around 350 years ago. The explosion shot matter from the star's interior out into space in all directions at nearly the speed of light, leaving behind the star's collapsed core. IXPE's data will help astronomers study the magnetic field around the neutron star by observing the X-ray glow from nearby gas heated by the explosion. The observatory observed Cassiopeia A for about three weeks. Cassiopeia A was the first of 33 planned science targets selected for the first year of IXPE's mission, according to Martin Weisskopf, IXPE's principal investigator from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. One composite image released by NASA combines X-ray data gathered by the Chandra X-ray Observatory with measurements from IXPE. Chandra, which launched in 1999, is much larger than IXPE and offers sharper views of distant X-ray sources. Chandra's first image was also of Cassiopeia A, NASA said, revealing a combat object at the center of the luminous cloud to be a neutron star or black hole. \"The IXPE image of Cassiopeia A is as historic as the Chandra image of the same supernova remnant,\" Weisskopf said in a statement. \"It demonstrates IXPE's potential to gain new, never-before-seen information about Cassiopeia A, which is under analysis right now.\" IXPE is sensitive to X-ray in a new way. It's the first space mission tuned to measure the polarization signal of X-ray light. Similar previous telescopes, which must be in space to detect cosmic X-rays, have imaged X-ray sources in high angular resolution, measured their spectroscopy, or chemical fingerprints, and studied the time variation of X-ray signals. \"By doing this mission, we are adding two variables to the astrophysics toolkit to understand these sources,\" Weisskopf said before IXPE's launch. \"That's the degree of polarization, and the direction associated with polarization.\" The polarization of X-ray light a measurement of the direction of its electromagnetic field, a telltale signal that can inform astrophysicists about the extreme environments around black holes and supermassive objects, including the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. IXPE's three identical telescopes can measure the energy, position, time of arrival, and polarization of each X-ray photon they collect. The spacecraft, made by Ball Aerospace, extended a boom about a week after launch in December to configure the telescopes for observations. Flying in an equatorial orbit roughly 373 miles above Earth, IXPE is a partnership between NASA and the Italian Space Agency, which provided the mission's X-ray detectors and a ground station Kenya to receive science data from the satellite when it flies overhead. IXPE will help astronomers measure the spin rate of back holes, using polarization data to determine the energy from an X-ray source. The mission will also look at the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, known as Sagittarius A*. IXPE's measurements may confirm whether the black hole was much brighter just a few hundred years ago, as some scientists believe. IXPE will also look at more distant targets, such as blazers at the centers of other galaxies. Blazars have powerful jets of radiation that happen to be aimed directly at Earth. The mission will also study the polarization of X-rays coming from magnetars, which have the strongest magnetic fields of any star, some one thousand trillion times more intense than Earth's magnetic field. The Landsat 9 remote sensing satellite, meanwhile, is now operational after several months of post-launch commissioning since its liftoff Sept. 27 from California aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket. The mission is a joint project managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey. Landsat 9 is the newest in a line of remote sensing satellites developed by NASA and USGS, providing a continuous, unbroken stream of imagery of Earth's land surfaces since 1972. \"The imagery from Landsat 9 is fantastic,\" said Del Jenstrom, Landsat 9 project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"I am incredibly proud of our joint agency and contractor team for executing a very thorough and highly successful on-orbit commissioning campaign, bringing this important mission into operational status.\" Ground teams maneuvered Landsat 9 into an orbit just below that of its predecessor, Landsat 8, to cross-calibrate the new satellite's mapping camera and infrared survey instrument. Satisfied with Landsat 9's good performance, managers announced Jan. 31 that the new spacecraft would begin regular operational imaging. Data from Landsat 9 became publicly available Feb. 10. Landsat 9 flies in a polar orbit about 438 miles above Earth, collecting visible and thermal infrared imagery used to track changes in land cover, water quality, glacier flow, and other properties of Earth's surface. The thermal infrared data from Landsat satellites - essentially measurements of heat coming from Earth's surface - provide information on irrigation and water usage. Scientists and forest managers use Landsat data to measure the impact of wildfires and chart the growth of cities, making the Landsat satellites \"something like a Swiss Army knife,\" said Jeff Masek, NASA's project scientist for the Landsat mission. One method of calibrating Landsat 9's instruments involved pointing the satellite toward the full moon, a steady source of light. The testing since Landsat 9's launch also confirmed the satellite's Thermal Infrared Sensor 2, or TIRS 2 instrument, is not afflicted with the same problems with stray light that degraded some infrared images from Landsat 8, according to NASA. Landsat 9, like Landsat 8, takes medium-resolution wide-area pictures. The two satellites working in tandem will cover all of Earth's land masses every eight days. \"The Landsat user base is eager to get another observatory that will double the frequency with which they can get this high-quality data,\" Masek said in a statement. \"This is really going to benefit research in areas like snow cover, crop monitoring and water quality.\" Landsat 9 will also work in concert with other land imaging satellites, such as the European Sentinel 2 missions, to extend the continuous global coverage of land masses since the launch of Landsat 1 in 1972. The new Landsat 9 satellite replaces Landsat 7, which is operating well beyond its design life. Landsat 7 will be moved into a different orbit, where it will wait for docking of a NASA robotic satellite servicing mission that will attempt to refuel the aging satellite later this decade. Built by Northrop Grumman, Landsat 9 is designed for a five-year operating life, but could function years longer. Landsat 8, also designed for a five- year mission, earlier this month passed the ninth anniversary since its launch. NASA said it will hand over command of Landsat 9 to USGS in May. Before then, engineers will complete work on a software update for uplink to the satellite to make its data recorders less susceptible to radiation, an issue identified during recent checkouts. As of Feb. 10, Landsat 9 had collected more than 57,000 images, and will continue producing at a rate of about 750 images per day, NASA said. Data from Landsat satellites are provided to users around the world free of charge. NASA says the Landsat archive includes more than 8 million images captured since 1972. ",

                "content": " NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer mission, a joint effort with the Italian Space Agency, has returned data that no other spacecraft has obtained before from a few extreme cosmic objects. Launched in December 2021, IXPE has detected polarized X-rays from three of its first six targets. Polarized X-rays carry unique details about where the light comes from and what it passes through. By combining these details with measurements of X-rays' energy and how they change over time, we get a fuller picture of an object and how it works. Prior to IXPE, the only cosmic object with polarized X-ray measurements was the Crab Nebula, the wreckage of a massive, exploded star whose light swept past Earth nearly 1,000 years ago. In these new observations, IXPE has confirmed the previous Crab Nebula measurements and detected X-ray polarization from a neutron star and a magnetar. A magnetar is a highly magnetic neutron star, a dense object left in the wake of a stellar explosion. Scientists are now analyzing these preliminary data to better understand what they mean and how they fit in with other observations of these objects. \"Now in its third month of science operations, IXPE is performing as anticipated and is measuring the X-ray polarization of cosmic sources in the high-energy universe,\" said Steve O'Dell, IXPE's project scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \"We are excited to see these new results, about a half-century after the pioneering work of IXPE's principal investigator Martin Weisskopf and look forward to using this new tool to understand better the workings of neutron stars, black holes, and more.\" Weisskopf was part of a team from Columbia University that first detected polarized X-rays from the Crab Nebula in 1971 using a sounding rocket experiment. About five years later, in 1976 and 1977, the Columbia team used NASA's eighth Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-8) to confirm that X-rays from the Crab Nebula are polarized by a degree of almost 20 percent. IXPE measures the polarization of X-rays with higher precision, but its preliminary results agree with observations from OSO-8 and more recent measurements taken by a small satellite called PolarLight. Another object IXPE has looked at recently is the magnetar 4U 0142+61 in the constellation Cassiopeia. The third object that IXPE detected polarized X-rays is the binary accreting neutron star system Hercules X-1, which consists of a low-mass star and a neutron star that is pulling material off it. The other targets for IXPE's first science observations were the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A and the active galaxy Centaurus A, as well as the Sagittarius A Complex at the center of the Milky Way, a region that includes the black hole Sagittarius A*. Preliminary analyses have not detected X-ray polarization from these objects so far, but more detailed analyses are underway. IXPE's first datasets are now publicly available through NASA's High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center, managed by the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.",

                "date": "2022-11-10",
                "content": "Less than a year after launching, NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer's (IXPE) observations of a neutron star have led to confirmation of what scientists have only previously theorized: magnetars have ultra-strong magnetic fields and are highly polarized. Scientists used IXPE to observe the magnetar 4U 0142+61, a neutron star located in the Cassiopeia constellation, about 13,000 light-years away from Earth. This is the first-ever observation X-ray polarization from a magnetar, a neutron star with the most powerful magnetic fields in the universe. Astronomers found that the neutron star likely has a solid surface and no atmosphere. This is the first time that scientists have been able to reliably conclude that a neutron star has a bare solid crust, a finding enabled by IXPE's X-ray polarization measurements. Polarization is a property of light that tells us about the interconnected electric and magnetic fields that make up all wavelengths of light. These fields oscillate, or vibrate, at right angles relative to the light's path of travel. When its electric fields vibrate in a single, unified direction, we say the light is polarized. Astronomers also found that polarization angle depends on the energy of particles of light, with high energy light at a polarization angle of 90 degrees compared to low energy light. \"We found that the angle of polarization swings by exactly 90 degrees, following what theoretical models would predict if the star had a solid crust surrounded by an external magnetosphere filled with electric currents,\" said Roberto Taverna of the University of Padova, lead author of the new study in the journal Science. Scientists were surprised to learn energy levels can affect polarization. \"Based on current theories for the magnetars, we expected to detect polarization, but no one predicted polarization would depend on energy, as we are seeing in this magnetar,\" said Martin Weisskopf, a NASA emeritus scientist who led the IXPE team from the mission's inception until spring 2022.",
