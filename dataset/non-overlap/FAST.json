In a remote part of Guizhou province in southern China, construction has begun on a true behemoth of engineering, the Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), an instrument that promises to transform radio astronomy. \"FAST is an awesome project,\" says Subramaniam Ananthakrishnan of the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics in Pune, India. When completed, its 500-metre diameter single dish will make it the largest and most sensitive radio telescope in the world. What's more, although FAST's dish will be fixed in its crater-like setting, a series of large motors will be able to change the shape of its reflective surface, allowing it to scan large swathes of the sky. FAST will be able to peer three times further into the universe than Arecibo. Astronomers expect it to uncover thousands of new galaxies and deep-sky objects up to 7 billion light years away. Much like the Puerto Rican landscape that is home to Arecibo, Guizhou province is pocked with dramatic karst depressions, sinkholes formed by aeons of water eating away at limestone bedrock. Using a combination of satellite imagery and aerial surveys, astronomers led by Rendong Nan of the National Astronomical Observatories (NAO) in Beijing settled on a remote 800-metre-wide karst ringed by mountains, which is far enough away from population centres to be free of radio frequency interference.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028165-300-china-starts-building-worlds-biggest-radio-telescope/"}, {"title": "China building world's biggest radio telescope", "date": "2011-06-16", "content": "Since its completion in 1963, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, with a diameter of 305 m (1,000 ft) and a collecting area of 73,000 square meters (790,000 sq ft), has been the largest single-aperture radio telescope ever constructed. But Arecibo is set to lose its title with construction now underway in Guizhou Province in southern China of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Upon its expected completion in 2016, FAST will be able to see more than three times further into space and survey the skies ten times faster than Arecibo. FAST was first proposed by China for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), which has since opted to combine the signals of thousands of smaller antennae spread over a distance of more than 3,000 km (1,864 miles), combining for a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometer (0.38 square miles). The SKA will be built in the southern hemisphere with South Africa and Australia currently vying for the right to host the project. Despite this, an international review and advisory conference on the science and technology of FAST held in Beijing in 2006 concluded FAST was feasible. In the following year funding for FAST was given the green light and the approved budget now sits at CNY700 million (approx. US$107.9 million).

Two of the pulsars, named J1859-01 and J1931-01, are 16,000 light years and 4,100 light years from Earth with rotation periods of 1.83 seconds and 0.59 seconds, respectively.

Located in a naturally deep and round karst depression in southwest China's Guizhou Province, FAST was completed in September 2016. Its receiving area is equivalent to about 30 football fields. Astronomers are able to use FAST to survey hydrogen in the Milky Way and other galaxies, detect thousands of new pulsars and study the origin and evolution of the universe. Over 2,700 pulsars have been identified since the first one was discovered by British astronomers Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish on Nov. 28, 1967.

Technical preparations have been made for FAST to search for pulsars outside the Milky Way as early as next year. FAST is believed to be the world's most sensitive radio telescope. Engineers have said it is so sensitive it could capture the signal of a cell phone being used on the moon.

The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, known as FAST, has had more precise and efficient signal receivers installed, said Liu Oufei, deputy chief engineer of the telescope's receiver and terminal systems. The upgrade includes a more advanced 19-beam receiver system to replace the current single-beam receiver, which was easier to calibrate and test when FAST was launched in 2016, he said. \"Previously, it was like having only one ear listening to the sky for cosmic signals,\" he said. \"Now we have 19 ears, which can significantly increase our efficiency and ability to detect farther and fainter signals.\" The new receiver will be at least six times more accurate than the old model, and can survey the night sky 19 times faster, drastically shortening the time needed for data collecting, he said. Before the update, it usually took around 20 days to survey the sky. Chinese scientists are also looking at setting up smaller radio telescopes around FAST to create a telescope array that has greater resolution and data accuracy, Liu said. The surrounding telescopes would consist of two to 10 radio telescopes measuring 30 or 50 meters in diameter, and resolution of the array would be about 100 times greater than now, according to proposals from the FAST observation station of the National Astronomical Observatories of China, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"We have the engineering know-how to achieve these goals, but it ultimately comes down to the scientists and their projects to determine whether new telescopes are necessary,\" Liu said. \"Everything regarding the expansion is still in its early stages and is subject to change.\" Located in a natural depression in Guizhou province, FAST consists of 4,450 triangular panels that form a receiving dish about the size of 30 soccer fields. FAST's main missions include finding and studying pulsars, which are superdense, superbright rotating remnants of massive stars that eject beams of powerful electromagnetic radiation from their poles. The beams are so bright that scientists can detect them millions of light years away, hence pulsars are called \"the lighthouse of the galaxy,\" Liu said. Pulsars can also spin at an extremely stable rate due to their incredible mass and momentum, \"like the universe's most precise clock\". Using these two traits, pulsars can be used to track time and coordinates for space navigation with unprecedented accuracy, Liu said, adding Chinese scientists are already working on real time positioning systems involving pulsars. \"Finding more pulsars is not only crucial in understanding the nature of the universe,\" he said. \"They also have profound and practical uses in greatly improving our navigation capability, both for cars traveling on roads and spacecraft flying through space.\" Since its launch, FAST has discovered 51 possible pulsars, 11 of which have been confirmed by international organizations. FAST is still in a trial operation phase, but once fully operational, it theoretically could discover some 5,000 to 7,000 pulsars a year, Liu said. Scientists first discovered pulsars in 1967. Since then, more than 2,500 have been found, most of which are in the Milky Way galaxy, according to the Max Planck Society, a nonprofit research organization based in Germany. \"Every pulsar is unique, just like our fingerprints,\" Liu said. \"FAST will play an irreplaceable role in greatly expanding our pulsar roster.\"", "url": "https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201803/27/WS5ab97e0ba3105cdcf651467a.html"}, {"title": "19-beam receiver to dramatically boost sensitivity of FAST telescope", "date": "2018-05-18", "content": "The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the world's largest, is set to become more sensitive to radio signals once installation of a new 19-beam receiver is complete.

The secrecy shrouding interstellar magnetic fields can be attributed to the lack of experimental probes. While Michael Faraday was already probing the link between magnetism and electricity with coils in the early 19th century in the basement of the Royal Institution, astronomers nowadays still cannot deploy coils light-years away. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), an international team led by Dr. LI Di from National Astronomical Observatories of Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) has obtained accurate magnetic field strength in molecular cloud L1544 - a region of the interstellar medium that seems ready to form stars. The team employed the so-called HI Narrow Self-Absorption (HINSA) technique, first conceived by LI Di and Paul Goldsmith based on Arecibo data in 2003. FAST's sensitivity facilitated a clear detection of the HINSA's Zeeman effect.
