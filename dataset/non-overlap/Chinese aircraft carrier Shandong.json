The new hull, first noted under construction in imagery captured on 10 March, is in an advanced state of assembly. IHS Jane's first noted preparations for a new vessel's assembly at the dry dock in Airbus Defence and Space imagery captured on 27 February. After the launch of a large commercial cargo vessel, the empty dry dock contained multiple support blocks used to provide a base for keel assembly. On 10 March, further imagery showed the initial stages of hull construction. At the time, the support layout suggested a hull of 150 to 170 m in length with a beam of about 30 m. The hull assembly continued through the summer. Imagery from 22 September shows a lengthened aft section and expanded bow. The hull is currently assessed to have a length of about 240 m and a beam of about 35 m. The incomplete bow suggests a length of at least 270 m for the completed hull. Given the incomplete nature of the upper decks, definitive identification of the Dalian hull as the first so-called '001A' aircraft carrier is not possible.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150930023447/http://www.janes.com/article/54833/china-may-be-building-first-indigenous-carrier"}, {"title": "China's First Domestic Aircraft Carrier Almost Certainly Under Construction", "date": "2015-09-30", "content": "China has quietly begun construction on its first domestic aircraft carrier in the same northern Chinese shipyard that refurbished the People's Liberation Army Navy's current Soviet-era carrier, USNI News has learned. Several sources confirmed to USNI News that an unknown shipbuilding project - first noticed publically by Jane's in late February - is almost without a doubt the bones of the PLAN's first domestically-built carrier. Sources pointed USNI News to an April photograph that emerged on the Chinese language Internet of a ship under construction at the Dalian yard believed to be the super structure of the PLAN's second carrier. Further late September satellite photographs published by Jane's last week show a ship that corresponds to the dimensions of the refurbished Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier Liaoning - a ship with a beam of about 115 feet and a length of 886 feet. Jane's stopped short of a definitive determination that the mystery ship at Dalian was a new carrier - the Type 001A - but did compare the construction methodology of the ship to Soviet-era builds on the original Kuznetsov in the 1980s. The interest to what is in the Dalian dry dock - once the home for Liaoning's refit after China purchased the carrier - has been a hot topic of conversation for international naval watchers. One, retired U.S. Navy Capt. Chris Carlson, told USNI News given how quickly the Dalian yard builds commercial ships the timing of construction pointed toward a military platform. \"We're talking eight months from March when they say the initial sections began going up,\" he said on Wednesday. \"If it was commercial ship it would be done already.\" Carlson said the Jane's photographs indicate the ship is being built without a well deck which would likely rule out a big deck amphibious warship. \"The logical explanation is that it's a carrier,\" he said.", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2015/09/30/chinas-first-domestic-aircraft-carrier-almost-certainly-under-construction"}, {"title": "China moving full speed ahead in construction of aircraft carriers", "date": "2015-10-05", "content": "Satellite photos analyzed by IHS Janes show China has dramatically ramped up efforts to construct a second aircraft carrier-the first to be built indigenously there. While the new ship will likely not be a match for US aircraft carriers, it is important for a number of reasons, and representative of China's ambitions to be a naval superpower. The ship is in \"advanced state of construction\" in a Dailan shipyard, according to analysis of commercial satellite images by IHS Jane's. And China's goal is reportedly to launch the new carrier by this December (in time for Mao Zedong's 122nd birthday), and outfit it by the end of next year. China's plans to build new carriers have not exactly been a secret. Construction of the ship started in March, and was confirmed to be a carrier by People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials speaking to Hong Kong Commercial Daily. The new carrier, called the Type 001A, will include technology currently only used aboard US carriers, according to PLA Navy senior officers: an electromagnetic catapult that will allow aircraft to be launched with greater fuel and weapons loads. That would put China into a very exclusive club. The Type 001A is likely the first of at least three new carriers that will be built by China. The PLA Navy's existing carrier, the Liaonang-an extensive rebuild of a never-completed former Soviet carrier acquired from Ukraine-took sixteen years to obtain and rebuild. But during that time, China has acquired a wealth of data about how aircraft carriers work-purchasing other derelict carriers (including one from Australia) and technical data from other countries-including data likely stolen from US defense contractors. China's military leaders have said that they believed they could now build a carrier in as little as two years.", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/china-moving-full-speed-ahead-in-construction-of-aircraft-carriers/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Officials Confirm Construction of First Domestic Chinese Aircraft Carrier", "date": "2016-01-04", "content": "China is in the midst of building its first domestic carrier, Ministry of National Defense officials confirmed last week. During a press conference, spokesman Col. Yang Yuju told reporters construction was underway. \"After taking into account a range of factors, the relevant authorities launched work on developing a second aircraft carrier, and we are now undertaking our own indigenous design and construction,\" he said, according to a translation of a Chinese language transcript of the Dec. 31 press conference. \"We have a long coastline and a broad maritime jurisdiction... Defending national maritime security, and safeguarding sovereignty over territorial seas and over maritime rights and interests, are sacred duties of China's armed forces.\" Follow on reports from Chinese state-controlled press said the People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) new carrier was to field its Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark - an unlicensed copy of the Russian Sukhoi Su-33 Flanker - displace about 50,000 tons and retain the short take-off but arrested recovery (STOBAR) configuration of its Soviet-era carrier test platform - Liaoning. The decisions the Chinese made in their new carrier point to a measured approach to the new ship - Type 001A. \"Compared with China's first carrier ... the second carrier will have more mature technology and performance, with better coordination between its systems,\" wrote China's state controlled Xinhua news wire. From the information released by Chinese media, the carrier will be mostly similar to the Kusetnov-class template of Liaoning and absent a catapult launching system. \"Future Chinese carriers will be fitted with catapults for fighter jets to take off on deck, but the process will be gradual since catapult take-off involves more complex technology,\" wrote Xinhua. The details of Type 001A confirms months of speculation and analysis around construction of a ship in a dry dock in China's Dailan shipyard. The construction of the ship resembled the builds of Soviet Kuznetsov-class carrier, reported Jane's in September - a ship with a beam of 115 feet and a length of 866 feet. Jane's stopped short of declaring the ship the Type 001A but several experts confirmed to USNI News in September the ship was China's first domestic carrier. The unexpected confirmation of the Type 001A follows China's irregular efforts of transparency in its military acquisition. Buried in its 2010 Ocean Development Report, China declared it would pursue development of its own domestic carrier program. It took six months for the detail to make it into the Western press. Two years ago, a Chinese party official declared construction of the first domestic aircraft carrier already underway with an eventual goal of four PLAN carriers but those comments were quickly scrubbed from state press. A four-carrier force would mimic traditional carrier deployment patterns in which there are three carriers in maintenance or workups for every carrier deployed.", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2016/01/04/officials-confirm-construction-of-first-domestic-chinese-aircraft-carrier"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "China's Type 001a carrier has nearly finished construction and should launch from drydock in early 2017", "date": "2016-09-08", "content": "China's domestic 001a aircraft carrier is nearly complete and could be ready for sea trials by early 2017 The carrier now awaits only the installation of its superstructure - also known as the \"island\" of an aircraft carrier.

The forward part of the carrier's island structure, including the bridge and main mast supporting structure, has been lifted into place: a significant step in readying China's second aircraft carrier for launch. Fabricated in a covered facility on the dockside, the forward island module is nine decks high and around 30 m long. The aft island module, containing the propulsion plant air intakes and funnel uptakes, was also fabricated on the dockside. Once this is installed, it will give a very clear indication of the carrier's propulsion, which is most likely to be oil-fired boilers and steam turbines, though previously there has been speculation that it could be gas-turbine propelled. Although the new carrier is essentially a Chinese-built version of the Soviet Kuznetsov-class carrier design, some differences from China's first carrier, Liaoning , are becoming evident and are likely to help optimise the installation of Chinese-built sensors such as the 3-D phased array radar. Liaoning is a Soviet-era Kuznetsov-class carrier acquired from Ukraine that is now in People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) service. China's land-based carrier mock-up at Wuhan was modified in 2014, re-positioning the radar's four planar arrays in a higher position and across the corner diagonals of the island superstructure.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102534/http://www.janes.com/article/64097/further-progress-made-on-china-s-type-001a-carrier"}, {"title": "China Adds An Island Tower To Its Aircraft Carrier", "date": "2016-10-06", "content": "The Type 001A \"CV17\" aircraft carrier is China's first domestically built aircraft carrier. In October 2016, it took a key step forward with its island structure fully installed. Since 2014, the \"CV-17\" has been under construction at Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Corporation's drydocks. While the Type 001A largely follows the Soviet design of the Liaoning (ex Varyag) carrier, including a ski-jump ramp for aircraft short takeoffs, some of its more notable changes include a larger displacement, new sensors and optimized aircraft storage. Located on the carrier's starboard (right) side, the island houses the bridge and flight control center, as well as radars. The island, heavily based on the one found on the Soviet-built Liaoning carrier, is so big that Dalian shipyards had to install the structure in two pieces. The new island will be far more capable in what it offers the ship. While the Liaoning has older Type 346 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars (also found on the Type 052C destroyer), CV-17 will have newer Type 346A radars to control its J-15 fighters and detect enemy aircraft and missiles. The best indicator of what the completed CV-17 will look like actually comes from the island on the \"land\" carrier test building in Wuhan, which has also been upgraded with Type 346A radars this year. With all major structures on the CV-17 complete, the remaining tasks before launch include wiring the ship, installing sensors, electronics and self defense weapons, and various key systems like aircraft elevators, ship propellers and rudders. Presently, the CV-17is targeted to hit the water in mid 2017 for fitting out, and then into service with the PLAN, thus expanding China's naval aviation capability and power projection. However, the CV-17 can expect to reach operational status faster that its predecessor benefits from the Liaoning's years of training Chinese carrier pilots. And with more capable carriers in the pipeline, like the catapult-equipped Type 002 and nuclear-powered Type 003, China's blue-water navy will only become more formidable.", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/china-builds-new-islandfor-its-aircraft-carrier/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "China's Second Aircraft Carrier to Begin Sea Trials in 2019", "date": "2017-02-22", "content": "The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN's) first indigenously designed and developed aircraft carrier Shandong is expected to be launched in the coming weeks, China's Ministry of Defense announced on February 21. The aircraft carrier's \"scaffold has been removed and red undercoat has been painted below the ship's waterline in Dalian, northeastern Liaoning Province, and that a launching ceremony will soon be held,\" according to China Military Online. Once launched, the ship is expected to be commissioned into service with the PLAN's North Sea Fleet or East Sea Fleet within the next two years. The new Type 001A aircraft carrier is an improved variant of the PLAN's only operational aircraft carrier, the 60,000-ton Type 001 Liaoning - a retrofitted Soviet-era Admiral Kuznetsov-class multirole aircraft carrier. With a displacement of around 65,000 tons, the Shandong will only be slightly larger than the Type 001 ship. Powered by oil-fired boilers and steam turbines, the ship will have an estimated operational range of 3,850 nautical miles (7,130 kilometers) at about 32 knots. Like the Liaoning, China's second carrier will be able to accommodate up to 24 Shenyang J-15 multirole fighter jets, a variant of the fourth-generation Sukhoi Su-33 twin-engines air superiority fighter, as well as up to ten rotary wing aircraft such as Changshe Z-18, Ka-31, or Harbin Z-9 helicopters. The new carrier will feature a so-called ski-jump assisted Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) launch system. \"Based on information released by the Chinese defense ministry, 001A's aircraft will still use the ski-jump method of taking off from a ski ramp on the front of the carrier just like its 'sister,' the Liaoning, rather than more advanced catapult technology used by U.S. aircraft carriers,\" China Military Online reports. In addition, aircraft launched with a STOBAR system usually also carry lighter armament, reducing the ship's overall combat power. However, there is speculation that the PLAN's next carrier, dubbed Type 002, will be using more modern catapult technology. \"In other words, 002 is entirely different from the Liaoning (001) and 001A, and it will look like [a] U.S. aircraft carrier rather than a Russian one,\" Li Jie, a Chinese naval analyst said in an interview this month. \"The main difference is that [catapult technology is more] flexible and the system's speed can be controlled, so it can launch aircraft of different sizes.\" The catapult assisted take-off but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) aircraft launch system used on U.S. aircraft carriers also puts less strain on an aircraft's frame, allows it to carry a heavier weapons load, and allows a faster takeoff and landing rate. According to Yin Zhuo, a senior researcher at the PLAN's Equipment Research Center, \"in order to protect China's territories and overseas interests, China needs two carrier strike groups in the West Pacific Ocean and two in the Indian Ocean. So we need at least five to six aircraft carriers.\"", "url": "https://thediplomat.com/2017/02/chinas-second-aircraft-carrier-to-begin-sea-trials-in-2019/"}, {"title": "China is about to launch its second aircraft carrier, 001A", "date": "2017-03-06", "content": "CHINA's first homegrown aircraft carrier is nearing completion. The scaffolding has come off, fresh paint is being applied - and new details are emerging of its design. The ship - dubbed Project 001A, or CV17, is likely to be launched within weeks. Adding to the atmosphere of expectation is a Beijing state-media video 'infographic' outlining the modular design and advanced construction of the as yet unnamed aircraft carrier being built in the Chinese port city of Dalian. It reveals that, despite the similarities in appearance, this new ship is a significant improvement over the Soviet design it was reverse-engineered from. However, believed to be given the name Shandong upon its completion , the new aircraft carrier does not represent the future of Chinese naval air power. That ship - designated 002 - is already under construction in Shanghai. It's much bigger. It's probably nuclear powered. And it's said to be much, much more like US aircraft carriers in both form and function. And there are even more to come. \"In order to protect China's territories and overseas interests, China needs two carrier strike groups in the West Pacific Ocean and two in the Indian Ocean. So we need at least five to six aircraft carriers,\" a Chinese defence analyst recently told the People's Daily . LAUNCH PAD: The promotional video confirms the new aircraft carrier has been 'reverse engineered' from the 60,000 ton Soviet-era aircraft carrier Varyag, originally bought by Chinese investors from Ukraine in 1998 under the guise of being converted into a $200 million floating casino. Her sister ship, the Russian Kuznetsov, made headlines last year while laying a thick trail of smoke on its way to take up station off the coast of Syria and contribute to strike operations against forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad. Varyag re-emerged from the Dalian shipyards in 2012 as the 'training' vessel PLAN Liaoning - nominally to give China's military experience in the complicated arena of naval aviation. In November last year Liaoning was declared 'fully operational', and has since deployed to contested waters around Taiwan and the South China Sea. While Liaoning and 'Project 001A' represent a significant step forward in China's ability to project its military might around the globe, the ships themselves do not represent the state-of-the-art. Instead of using catapults to launch aircraft into the sky, they rely on the slingshot effect of a simple ramp, known as a 'ski-jump'. Great Britain, India and Russia use similar ramps because of their technical simplicity and significantly lower cost. However, these ramps do not allow aircraft to carry full loads of bombs or fuel in the same way United States and French aircraft carriers do. This reduces both the combat effectiveness and range of ski-jump carrier-borne aircraft. Unlike Britain's new HMS Queen Elizabeth II and HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carriers, the Chinese ships provide 'arrested recovery' technology for landing aircraft. Essentially these are tensioned wires strapped across the deck which can 'catch' fast-moving and heavy aircraft equipped with a tail hook, quickly bringing them to a halt. This means Liaoning and Project 001A can operate large J-15 Flying Shark strike fighters, themselves reverse-engineered copies of Russian Su-33 'Flanker' aircraft. The new Royal Navy ships are limited to helicopters and the F-35B vertical-landing variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. SOMETHING NEW: China's carrier-construction project has been a carefully guarded secret, with Beijing only admitting in late 2015 that construction work had begun after Janes Defence Weekly published satellite photographs revealing the ship taking shape. But new details have gradually come to light. Project 001A does appear to have many revised features over its Soviet predecessor. \"Its design, combat capability and technologies will be much more advanced,\" Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping told the Global Times outlet of the People's Daily . \"One key difference is the design will be more 'humanised,' which means all personnel on the carrier will enjoy a more comfortable and modern environment.\" But improvements also appear to extend to technical matters. Its flight deck arrangement has been changed, as have the sponsons - projections from the sides of the ship holding weapons, sensors and other equipment. This, combined with an enlarged hangar, is said to allow 001A to carry between six and eight more fighter jets than the 24 Liaoning can stow. The control-tower superstructure also appears to have been modified to accommodate new radars and masts. It was lifted into place on the new hull late last year. \"The Type 001A has learned from US carriers to focus on how to make aircraft on board more functional.\" Beijing-based military analyst Li Jie recently told the South China Morning Post . While the ship may appear visually complete, it is yet to be fitted out. This means it is largely empty, with equipment such as radios and radars - even kitchen appliances and crew bunks - still needing to be installed. \"It will take about one to two years to carry out functional debugging of its devices, weapons and equipment,\" Li Jie told the People's Daily . \"The new aircraft carrier can begin sea trials by early 2019.\"", "url": "https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/china-is-about-to-launch-its-second-aircraft-carrier-001a/news-story/ce97a88eba53b00ea37892698b12504c"}, {"title": "China Launches First Domestic Aircraft Carrier", "date": "2017-04-26", "content": "China has launched its first domestically built aircraft carrier in a ceremony at a northern Chinese shipyard on Wednesday.

According to imagery released by the People's Liberation Army Navy, like Liaoning, the new carrier will rely on a Short Take Off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) system of launching aircraft with fighters launching from a so-called skip-ramp at the bow of the ship.

The Type 001A class carrier, based upon the Soviet Kuznetsov class, follows the Type 001 Liaoning which was refitted from the aged Soviet carried Riga - sold by Ukraine as the Varyag in 1998. The Liaoning was subject to a massive overhaul, essentially taking a rusting hulk and turning it into a serviceable combat asset capable of launching Chinese J-15 jets. This was a learning exercise for China's navy and shipbuilding industry - taking the Cold War hulk and learning everything they could from it. The new, yet to be named, Type 001A is a very different beast. The Type 001A is China's first domestically produced carrier and while it owes much to the reverse engineering of the Riga and the lessons learnt with the Liaoning, it is very much China's first step towards an entirely domestically designed air craft carrier. The Type 001A was officially launched from Dalian shipyard on 26 April 2017, and is believed to be capable of carrying up to 40 aircraft and displace up to 70,000 tonnes, roughly 5,000 more than the Liaoning. While technical details on the vessel are sparse from the available photographs its clear to see some differences. Unlike the Liaoning, the Type 001A, has a second windowed deck command and control deck, in its island separating the bridge and flight operations to simplify communications and streamline command of ship and air elements. The upper radar elements of the island have also been redesigned to give cleaner lines. The Drive reports that the 001A moves to a 12-degree ski-jump flight deck slope instead of the Liaoning's 15-degrees. The 001A also has more space for aircraft and subsystems. The ship's systems and electronics are entirely modern, not relying on established Soviet infrastructure like the Liaoning. This will improve the 001A's efficiency but will still require a 5,000 man complement. China's carriers have not yet entered the Nuclear age and the 001A is powered by conventional steam turbines which give the vessel a top speed of 31 knots. While the new carrier was originally scheduled to enter service with the People's Liberation Army Navy in 2020, early delivery is now believed likely, with the ship entering service as early as late 2018/early 2019. China's next carrier is said to be an entirely indigenous design, the Type 002, with a projected displacement of 80,000 tonnes and a length of 320 metres. The Type 002 is already reported to be followed by China's next generation carrier, the Type 003 nuclear carrier.

The carrier, which was launched last April and had its maiden voyage in May, has yet to be named but carries the official designation of Type 001A. The vessel's design is based on the Soviet Kuznetsov-class carrier. China's first carrier, the Liaoning, was originally built in the Soviet Union in the final years of the Cold War. It was purchased from Ukraine in 1998 and refurbished at the Dalian naval shipyard in northeastern China. The Liaoning went into active service in 2016. Both Chinese carriers are thought to displace about 65,000 metric tons fully loaded, which makes them considerably smaller than the 10 U.S. Nimitz-class carriers, the largest in active service. The South China Morning Post reports that the new carrier \"headed out to the Yellow Sea two days after a Type 055 guided-missile destroyer, the region's most advanced and biggest destroyer, and the carrier's likely escort, also started its maiden sea trial.\" Military analysts quoted by the Post said the vessel's second and final sea trial could last anywhere from six months to a year, after which it would be handed over to the China's navy for commissioning by October 2019 for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. \"This time the focus will be on testing the endurance of the new aircraft carrier's propulsion system. The communications, command, damage control, lift operations and weapon systems will also be [examined],\" Hong Kong-based military expert Song Zhongping told the newspaper. Meanwhile, the Post reports separately that the Liaoning was undergoing a refit to upgrade its command center on the ship's \"island\" conning tower. \"According to Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie, the new structures are likely to be similar to those on the country's second aircraft carrier, the Type 001A,\" the Post says. The latest Chinese aircraft carrier starts sea trials amid growing tensions between the U.S. Navy and the naval wing of the People's Liberation Army, particularly in and around the South China Sea. In a meeting in June between Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader reportedly said his country would not yield \"one inch\" of the South China Sea. The Financial Times reports that the meeting was meant for Mattis to deliver a \"medium tough\" warning to the Chinese leader that the U.S. is not happy about Beijing's militarization of several artificial islands in the region. China has competing claims with its maritime neighbors over several island chains in the South China and East China seas.

The test began after more than six weeks of maintenance on the Type 001A - a 315 metre (1,033 feet) long, 50,000-tonne vessel - at its home port of Dalian in Liaoning province. The latest trial, which may involve take-off and landing drills for some of its 32 J-15 fighter jets, would mean technical snagging was complete and the carrier will soon go into service, analysts said. Recent online photos showed three blast deflectors and three aircraft on the flight deck. The deflector is a device that redirects the exhaust from a jet engine, especially on take-off, to prevent heat damage to the deck and injury to deck crew. Liaoning Maritime Safety Administration said on Tuesday that an area off the east coast of Dalian in the northern Yellow Sea would be closed to marine \u00adtraffic between Wednesday and Sunday for military exercises. The Type 001A embarked upon its five-day maiden voyage in May. Its second sea trial began on August 27 and the third got under way on October 30. The lag between the third and fourth trial is the shortest, which suggests that the Type 001A is making headway toward its official delivery to the PLA Navy. Hong Kong-based military expert Song Zhongping said aircraft drills means all other technical issues have been solved. \"The previous three sea trials mainly solved problems like communications and power, which builds a foundation for the exercises involving warplanes,\" he said. \"If the warplanes can smoothly take off and land, then it means the indigenous aircraft carrier will soon enter service.\" Beijing based military observer Zhou Chenming echoed that view, and said sea trials should improve the carrier's air operations. The defence ministry has not yet confirmed when the Type 001A will enter service, but spokesman Ren Guoqiang said in late November that it was \"making steady progress according to the plan, and the sea trials were safe and smooth and achieved the desired objectives\". Based on the Liaoning, the Soviet Admiral Kuznetsov class vessel that became the PLA's first commissioned aircraft carrier, the Type 001A features some significant modifications, including upgraded radar and bridge systems. The Type 001A, which will displace 70,000 tonnes when fully laden, will carry 32 J-15s compared to the Liaoning's 26.

It is the first aircraft carrier designed and built in China, and it returned to the shipyard on Tuesday after spending 13 days off the northeast coast in the Yellow Sea - the longest trial so far, according to Chinese media reports. The Type 001A, which has yet to be named, was believed to have carried out a range of complex tests during the latest trial, and Beijing-based military expert Li Jie said the testing was nearly finished. \"The vessel has probably completed 80 to 90 per cent of the necessary tests,\" Li said. \"I think it's possible it can be delivered by the Chinese Navy Day on April 23.\" He said the warship might be able to take part in the PLA Navy's fleet review to be held that day off Qingdao, in Shandong province. Photos circulated online of the aircraft carrier returning to Dalian, in Liaoning province, showed what appeared to be a J-15 multirole fighter jet as well as a helicopter on its deck. When it left the port on December 27, photos of the 50,000-tonne vessel showed it was carrying three aircraft and three blast deflectors, which protect the deck and crew from jet engine exhaust. Li said the jets were likely to have carried out flyover tests and touchdowns on the deck, but probably not the full range of aircraft operations because that would only be possible when every system on the warship was ready. Launched in April 2017, the vessel made its maiden voyage over five days in May last year. That was followed by a 10-day trial in August-September and another 10 days at sea in October-November. If the warship does enter service in April, it will have made faster progress than China's first and only operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, which was handed over 13\u00bd months after its maiden voyage. \"The engineers have gained experience after working on the Liaoning - such as what are the key issues or weaknesses the tests should focus on, and which areas are less likely to be problems,\" Li said. \"So that means the testing on this vessel will move faster than for the Liaoning, it will take less time.\" The Type 001A is based on the Liaoning - a Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier that China bought from Ukraine in 1998 when it was half-built. China began refitting the warship in 2005 at the same shipyard in Dalian and it went through 10 sea trials - including one lasting 25 days and another carried out during a typhoon - before it was commissioned in 2012.

The testing of carrier-based aircraft could be the focus of this sea trial, an IC photo caption reads. Photos taken by local residents and uploaded to the internet last week show guide lines and possibly a non-skid coating were being painted on the Type 001A's flight deck, which are considered necessary for the takeoff and landing of aircraft. The warship is said to have already successfully tested its avionics, radar and communication systems in previous trials, so it is likely fighter jets will conduct take offs and landings this time, an anonymous military expert told the Global Times. Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times that he believes such a test is likely, or at least there will be preparations to enable future tests. \"This sea trial will go a step further toward the final delivery of the new aircraft carrier,\" Li said.

The Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, was already at sea after leaving the Dalian Shipyard on Sunday. The two aircraft carriers could rendezvous in the northern Yellow Sea near Dalian, Chinese military observers said, as an area has been quarantined for a military exercise from Sunday to March 5, according to a notice the Maritime Safety Administration of China released on Friday.

Its indigenously- built carrier vessel, the Type 002 CV-17 , has gone through five trials, and could be commissioned as early as July this year. The Print had reported in November 2018 that the CV-17, China's second carrier vessel and the first to be built indigenously, was well ahead of schedule. And the latest satellite images of the Dalian Shipyard indicate that ship has returned from its fifth trial and received a final coat of paint. Any blue-water navy needs carrier vessels, which is why China's People's Liberation Army Navy has fast-tracked their development. It is creating the Jiangnan Changxing facility near Shanghai to augment the Dalian Shipyard in faster production of CVs. Fourth trial: The CV-17's fourth trial was conducted in the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea. It left Dalian on 27 December 2018 and returned to home port on 8 January 2019. It was observed interacting very closely with other ships and travelling from the Yellow Sea to Bohai in a formation on 30 December 2018. The ship possibly conducted inter-operability tests and synced its electronic equipment and gadgetry with other ships of the fleet. The CV-17 was almost static in the Bohai area. It is speculated that this was for touch-and-go trials, which are more difficult on a static carrier than a moving one. However, no aircraft tyre marks were observed on the ship's landing strip, so touch-and-go or landing trials cannot be confirmed to have taken place. Fifth trial: The fifth trial was a super-short sea trial. It began on 28 February and was completed by 8 March. The PLAN's original carrier, the CV-16 Liaoning, also moved out of Dalian with its consort ship Daguan #88. Both possibly participated in an exercise being carried out in the East China Sea. Both ships later returned to their home ports, Qingdao and Dalian. New coat of paint: The PLAN began repainting of the deck of the CV-17 on 22 March. The primer coat was seen being applied on the deck in a satellite image from 23 March. This coat was observed to be complete on 2 April. The latest satellite images from Dalian indicate that the final coat has been applied on the CV-17. The shade of the new coat is much darker than the previous coat, very similar to its predecessor, the CV-16 Liaoning. Some of the signatures also indicate that an anti-skid coating has also been applied.

It returned August 23, 2019 after its longest test campaign to date which lasted 22 days. This 2nd aircraft carrier for the PLAN, designed by the engineers of the 701 Institute of the CSIC group on the basis of Project 1134.5 Varyag , is set to be commissioned, as expected, before the end of the year. East Pendulum **predicted this back in 2016** when the vessel was still in dry dock. In addition to the Chinese Navy receiving its 2nd aircraft carrier, we are likely to see by December 2019 the launch of the **1st Type 075 LHD currently under construction** at Hudong Shipyard. -Zhonghua in Shanghai, and by the possible keel laying of the 3rd aircraft carrier at Jiangnan Changxing shipyard, also located in Shanghai. While state media have not disclosed any details on the latest sea trials of \"Type 002\" it is our understanding that it took place in the Yellow Sea, in a maritime area measuring 3,387 km^2 and bounded by a perimeter of 233 km. The tests seem to have been organized in two stages, first from August 1st to 4th which is announced by the LN-0148 maritime safety notification , then from August 6th to 22nd by another LN-0159 notification for the exact same area. Civil or unauthorized ships are advised not to enter the perimeter for \"military maneuvers\". Although the Chinese navy has not yet received its new aircraft carrier, and therefore the data are not yet complete, the comparison of sea trial times initiated by the aircraft carrier Liaoning and its quasi-sister-ship gives provides us with some interesting findings. For example, we can see that it was not until the 9th set of trials that Liaoning made its longest 25-day trial, while the \"Type 002\" did it on its 7th outing. The new Chinese aircraft carrier also made shorter outings, averaging less than 9 days on its first 6 outings, before reaching its long test run, compared with more than 10 days on average for Liaoning 's 8 first outings. In short, the outings of the \"Type 002\" are shorter, more spaced out, but also less numerous, at least according to the figures to date. This could therefore suggest an evolution of the test program as well as the military standards associated with the aircraft carriers in the Chinese Navy but also in the naval industry, made possible probably by the feedback from Liaoning. It should be noted that satellite images showed that the new Chinese aircraft carrier was making rounds at sea. If we do not know the date and the exact location of these satellite images, some media used the term \"Williamson turn\" to qualify these maneuvers. According to a former technical officer of the Chinese Navy, however, these circles seen by commercial satellites are simply part of the nominal tests of all ships, military or civilian. Vessels have to be tested at 3 different speed and 2 different rudder angles per side . That's a total of 12 individual tests for ships conducting their trials. According to the source, the circles observed have little to do with the Williamson turn.", "url": "https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2019/09/type-002-chinas-2nd-aircraft-carrier-to-be-commissioned-by-year-end/"}, {"title": "China's new carrier doing its last sea trial", "date": "2019-10-17", "content": "China's first domestically-built aircraft carrier is reportedly \"all set\" for commissioning by the end of the year after it put to sea for the eighth time on Tuesday. Chinese papers hinted that it could be the last sea trial before the 70,000-ton vessel graduates to becoming a fully-fledged sea-going airbase to join the Chinese military and add to its naval capabilities. The carrier's sea trial is scheduled to end on October 22. It was announced earlier this week that the provincial maritime authority had cordoned off a large swathe of water in the Bohai Sea off Dalian, the homeport of the not-yet-christened warship, where it was also built. Such voyages during the past two years often involve the new ship carrying a few J-15 fighter jets as well as aircraft arresting gear in waters that are off-limits to civilian vessels. The carrier is referred to as the Type 001A in state media and it was launched in April 2017 at the Dalian Shipyard. The carrier's propulsion, communication and navigation systems have presumably been tested to ascertain reliability throughout its recent cruises in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea since the beginning of this year and those trips could have involved the launching and recovery of aircraft. Still, the time it has taken before going into service has been longer than expected. Its sister ship, the Liaoning, took a little over one year to complete 10 sea trials in 2012, after Chinese shipbuilders refurbished and repurposed a Soviet-built hull purchased from Ukraine in the 1990s. The Type 001A is an evolution of the earlier Admiral Kuznetsov-class carrier with a host of indigenous tweaks to the original Soviet design, and thus more caution and a loose timeframe for trials were warranted. Observers say the new ship is on track to enter service by the end of the year at a propitious time when Beijing needs more naval assets to project power in the South and East China Seas. Future Chinese carriers will be bigger and more potent with each ship under construction or being planned to narrow the gap with the supercarriers in service with the US Navy. A third ship is swiftly taking shape at Shanghai's Jiangnan Shipyard and is expected do away with the curled-up bow for a flattop look with a cutting-edge electromagnetic catapult to launch fighter jets, and the fourth one may even be nuclear powered.

The rotorcraft comprise what appears to be a trio of Changhe Z-18s and a single Harbin Z-9. The carrier recently sailed from the Dalian shipyard to Hainan Island via the Taiwan Strait. When commissioned (and named) the Type-001A will become China's second operational carrier after Liaoning, which was developed from the hulk of the Varyag, a Kuznetsov-class carrier that the Soviet Union never completed owing to the end of the Cold War. The Type-001A represents a major milestone for Beijing as it is the country's first locally designed and built aircraft carrier. Though it resembles Liaoning, with the same conventional powerplant, reports suggest it can carry 44 aircraft, compared with 36 for Liaoning. The vessel also has updated radars and a modernised bridge. Both Liaoning and Type-001A use a ski-jump to launch fixed-wing aircraft. This limits payload and precludes operations of support aircraft for missions such as airborne early warning & control (AEW&C) and antisubmarine warfare. China's third carrier, the Type-002, will be equipped with electromagnetic aircraft launch and recovery systems (EMALS), allowing it to operate a similar mix of fixed wing aircraft as found on US Navy aircraft carriers.

The impressions suggest that the twin-turboprop KJ-600 will also have a carrier on-board delivery (COD) variant similar to the C-2 Greyhound, and an anti-submarine warfare variant.", "url": "https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/chinas-newest-aircraft-carrier-docks-at-hainan/135493.article"}, {"title": "China commissions first indigenously-built aircraft carrier 'Shandong'", "date": "2019-12-17", "content": "With President Xi Jinping in attendance, China on Tuesday commissioned the Type 002-class aircraft carrier Shandong in Sanya in the island province of Hainan, bordering the South China Sea. This puts China in a group of only four countries that have multiple fixed-wing aircraft carriers, with the US, UK and Italy being the others. The Chinese state-run news outlet Global Times cited a CCTV report saying that the carrier would have a displacement of around 40,000 to 60,000 tons and an airwing of up to 36 J-15 'flying shark' fighters . It is expected to have many improvements over the country's other carrier, the Liaoning , with a similar ski-jump flight deck, a \"more advanced electronic devices and control and command system\" and an \"optimized superstructure and internal layout\". According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, the carrier can also carry KA-28/Ka-31/Z-8s/Z-8JH/Z-8AEW helicopters. China has kept details of the carrier project under wraps, with the project itself only officially announced in 2015. The United States Naval Intelligence News reported that one domestically-built carrier was being built in the Dalian Shipyard while satellite images shared by CSIS showed another under construction at the Jiangnan shipyard, expected to be the more advanced Type-003 project. With a STOBAR configuration, the Shandong would be China's second carrier after the Kuznetsov -class Liaoning , which was purchased from Ukraine in 1998 and used as a training ship-later declared combat-ready in 2016. The addition of the Shandong to the Chinese fleet will greatly enhance the PLAN's capabilities in the South China Sea. The Hainan province where the ship was launched is located to the East of Vietnam, which contests the SCS with China along with Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Brunei. In November, China sailed the Shandong through the Taiwan strait, resulting in Taiwan scrambling fighters and jets and both the US and Japan trailing the ship with their own vessels. A third Chinese carrier project is also reportedly under way, the Type 003, with plans to have four in operation by 2024 . After the retirement of the INS Viraat in 2017, India has only one aircraft carrier in service, the 45,000-ton Kiev -class INS Vikramaditya. The domestically-built INS Vikrant has faced multiple delays and is expected to commence basin trials in 2020, with delivery to the Navy expected by 2021. The Global Times stated that the China is now the first Asian country to operate a domestically-built carrier since World War II. This feat would have been achieved by India in 2018 had INS Vikrant been inducted as per schedule.

Xi inspected an honor guard during the ceremony and met with PLAN personnel aboard the carrier, the Global Times reported on December 17. The Shandong was launched in April 2017 and began sea trials one year later in April 2018. The carrier conducted a total of nine sea trials. During its last sea trial in November, the Shandong passed through the Taiwan Strait and entered the South China Sea. In comparison, the PLAN's sole operational aircraft carrier, the 60,000-ton Liaoning, a retrofitted Soviet-era Admiral Kuznetsov-class multirole aircraft carrier, completed 10 sea trials before being commissioned in 2012. The Shandong will be able to accommodate up to 32 fighter aircraft in total, according to senior PLAN officers. With today's commissioning, the PLAN is now operating two aircraft carriers, although it will take the Shandong around a decade to be combat-ready, while the Liaoning primarily serves as a training platform for Chinese naval aviation. It may also take a decade or two for a next-generation carrier-based strike aircraft to be deployed aboard the PLAN's flattops. Chinese pilots and aviation personnel will also need to gain additional experience in operating aircraft from carriers. As Steven Stashwick pointed out in these pages, the Shandong will likely be beset by so-called \"first-in-class problems,\" technical and engineering issues that will only become apparent once the ship will begin conducting operations, which will impact the carrier's reliability. Stashwick also noted that China's future carrier force may be limited to four hulls due to the massive costs associated with building these huge flattops. Additionally, the PLAN will also have to gain further experience operating a carrier strike group (CSG). A future PLAN CSG will most likely be composed of Jiangkai-II-class (Type 054A) frigates, Luyang-III-class (Type 052D) destroyers, Renhai-class Type 055 destroyers, and one to two Yuan-class (Type 039A) or alternatively Song-class (Type 039) submarines in addition to support vessels.

Xi attended the commissioning ceremony in the southern province of Hainan Tuesday, according to state-run media, where the Shandong finally entered service as part of the People's Liberation Navy. According to state-run news agency Xinhua, Xi presented a Chinese flag and a certificate with the ship's official name to the ship's captain and political commissar. The Shandong, which uses conventional rather than nuclear propulsion, is the second carrier in the Chinese fleet. China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, a retrofitted Soviet-era vessel, was purchased from the Ukrainian government in 1998. Both the Liaoning and the Shandong use ski-jump style ramps at the end of the flight deck to launch planes, a comparatively older technology compared to the United States Navy's preferred \"catapult\" technology. Aircraft launched by catapults can get airborne quicker and with greater quantities of fuel and ammunition, giving them an advantage over Chinese planes, which rely on their own power when lifting off from ski-jumps. The aircraft carrier's name was officially announced on Tuesday. Before then, it had been only known as the Type 001A. Both of China's aircraft carriers, the Shandong and the Liaoning, are named after coastal provinces close to Beijing. According to Peter Layton, visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute, the Liaoning was intended to act as more of a training vessel, whereas the Shandong is likely to be deployed in combat missions, positioning China alongside a select number of countries with global naval capabilities, including Russia, France, the US, and the United Kingdom.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/17/asia/china-aircraft-carrier-shandong-intl-hnk/index.html"}, {"title": "China's Second Aircraft Carrier Type 002 \"Shandong\" Commissioned With The Chinese Navy", "date": "2019-12-19", "content": "The People's Liberation Army Navy commissioned into service the new Type 002 aircraft carrier on December 17, 2019 in presence of President Xi Jinping. The ship, which has been named Shandong and given hull number 17, is China's first domestically built aircraft carrier and was developed from their first carrier, the Liaoning, which is in turn a refitted Kuznetsov -class carrier bought second-hand from Ukraine in 1998. The commissioning ceremony took place at a naval base in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, where is expected to be based. This move will give the carrier a quick access to the South China Sea where there are currently territorial disputes between China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei, involving both maritime boundaries and islands. The construction of the ship began in 2013 at the Dalian Shipyard, North-East China Liaoning Province, contracted to the No.701 Research Institute of the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation . After being launched in April 2017 , the carrier underwent a trial phase which took longer than expected, with the first sea trial in May 2018, and the commissioning originally planned in April 2019 had to be postponed. The Shandong is a conventional-powered aircraft carrier with an approximate displacement, according to most sources, ranging between 40,000 to 60,000 tons. Like the Liaoning, the carrier features a Short Take-Off Barrier Arrested Landing configuration with the embarked aircraft taking off with the help of a ski-jump , rather than using a catapult like the US aircraft carriers, and landing by catching the arrestor wires. According to Chinese media, the Shandong, built taking in account the operational feedback from the Liaoning, is equipped with an optimized layout and more advanced radar and Command and Control systems. The ship can reportedly carry 36 Shenyang J-15 fighter jets, more than the 24 carried by the Liaoning. With the commissioning of the Shandong, China has now two aircraft carriers, of which the older one devoted to training, and according to some sources started building a third one that could use a catapult launch system. This expansion of the fleet reflects the modernization of the Chinese Armed Forces in the last few years as the country aims to expand its economic and military influence in the area.", "url": "https://theaviationist.com/2019/12/19/chinas-second-aircraft-carrier-type-002-shandong-commissioned-with-the-chinese-navy/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "China's first home-built aircraft carrier, the Shandong, tightens shore leave regulations to combat coronavirus", "date": "2020-02-19", "content": "Shore leave rules for the crew of China's first home-built aircraft carrier have been tightened to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus on board, the navy said. Embarking and disembarking from the Shandong will now involve extra security, Naval News, an official website of the People's Liberation Army Navy, reported on Tuesday. Naval command headquarters has set a daily quota for the crew, and whoever wants to go ashore must have personal permission from Captain Lai Yijun or Political Commissar Pang Jianhong after medical screening. \"That was to cut off the possible transmission outside the ship and block the virus before any infection,\" the navy said. It did not say what, if any, extra measures were applied to other Chinese warships. While the crew of the 65,000 tonne warship will stick to routine duties and training programmes, the Shandong will step up hygiene regulations and drills. \"Each and every corner\" of the vessel has been disinfected, Naval News, which referred to a \"closed-off management\" situation on the ship, said. It stressed that military training should not be affected by outbreak precautions, while emergency breakdown drills and studies on missile defence went ahead as usual. Some of the Shandong crew were in the worst-hit areas of China, the report said, but there had not been any cases of infection. It did not say if those crew members were on leave or seconded to emergency operations. The novel coronavirus was identified in January and has spread across China. It causes the disease known as Covid-19 - and that has infected about 74,000 people and killed more than 2,000. Shandong is China's second commissioned carrier after the Liaoning, with a complement of more than 1,000. It went into service on December 17 after a ceremony on the southern island of Hainan. Last year, the PLA Navy said it planned to have four carrier strike groups and has stepped up pilot training, choosing to take cadets from naval aeronautical universities rather than enlist experienced air force pilots. In the Shandong's home port of Sanya, 54 cases of coronavirus were reported by Wednesday, with 22 people cured and one fatality. On Hainan, there were 163 cases and four deaths.

China's first indigenously-built aircraft carrier, the Type 001A Shandong left the Dalian Shipyard in northeast China's Liaoning Province for military missions at sea on May 25. This is its maiden voyage for training since commissioned five months ago, marking that the Shandong has primarily formed combat effectiveness. The training is to test the performance of weapons and equipment and improve the level of aircraft carrier training, so as to further enhance the troops' ability to perform missions and tasks, Senior Colonel Ren said. The Shandong Type 001A is a first-generation Chinese aircraft carrier that was launched on 26 April 2017 for the People's Liberation Army Navy of the People's Republic of China . It is the second aircraft carrier built by the Chinese naval defense industry after the completion of Liaoning. China's first aircraft carrier, Liaoning, entered service in 2012. China's second aircraft carrier , Shandong Type 001A, entered service on December 17, 2019. The Shandong is a modified version of the Liaoning design that incorporates some design improvements, including features that reportedly will permit it to embark and operate a larger air wing of 40 aircraft that includes 36 fighters. Its displacement is estimated at 66,000 to 70,000 tons. China's primary carrier-based fighter aircraft is the J-15 or Flying Shark, an aircraft derived from the Russian Su-33 Flanker aircraft design that can operate from carriers equipped with a ski ramp rather than catapults. China reportedly plans to develop a carrier-capable variant of its J-20 fifth- generation stealth fighter and/or a carrier-capable variant of its FC-31 fifth-generation stealth fighter to complement or succeed the J-15 on catapult-equipped Chinese carriers.

Ren Guoqiang, a spokesman for China's Ministry of National Defense, confirmed on Friday during a media briefing. Footage of Shandong, released by the ministry, shows the carrier launching and recovering Shenyang J-15 fighters. Shandong is China's People's Liberation Army Navy's second aircraft carrier, but the first one built domestically. China's other carrier is Liaoning, which was initially built by the Soviet Union. China spent years refitting the carrier before putting it into service in 2012. \"The PLA Navy is conducting sea trials and training exercises for aircraft carrier Shandong in accordance with the annual training plan,\" Ren said. The carrier was reported operating in the northern region of the Yellow Sea, according to an account in The South China Morning Post, which first reported Shandong's sea trials. China started constructing Shandong in November 2013 at Dalian Shipbuilding, a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding Corp, according to China's Ministry of National Defense. Shandong has a displacement of at least 49,000 tons and a conventional propulsion system. In comparison, two nuclear reactors power each of the U.S. Navy's new Ford-class carriers, which have displacements of 100,000 tons. Shandong left for sea trials just days after the White House released a report criticizing China's expanding use of economic and military power to coerce nations to adopt China's world view. The report, United States Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China, was released on May 20 and was required by the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019. \"Beijing contradicts its rhetoric and flouts its commitments to its neighbors by engaging in provocative and coercive military and paramilitary activities in the Yellow Sea, the East and South China Seas, the Taiwan Strait, and Sino-Indian border areas,\" the White House report states. On Friday, during the same briefing he confirmed Shandong's sea trials, Ren countered the White House report's claims. \"The current situation in the South China Sea is generally stable. The United States sent warships and aircraft to the South China Sea to carry out the so-called freedom of navigation operations to conduct close-in reconnaissance against China's islands and reefs and hold targeted military exercises. These operations are the real drivers for militarization of the South China Sea. China urges the U.S. side to respect the efforts made by the countries in the region to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea and make more positive and constructive efforts,\" Ren said, according to the briefing's English language transcript released by the ministry. China sent Shandong through the Taiwan Strait in December, shortly after its commissioning and just weeks before Taiwan's presidential election.

Two combat-ready aircraft carriers will have strategic significance for China to resist military pressure from countries like the US in the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea, and potentially from India on China's key maritime transport lanes, experts said. After a display of fireworks and under the assistance of several tug boats, the Shandong embarked from the Dalian Shipyard in Northeast China's Liaoning Province on Tuesday morning, Hong Kong-based news website wenweipo.com reported on the same day. The carrier had full-scale models of a J-15 fighter jet and a Z-18 helicopter on its flight deck when it left Dalian, the report said. The voyage coincided with a notice released by China's Maritime Safety Administration on Monday, which set a navigation restriction in the Bohai Sea from Tuesday to September 22 for an undisclosed military mission. The restriction zone is in the waters off a Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy Aviation Force base, so putting these factors together, the Shandong 's voyage will likely feature integrated training with fighter jets in the sea area, wenweipo.com predicted. China has been producing new J-15 aircraft carrier-based fighter jets and training new pilots for the Shandong in recent years, and this voyage could see the carrier integrated with those capabilities as a crucial part of its combat preparedness, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Tuesday. According to photos released by the Shenyang Aircraft Co under the Aviation Industry Corp of China , the manufacturer of the J-15, on its website in February, the company was producing new J-15s at that time. A J-15 under assembly was seen getting new, green priming paint instead of the previous yellow one, which indicated that it features a new type of anti-corrosion material for better performance at sea, reports said then. Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie told the Global Times on Tuesday that after the latest exercise, it will not take the Shandong long to become combat capable, thanks to experience garnered on the country's first carrier, the Liaoning. Hopefully within this year, the Shandong will conduct another training session, which will eventually give it the basis for initial combat capability, Li predicted. The Shandong was commissioned into the PLA Navy on December 17, 2019 in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province and it returned to the Dalian Shipyard later that month.

Recently, China has been facing military pressure from countries like the US in the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea, and potentially from India on China's key maritime transport lanes, and Li Jie said that the Shandong , together with the first carrier Liaoning, will become key forces. Two aircraft carriers can squeeze the island of Taiwan from different angles, and together with the DF-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles of the PLA Rocket Force, they can lock down the island and deny possible US intervention, Li Jie said, noting that they can also play a role in protecting crucial maritime transport lanes like the Strait of Malacca.", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1199551.shtml"}, {"title": "China's two aircraft carriers complete drills in September", "date": "2020-09-25", "content": "China's two aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong, recently completed military drills in the South China Sea, according to a statement by the Chinese Ministry of Defense on Thursday.

It was a year struck by the COVID-19 pandemic, and many warships, including four US aircraft carriers headed by USS Theodore Roosevelt were severely hit by the novel coronavirus. But the Shandong does not seem to have been affected by the virus due to its effective epidemic control and prevention measures, smoothly conducted training and exercises, and for the third time - the first since COVID-19 - the vessel sailed through the Taiwan Straits, analysts noted. Prior to the Shandong 's Taiwan Straits transit, media on the island of Taiwan wrongly reported that it was the Liaoning , the PLA's first aircraft carrier, that was about to sail through the Taiwan Straits, and leaders of Taiwan's defense authorities on Monday rushed to a command center to deal with the situation. Every time a PLA aircraft carrier group passes through the Taiwan Straits, it causes nervousness to Taiwan authorities, but such transits have already become routine, Chinese mainland observers said. The Liaoning sailed through the Taiwan Straits on various occasions since its commissioning in September 2012. The Shandong also sailed through the Straits twice in late 2019, before and after its commissioning ceremony in Sanya. By sailing through the Taiwan Straits, which is to the west of Taiwan island, rather than a route on the east side, the PLA could be understood as demonstrating its control in the Straits and China's sovereignty over the island of Taiwan, Xu said. On Friday evening, US Navy destroyer USS Mustin sailed through the Taiwan Straits, and the PLA Eastern Theater Command organized naval and aerial forces to track and monitor its course, the command revealed on Saturday. The island of Taiwan recently also started construction of new submarines and launched new warships, while the US has been approving arms sales to the island, all with the PLA in mind. The Shandong 's transit on Sunday could also be seen a countermeasure in response to Taiwan regional authorities' latest military provocations, and it could also aim to deter secessionists on the island and the US incumbent administration from colluding to stir troubles in the region, Xu said. Experts said that the Chinese mainland will operate more and more aircraft carriers, and transits in the Taiwan Straits will only become more frequent. Another Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Sunday that the Taiwan military is making an empty show of strength by claiming it has a grasp of PLA activities, and the move aims to comfort and attract attention to people on the island. Taiwan military's actions will be meaningless in wartime, and PLA's aircraft carriers will enable the mainland to resolve the Taiwan question more efficiently, the expert said. \"It is not the Taiwan military the PLA aircraft carriers have in mind, but stronger opponents,\" the expert said.", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1210493.shtml"}, {"title": "China aircraft carrier sails through Taiwan Strait raising alarm", "date": "2020-12-21", "content": "An aircraft carrier group led by China's newest carrier, the Shandong, sailed through the Taiwan Strait on its way to routine drills in the South China Sea, China's navy said on Monday, after Taiwan mobilised its forces to monitor the convoy. The Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait a day after a US warship passed through the same stretch of sea. China's navy said the Shandong and its accompanying ships had \"smoothly\" travelled through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Sunday, heading for exercises in the South China Sea, where China has made extensive territorial claims in the disputed waters. The drills are part of \"normal arrangements made in accordance with annual plans\", it said. \"In the future, we will continue to organise similar operations based on training needs.\" The carrier's move through the strait comes amid rising tension between China and Taiwan, which Beijing sees as part of its territory. The democratically ruled island says it has recorded almost daily incursions into its airspace by the Chinese armed forces in recent months. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said the Shandong was accompanied by four warships and had set out from the northern Chinese port of Dalian on Thursday. In a statement on its website, it said the convoy continued to move south. Taiwan said it sent six warships and eight military aircraft to monitor the Chinese ships' movements. \"The military has the confidence and ability to protect its homeland, ensure national security and maintain regional peace and stability,\" the statement said. The Shandong is China's second carrier, and was formally commissioned almost exactly a year ago.

The Shandong recently underwent a series of test exercises in the Bohai Sea, focusing on training objectives including departing port at night, sailing through narrow water channels, maritime search and rescue and damage management, China Central Television reported on Monday. It also strengthened training on aviation support and further boosted the training level of crew members under high-intensity logistics support, CCTV said. The report showed scenes of the Shandong training at night to the public for the first time, military observers noted. Night operations are crucial to any military unit, and many tactical and strategic opportunities and threats come at night, a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Tuesday, requesting anonymity. The night exercises show how quick the Shandong 's progress is to gain round-the-clock combat capability, the expert said. \"It won't be long before we see night fighter jet takeoff and landing exercises on the Shandong.\" CCTV said that the night training was held in the Bohai Sea, and this means it likely took place before December 20, when the Shandong set out from Dalian Shipyard by the Bohai Sea, sailed through the Taiwan Straits and entered the South China Sea. Senior Captain Liu Wensheng, a spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army Navy, said at the time that the Shandong aircraft carrier group will conduct exercises in the South China Sea, which is a normal arrangement in accordance with its annual schedule. \"The PLA Navy will continue to hold more operations like this based on training requirements,\" he said.

The drills, which have been in the works for over a month, were postponed earlier in the year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Beijing states that out of its 2.3 million personnel, there are currently no reported coronavirus cases within the military. The Shandong carrier group sailed through the Taiwan Strait a day after a US warship transited the same waterway. China's military said it tailed the ship.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy recently organized the Shandong aircraft carrier group for exercises in waters in the South China Sea, Senior Captain Gao Xiucheng, a spokesperson from the PLA Navy, said in a statement on Sunday. The drill is a regular series of exercises organized based on the annual work schedule, and is fully legitimate and legal, Gao said, noting that it will contribute to boosting the service's capability to safeguard China's sovereignty, security and development interests as well as regional peace and stability. \"We hope the outside world can view [the Shandong's exercise] objectively and rationally. The PLA Navy will continue to organize similar exercises according to the plan regularly in the future,\" Gao said.

Gao did not announce which ships other than the Shandong are included in the group. Analysts pointed out that the Shandong's latest exercises come immediately after the end of exercises by another Chinese aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, also in the South China Sea. The Liaoning carrier group recently conducted routine drills and training in waters around Taiwan and related waters in the South China Sea, Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, said at a regular press conference on Thursday. According to Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff, the Liaoning left the region as it had returned to the East China Sea on April 26 via the Miyako Strait. Having two aircraft carriers means the PLA Navy can deploy these large warships more often, according to the anonymous expert, who noted that when one undergoes maintenance, the other can take its place.

It is the Shandong's first scheduled maintenance that would enhance the ship's usability, the report said. In addition to the visible changes, the Shandong has also likely received maintenance and refurbishment for some of its internal parts.

Analysts said that this marked the longest and most sortie-intensive exercise by the Chinese carrier in the region, displaying the PLA's capabilities to deal with potential US or Japanese intervention in the Taiwan question amid wrong remarks made by the two countries. The Shandong's maintenance started in late March, when the carrier set out from its homeport in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, sailed through the Taiwan Straits and then arrived at Dalian Shipyard, where the vessel was built, media reported at the time. If the Shandong returns to its homeport after maintenance, it could again transit through the Taiwan Straits, observers said.
