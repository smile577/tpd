The OSIRIS-REx team is led by Dr. Michael Drake, Director of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. will manage the mission for NASA. Lockheed Martin will build the spacecraft. \"This is a critical step in meeting the objectives outlined by President Obama to extend our reach beyond low-Earth orbit and explore into deep space,\" said NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden. \"Its robotic missions like these that will pave the way for future human space missions to an asteroid and other deep space destinations.\" The OSIRIS-REx mission is budgeted for approximately $800 million, excluding the launch vehicle. The target asteroid - named 1999 RQ36 after the year it was discovered - measures 575 meters (one-third of a mile) in diameter. 1999 RQ36 is a time capsule from the early solar system rich with organic compounds that may have seeded life on Earth. \"OSIRIS-REx will explore our past and help determine our destiny,\" said Drake. \"It will return samples of pristine organic material that scientists think might have seeded the sterile early Earth with the building blocks that led to life. Such samples do not currently exist on Earth. OSIRIS-REx will also provide the knowledge that will guide humanity in deflecting any future asteroid that could collide with Earth, allowing humanity to avoid the fate of the dinosaurs.\" OSIRIS-REx stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security -Regolith Explorer. Scheduled for launch in 2016, the OSIRIS-REx mission will return the first samples ever taken from a special type of asteroid holding clues to the origin of the solar system and likely organic molecules that may have seeded life on Earth. OSIRIS-REx will also investigate an object potentially hazardous to humanity. 1999 RQ36 has a one-in-1,800 chance of impacting the Earth in the year 2182. Spending over a year exploring 1999 RQ36 before acquiring samples, OSIRIS-REx will provide geologic context essential to expanding our understanding of the asteroid-comet continuum. The mission will provide near live coverage of 1999 RQ36 operations and sample return to Earth. Samples will return to Earth in the year 2023. The return to Earth of pristine samples with known geologic context will enable precise analyses that cannot be duplicated by spacecraft-based instruments. Pristine carbonaceous materials have never before been analyzed in laboratories on Earth. The Goddard Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory will be one of the first labs to receive the samples. \"The Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory is a state-of-the-art facility specializing in extremely sensitive techniques for detecting and characterizing amino acids and related biomolecules from natural samples such as meteorites, interplanetary dust particles - and now returned samples from one of the most interesting asteroids in the solar system,\" said Joe Nuth, OSIRIS-REx project scientist at NASA Goddard. The OSIRIS-REx instrument suite includes: the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite (OCAMS) by the University of Arizona; the OSIRIS REx Visible-Infrared Spectrometer (OVIRS) instrument by NASA Goddard; the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES) by Arizona State University; and the OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter (OLA) by the Canadian Space Agency.

OSIRIS-Rex will be the first US mission to collect and return samples of an asteroid to Earth. OSIRIS-Rex is planned for launch to the near Earth asteroid designated as 1999 RQ36 in September 2016 and will return up to four pounds of prisitine asteroidal material to Earth in 2023. The precious sample would land arrive at Utah's Test and Training Range in a sample return canister similar to the one for the Stardust spacecraft. \"We are absolutely delighted to announce the selection of OSIRIS-Rex,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, at a briefing for reporters. \"This asteroid is a time capsule from the birth of our solar system and ushers in a new era of planetary exploration. The knowledge from the mission also will help us to develop methods to better track the orbits of asteroids.\" OSIRIS-Rex is the acronym for Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security-Regolith Explorer. The asteroid is an unchanged remnant from the collapse of the solar nebula and birth of our solar system some 4.5 billion years ago, little altered over time. Asteroid 1999 RQ36 is likely rich in carbon, the key constituent of organic molecules and one of the building blocks of life. Organic molecules have been found in meteorite and comet samples, which indicates that some of life's ingredients can be created in space. The science team will determine if organics also are present on RQ36. Asteroids like 1999 RQ36 may have seeded Earth billions of years ago with organic molecules that are the building blocks of life and perhaps eventually led to living organisms. Samples from the asteroids may help scientists unlock the mysteries of the origin of life on Earth. Three years after launch, OSIRIS-Rex would arrive at Asteroid 1999 RQ36 in 2020 and study the 1900 foot wide space rock in detail for at least six months of comprehensive surface examinations with four science instruments. The science team will also use the time - perhaps up to one year - to look for the optimal place to touch the surface and collect a sample of at least two ounces of surface material with a robotic arm. \"We are bringing back what we believe is the type of material that led to the building blocks of life, that led to us,\" said Michael Drake, principal investigator of the OSIRIS-REx mission from the University of Arizona.\"We're going for something rich in organics, which might have had something to do with life getting started.\" \"OSIRIS-REx will explore our past and help determine our destiny,\" said Drake. \"It will return samples of pristine organic material that scientists think might have seeded the sterile early Earth with the building blocks that led to life. Such samples do not currently exist on Earth.

Drake added that the team will carefully practice the sample collection before conducting the actual retrieval of a surface material of a mixture of soil and rocks with a pogo stick like device. He said it would be more like \"kissing\" the surface than a actual landing of the spacecraft. The sampling device at the end of the robot arm looks like a car air filter. It will haul in the pristine regolith into the sample acquisition mechanism within 5 seconds in a \"touch and go\" maneuver as the spacecraft slowly descends at 0.1 m/sec.

That makes the space rock called 1999 RQ36 an irresistible target for NASA's upcoming robotic mission to retrieve samples. The $800 million mission, called OSIRIS-REx, aims to inject pure nitrogen into the asteroid and collect the dirt or gravel that gets stirred up. Anything collected by this \"inverse vacuum cleaner\" approach not only could give scientists a better idea about the odds of the asteroid striking Earth in 2170, currently put at 1-in-1,800, but might contain organic- and water-rich material similar to what possibly seeded early Earth with the ingredients for life. Such ingredients would make asteroids a tempting pit stop for future missions headed out beyond the inner solar system, said Joe Nuth, OSIRIS-REx project scientist at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"One day, probably beyond my lifetime, these types of asteroids might be seen as oases on the way out of the solar system,\" Nuth said. \"Human crews might stop there to get water and other interesting things.\" OSIRIS-REx is slated for launch in 2016 so that it can arrive at its target by 2020. Its samples would arrive on Earth in 2023. The probe's approach to 1999 RQ36 - a space rock a third of a mile (575 meters) wide - also could serve as a test run for future asteroid missions. \"We are effectively going to be a forerunner for anything we do on small bodies in the future,\" Nuth told scientists and engineers attending the International Academy of Astronautics' ninth Low-Cost Planetary Missions Conference here. \"As we send astronauts to the asteroids, this will help pioneer the navigation.\" Besides collecting rock samples, plans for the 400 days spent near 1999 RQ36 include mapping the inside and outside and investigating the chemistry and mineralogy. Scientists also want to measure the so-called Yarkovsky effect, which describes how asteroids gain a gentle push from emitting thermal radiation from their night side. The seven-year span between the launch and the arrival of the samples has led mission planners to set up a \"multigenerational team\" uniting experienced older scientists with younger scientists who can pick up the torch. The samples ought to prove objects of scientific curiosity for the next 100 years, Nuth said. Future instruments or technologies not yet invented may yield additional data down the line. \"We're opening up Apollo moon samples now that are being analyzed by techniques and asking questions that were not dreamed of when Apollo samples were brought back,\" Nuth said.

The mission's full name \"Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security-Regolith Explorer\", or OSIRIS-REx, will be the first US mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth. \"This is a critical step in meeting the objectives outlined by President Obama to extend our reach beyond low-Earth orbit and explore into deep space,\" said NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden. \"It's robotic missions like these that will pave the way for future human space missions to an asteroid and other deep space destinations.\" Currently, no asteroid destinations have been selected for human missions - past case studies in documentation in the 2009 Flexible Path presentation, while the official line continues to only reference the ambiguous \"sometime in the 2025 range\" as the timeframe for such a mission. However, the ambitious OSIRIS-Rex mission will be a step forward, not least because of the complicated mission profile of launch, rendezvous, \"landing\" and returning of a spacecraft from such a deep space target. A key element of the mission will be the rendezvous, with ASC's 3D Flash LIDAR cameras tasked with determining the spacecraft range to the asteroid surface, as well as evaluating the approach to potential sample sites. The 3D Flash LIDAR cameras are small form- factor, lightweight 3D depth cameras capable of capturing a full array of 128*128 independently triggered 3D range pixels with co-registered intensity per frame, up to 30 frames per second, allowing 3D range data streams to be generated in real-time, feeding the spacecraft guidance navigation and control systems. The cameras will be able to operate in the harsh deep space environments. This exciting technology has multiple applications, ranging from domestic to military - including Automotive, Defense, Surveillance, Robotics and Aviation - with ASC expanding its space-based applications since 2005. As the first 3D Flash LIDAR camera in space, ASC's DragonEye has already shown it is capable of real-time images without motion distortion, via its a non- mechanical camera and its eye-safe laser. The camera was tested by NASA Johnson Space Center under the Commercial Orbital Transport Services program on both STS-127 and STS-133 and is used by SpaceX Corporation's Dragon vehicle for autonomous guidance, navigation and control. ASC's 3D sensor engines are used by NASA Langley Research Center as the core 3D sensor for Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance efforts and by NASA JPL for its on-going development of Entry, Descent and Landing solutions. \"The DragonEye 3D Flash LIDAR camera opens many doors for 3D FLC in space, making both manned and unmanned AR&D possible,\" said Dr. Roger Stettner, President and CEO of ASC in 2011. \"We are pleased with what we've already been able to achieve with the DragonEye, and look forward to this next phase of product development which sets the stage for long term space use.\" Following launch - on a vehicle yet to be selected - the 3D Flash LIDAR will get to prove its value four years into the mission, as OSIRIS-REx approaches the primitive, near Earth asteroid. Once within three miles of the asteroid, the spacecraft will begin six months of comprehensive surface mapping. The science team then will pick a location from where the spacecraft's arm will take a sample, allowing the spacecraft to gradually move closer to the site for the arm to extend to collect more than two ounces of material for return to Earth in 2023. The mission, excluding the launch vehicle, is expected to cost approximately $800 million. \"The OSIRIS-REx sample return mission is of major importance in revealing the origin of volatiles and organics that led to life on Earth,\" said Dr. Dante Lauretta, the Principal Investigator overseeing the mission. \"Being able to accurately range to the asteroid surface during the 'touch and go' maneuver allows us to monitor the target profile and ensure that we are on a safe approach trajectory, with the possibility of multiple approaches if necessary. We welcome ASC's support to our project.\" OSIRIS-Rex's principal investigator is located at the University of Arizona. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, will provide overall mission management, systems engineering and safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx. Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver will build the spacecraft. \"ASC has worked with commercial companies and NASA's Langley, Johnson, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory for many years creating and enhancing a non-scanning 3D capture technology for space. We are confident this deep space version of a 3D Flash LIDAR camera will support the success of the OSIRIS-REx mission and assist this important project to deepen man's understanding of solar system origins,\" add Dr. Stettner. \"The high quality team assembled for this effort greatly increases the probability of success, making safe, deep-space vehicle operations a reality.\" On the return journey, the sample will be stored in a capsule for the long trip back to Earth, ahead of re-entry and a landing at Utah's Test and Training Range - where the Orion parachute testing is currently taking place - in 2023. The capsule's design will be similar to that used by NASA's Stardust spacecraft, which returned the world's first comet particles from comet Wild 2 in 2006. The OSIRIS-REx sample capsule will be taken to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. The material will be removed and delivered to a dedicated research facility following stringent planetary protection protocol. Precise analysis will be performed that cannot be duplicated by spacecraft-based instruments. RQ36 is approximately 1,900 feet in diameter or roughly the size of five football fields. The asteroid, little altered over time, is likely to represent a snapshot of our solar system's infancy. The asteroid also is likely rich in carbon, a key element in the organic molecules necessary for life. Organic molecules have been found in meteorite and comet samples, indicating some of life's ingredients can be created in space. Scientists want to see if they also are present on RQ36. \"This asteroid is a time capsule from the birth of our solar system and ushers in a new era of planetary exploration,\" said Jim Green, director, NASA's Planetary Science Division in Washington. \"The knowledge from the mission also will help us to develop methods to better track the orbits of asteroids.\" The mission will accurately measure the \"Yarkovsky effect\" for the first time. The effect is a small push caused by the sun on an asteroid, as it absorbs sunlight and re-emits that energy as heat. The small push adds up over time, but it is uneven due to an asteroid's shape, wobble, surface composition and rotation. For scientists to predict an Earth-approaching asteroid's path, they must understand how the effect will change its orbit. OSIRIS-REx will help refine RQ36's orbit to ascertain its trajectory and devise future strategies to mitigate possible Earth impacts from celestial objects. The OSIRIS-REx payload includes instruments from the University of Arizona, Goddard, Arizona State University in Tempe and the Canadian Space Agency. NASA's Ames Research Center, the Langley Research Center, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also are involved. The science team is composed of numerous researchers from universities, private and government agencies.

This Yarkovsky effect, as it's called, is caused when sunlight is absorbed and re-emitted as heat. Now scientists have measured the precise change in an asteroid's orbit caused by this. Asteroid 1999 RQ36 is about one-third of a mile wide (0.5 km). Its path around the sun has been altered by about 100 miles (160 km) over the past 12 years due to the Yarkovsky effect, the study finds. The orbit of the space rock - which crosses Earth's path, presenting the remote chance of a future collision - was measured by the ground-based Arecibo and Goldstone radar stations in 1999 and 2005. Last September, another set of observations revealed the orbital change. The Yarkovsky effect is named for a 19th-century Russian engineer who first proposed the idea that a small rocky space object would, over long periods of time, be noticeably nudged in its orbit by the slight push created when it absorbs sunlight and then re-emits that energy as heat. The tiny effect is difficult to measure. \"The Yarkovsky force on 1999 RQ36 at its peak, when the asteroid is nearest the sun, is only about a half-ounce - about the weight of three grapes on Earth,\" said study team member Steven Chesley of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"Meanwhile, the mass of the asteroid is estimated to be about 68 million tons. You need extremely precise measurements over a fairly long time span to see something so slight acting on something so huge.\" Because asteroid 1999 RQ36 hangs out in the vicinity of Earth, and could someday threaten to hit the planet, scientists are curious where its changing orbit will take it in the future. Chesley and his colleagues used the new measurements to show that the asteroid passed (or will pass) within 4.6 million miles (7.5 million km) of Earth 11 times from the years 1654 to 2135. In 2135, the space rock will make its closest brush with us, swinging by Earth at about 220,000 miles (350,000 km) away. That's closer than the moon, which orbits about 240,000 miles from Earth. What happens after that gets harder to predict. \"The new results don't really change what is qualitatively known about the probability of future impacts,\" Chesley said. \"The odds of this potentially hazardous asteroid colliding with Earth late in the 22nd century are still calculated to be about one in a few thousand.\" NASA plans to launch the OSIRIS-Rex mission in 2016 to collect a sample from 1999 RQ36 and return it to Earth. Chesley presented the findings May 19 at the Asteroids, Comets and Meteors 2012 meeting in Niigata, Japan.

NASA's Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft will visit the asteroid now called Bennu, named after an important ancient Egyptian avian deity. OSIRIS-Rex is scheduled to launch in 2016, rendezvous with Bennu in 2018 and return a sample of the asteroid to Earth in 2023. The name for the carbon-rich asteroid, designated in the scientific community as (101955) 1999 RQ36, is the winning entry in an international student contest. Nine-year-old Michael Puzio suggested the name because he imagined the Touch-and-Go Sample Mechanism (TAGSAM) arm and solar panels on OSIRIS-REx look like the neck and wings in drawings of Bennu, which Egyptians usually depicted as a gray heron. Puzio wrote the name suits the asteroid because it means \"the ascending one,\" or \"to shine.\" TAGSAM will collect a sample from Bennu and store it for return to Earth. The sample could hold clues to the origin of the solar system and the source of water and organic molecules that may have contributed to the development of life on Earth. The mission will be a vital part of NASA's plans to find, study, capture and relocate an asteroid for exploration by astronauts. NASA recently announced an asteroid initiative proposing a strategy to leverage human and robotic activities for the first human mission to an asteroid while also accelerating efforts to improve detection and characterization of asteroids. \"There were many excellent entries that would be fitting names and provide us an opportunity to educate the world about the exciting nature of our mission,\" said Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona in Tucson, a contest judge and the principal investigator of the OSIRIS-REx mission. \"The information about the composition of Bennu and the nature of its orbit will enable us to explore our past and better understand our future.\" More than 8,000 students, all younger than 18, from more than 25 countries worldwide entered the \"Name that Asteroid!\" contest last year. Each contestant submitted one name with a maximum of 16 characters and a short explanation for the name. The contest was a partnership with The Planetary Society in Pasadena, Calif.; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Mass.; and the University of Arizona. The partners assembled a panel to review the submissions and submit a top choice to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Committee for Small Body Nomenclature. The IAU is the governing body that officially names a celestial object. \"Bennu struck a chord with many of us right away,\" said Bruce Betts, director of projects for the Planetary Society and a contest judge. \"While there were many great entries, the similarity between the image of the heron and the TAGSAM arm of OSIRIS-REx was a clever choice. The parallel with asteroids as both bringers of life and as destructive forces in the solar system also created a great opportunity to teach.\" The Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research Program survey team discovered the asteroid in 1999, early in NASA's Near-Earth Objects Observation Program, which detects and catalogs near-Earth asteroids and comets. \"The samples of Bennu returned by OSIRIS-REx will allow scientists to peer into the origin of the solar system and gain insights into the origin of life,\" said Jason Dworkin, an OSIRIS-REx project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

The main goal of the OSIRIS-REx mission will be to gather and return to Earth up to two kilograms of material from the surface of the primitive asteroid Bennu (previously known as 1999 RQ36). Prior to collecting the sample, the spacecraft will also carry out extensive imaging and spectral analysis of the surface and by mapping the gravity field investigate the interior structure. Chesley proposes to send a second spacecraft, named ISIS, to Bennu that would perform a high speed crash on the surface. You may remember that the Deep Impact spacecraft similarly delivered an impact projectile to comet Tempel 1. That mission was partially skunked when the dust cloud raised by the collision prevented the main spacecraft from imaging the resulting crater, whose size and shape would have provided important clues about the structure of comets. (A second spacecraft later imaged the crater.) Under Chesley's plan, the impact would occur while the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft lingers (at a safe distance) near Bennu following its initial study and the collection of the samples. At the time of the impact, the OSIRIS-REx cameras would watch the cloud of ejected material for clues to the composition and size of the blocks of material making up the surface. Once the ejecta had safely dissipated, OSIRIS-REx would move in for a close look at the ISIS impact crater to examine the composition of Bennu a few meters below the surface. The spacecraft would also remap the asteroid surface to see what changes occurred as the result of the seismic shock created by the impact, which will help us understand the role impacts have in shaping the surface of small bodies. (There is no plan to risk the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft by having it sample within the newly created crater.) While the impact would further our scientific exploration of asteroids, the ISIS mission also would contribute to other goals. If astronomers discover an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, one idea would be to send an spacecraft to change the asteroid's trajectory through a high speed impact. Small asteroids like Bennu are believed to be rubble piles, and it's difficult to model how an impact would affect an asteroid's trajectory. The OSIRIS-REx mission team would measure Bennu's trajectory before and after the impact to determine the resulting minuscule change in Bennu's orbit about the sun. This would help us better understand whether future impactors could divert asteroids from collision courses with the Earth. NASA also has goals to send humans to explore small near Earth asteroids like Bennu. Before astronauts arrive, the space agency would like to better understand these bodies' surface mechanical properties, their local and global stability, and the environment of small particles likely to surround them. The ISIS impact experiment would further our understanding in all three areas. For those who don't remember their ancient Egyptian mythology, Osiris was a god ruler of Egypt. Following his murder and dismemberment, his wife and queen Isis gathered together his scattered body parts and resurrected him. While there's no murder in this story, the proposed ISIS mission would be enabled by taking advantage of various existing components. First, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will be at Bennu and will have several months available in its schedule to watch the impact and study the aftermath. The 2016 InSight Mars mission provides an option to launch ISIS at negligible additional cost on an orbit would take it twice past Mars and then to Bennu. The ISIS spacecraft itself would be built around an adapter ring designed to mate a main spacecraft to its launch vehicle and also provide attach points for small secondary spacecraft. The components needed to turn the adapter ring into a spacecraft - electronics, solar panels, propulsion, and a camera that would be used to track Bennu - would take the place of the secondary spacecraft. The final collision would be enabled by a JPL-developed AutoNav system, has been used for five previous NASA comet encounters, that would image Bennu in the final hours and steer the spacecraft to an impact.

NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, manages New Frontiers for the agency's Science Mission Directorate. OSIRIS-REx complements NASA's Asteroid Initiative, which aligns portions of the agency's science, space technology and human exploration capabilities in a coordinated asteroid research effort. The initiative will conduct research and analysis to better characterize and mitigate the threat these space rocks pose to our home planet. Included in the initiative is NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), a robotic spacecraft mission that will capture a boulder from the surface of a near-Earth asteroid and move it into a stable orbit around the moon for exploration by astronauts, all in support of advancing the nation's journey to Mars. The agency also is engaging new industrial capabilities, partnerships, open innovation and participatory exploration through the NASA Asteroid Initiative. NASA also has made tremendous progress in the cataloging and characterization of near Earth objects over the past five years. The president's NASA budget included, and Congress authorized, $20.4 million for an expanded NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) Observations Program, increasing the resources for this critical program from the $4 million per year it had received since the 1990s. The program was again expanded in fiscal year 2014, with a budget of $40.5 million. NASA is asking Congress for $50 million for this important work in the 2016 budget. NASA has identified more than 12,000 NEOs to date, including 96 percent of near-Earth asteroids larger than 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) in size. NASA has not detected any objects of this size that pose an impact hazard to Earth in the next 100 years. Smaller asteroids do pass near Earth, however, and some could pose an impact threat. In 2011, 893 near-Earth asteroids were found. In 2014, that number was increased to 1,472. In addition to NASA's ongoing work detecting and cataloging asteroids, the agency has engaged the public in the hunt for these space rocks through the agency's Asteroid Grand Challenge activities, including prize competitions. During the recent South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, the agency announced the release of a software application based on an algorithm created by a NASA challenge that has the potential to increase the number of new asteroid discoveries by amateur astronomers.

Approximately 17 months from now, OSIRIS-REx is slated to launch in the fall of 2016 and visit asteroid Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid. Bennu is a near-Earth asteroid and was selected for the sample return mission because it \"could hold clues to the origin of the solar system and host organic molecules that may have seeded life on Earth,\" says NASA. The spacecraft is equipped with a suite of five science instruments to remotely study the 492 meter meter wide asteroid. Eventually it will gather rocks and soil and bring at least a 60-gram (2.1-ounce) sample back to Earth in 2023 for study by researchers here with all the most sophisticated science instruments available.

Only three Atlas V's have been launched in this configuration. \"In just over 500 days, we will begin our seven-year journey to Bennu and back. This is an exciting time,\" said Lauretta. The spacecraft will reach Bennu in 2018 and return a sample to Earth in 2023. Bennu is an unchanged remnant from the collapse of the solar nebula and birth of our solar system some 4.5 billion years ago, little altered over time. Significant progress in spacecraft assembly has already been accomplished at Lockheed's Denver manufacturing facility. \"The spacecraft structure has been integrated with the propellant tank and propulsion system and is ready to begin system integration in the Lockheed Martin highbay,\" said Mike Donnelly, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, in a statement. \"The payload suite of cameras and sensors is well into its environmental test phase and will be delivered later this summer/fall.\" OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA's New Frontiers Program, following New Horizons to Pluto and Juno to Jupiter, which also launched on Atlas V rockets.

The Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism is the device that satisfies all sample-acquisition requirements. TAGSAM consists of two major components: a sampler head and an articulated positioning arm. The head acquires the bulk sample by releasing a jet of high-purity N2 gas that \"fluidizes\" the regolith into the collection chamber. The articulated arm positions the head for collection, brings it back for visual documentation, and places it in the Stardust-heritage Sample Return Capsule. During this final phase of system development, we are simultaneously building two TAGSAM units: the flight unit and the qualification unit. The two units are identical in every way. The qualification unit is put through a series of tests to verify that it meets all mission requirements. The flight unit will only see the tests after it is integrated onto the spacecraft and is kept in a clean location throughout most of ATLO. The first tests for the TAGSAM qualification unit are the functional tests. These tests demonstrate the complete range of motion for the arm at a nominal voltage (the spacecraft voltage will vary over the course of the mission, depending on the power from the solar arrays). In order to compensate for the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth, we have to offload the arm. We achieve this using a Big Arial Balloon (BAB), which is exactly what it sounds like - a giant balloon filled with Helium and attached via a ground-support fixture to the TAGSAM arm. We just recently completed TAGSAM arm deployments on the BAB with full alignments and load cell measurements. We have also completed the launch cover deployment test, which verifies that the protective cover can be ejected from the spacecraft, once we arrive at Bennu. We are now preparing for vibration testing, thermal cycling, and restraint release testing. In parallel to these activities, the team is building the flight SRC. With the components in house, we have updated the SRC mass properties and shown that the SRC is spin balanced, allowing for stable passage through the atmosphere during re-entry. This test is also used to verify that the g-switches activate at the appropriate time during the descent through the atmosphere. These switches sense when we have reached a critical deceleration and then release the parachute. They are thus critical to the safe delivery of Bennu samples to Earth. We are also finalizing the test configuration for our SRC separation test, which verifies that the spacecraft can release the SRC and target the correct atmospheric entry point.

OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer, is the first U.S. mission to take a sample from an asteroid and bring it to Earth for study. OSIRIS-REx will travel to Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid, to bring back a small sample to Earth for study. The mission is scheduled for launch in September 2016. The spacecraft will reach its asteroid target in 2018 and return a sample to Earth in 2023. \"These instruments are essential to accomplishing the mission's science goals and unlocking the secrets of Bennu,\" said Dante Lauretta, professor in the UA's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory and principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx. \"I am proud of the dedication to excellence that each of our instrument teams brings to this mission, and I look forward to all that we will discover at the asteroid.\" The spacecraft will carry five instruments from national and international partners. These instruments will be key to mapping and analyzing Bennu's surface and will be critical in identifying a site from which a sample can be safely retrieved and ultimately returned to Earth. The OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite, or OCAMS, consists of three cameras that will image Bennu during approach and proximity operations. Scientists and engineers at LPL designed and built OCAMS to image Bennu over nine orders of magnitude in distance, from 1 million kilometers (more than 620,000 miles) down to two meters (6.5 feet). PolyCam, the largest camera of the OCAMS suite, is both a telescope - acquiring the asteroid from far away while it is still a point of light - and a microscope capable of scrutinizing the pebbles on Bennu's surface. MapCam will map the entire surface of Bennu from a distance of three miles, and the Sampling Camera, or SamCam, is designed to document the sample acquisition. The OCAMS instrument suite is scheduled to be installed on the spacecraft in September. The OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter, or OLA, will scan Bennu to map the entire asteroid surface, producing local and global topographic maps. OLA is a contributed instrument from the Canadian Space Agency. The OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or OTES, will conduct surveys to map mineral and chemical abundances and to take Bennu's temperature. OTES is provided by Arizona State University. The OSIRIS-REx Visible and Infrared Spectrometer, or OVIRS, measures visible and infrared light from Bennu, which can be used to identify water and organic materials. The instrument is provided by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. A student experiment called the Regolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, or REXIS, will map elemental abundances on the asteroid. REXIS is a collaboration between the students and faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard College Observatory. \"This is an exciting time for the project,\" said Mike Donnelly, OSIRIS-REx project manager, from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Years of effort are coming to culmination with the upcoming deliveries of the instruments to the spacecraft.\" NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt provides overall mission management, systems engineering and safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx.

Goddard built the instrument. OVIRS, a point spectrometer, will split the light from the asteroid Bennu into its component wavelengths, similar to a prism that splits sunlight into a rainbow, but over a much broader range of wavelengths. Different chemicals have unique spectral signatures by absorbing sunlight and can be identified in the reflected spectrum. The spectra provided by the instrument will help guide sample site selection. \"Through the team's efforts, OVIRS has become a remarkably capable instrument which we expect to return exciting science from the asteroid, Bennu,\" said Dennis Reuter, OVIRS instrument lead from Goddard. After thorough testing with the spacecraft on the ground, the instrument will be powered on for check-out shortly after launch, with first science data collected during the Earth gravity assist in September 2017. OSIRIS-REx is the first U.S. mission to return samples from an asteroid to Earth for study. The mission is scheduled for launch in September 2016. It will reach its asteroid target in 2018 and return a sample to Earth in 2023. The spacecraft will travel to a near-Earth asteroid, called Bennu and bring at least a 2.1-ounce sample back to Earth for study. The mission will help scientists investigate the composition of the very early solar system and the source of organic materials and water that made their way to Earth, and improve understanding of asteroids that could impact our planet. \"The delivery of OVIRS to the spacecraft means the mission now has the capability to measure the minerals and chemicals at the sample site on Bennu,\" said Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx at the University of Arizona, Tucson. \"I greatly appreciate the hard work and innovation the OVIRS team demonstrated during the creation of this instrument.\" NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, provides overall mission management, systems engineering and safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx.

Scheduled to launch in 2016, the mission has passed a couple of key milestones already this summer. It recently completed its Mission Operations Review, demonstrating the team's progress in developing the procedures to execute the complicated activities needed to return a sample from an asteroid. In July, 2015, the mission received its second instrument at Lockheed Martin, for installation onto the spacecraft. The instrument is the Visible and Infrared Spectrometer, and it's designed to analyze visible and near-infrared light from the asteroid, enabling it to discern the presence of water and organic material. The Goddard Space Flight Center designed and built this new OVIRS instrument. Its job will be to split the light from the asteroid Bennu into its component wavelengths. This process - reminiscent of what an ordinary prism does when it refracts or splits sunlight into an array of colors - will cover a wide scope of wavelengths and identify the unique spectral signatures of chemical elements within the asteroid. Researchers will use the results of the spectral analysis to decide on the appropriate area to collect geological samples from Bennu. Dennis Reuter, OVIRS instrument lead, said in a July 8 statement to NASA : Through the team's efforts, OVIRS has become a remarkably capable instrument which we expect to return exciting science from asteroid Bennu. Mike Donnelly, OSIRIS-REx project manager, said: The OVIRS team has met all of their technical requirements. This is another step in completing the spacecraft and sending it on its way to rendezvous > with the asteroid Bennu. OSIRIS-Rex is the first mission by the United States that will return samples from an asteroid. The mission, scheduled to launch in September of 2016, is expected to reach its target in 2018 and return back to Earth in 2023. The near-Earth asteroid Bennu has a diameter of 538 yards. NASA's LINEAR project discovered it on September 11, 1999. It is named for a bird of Egyptian mythology. Bennu was selected for study for several reasons. A primary reason is that Bennu is a near-Earth object. We on Earth have become increasingly aware that asteroids can and sometimes do strike our planet, and Bennu is one of those objects that has a potential to do so. The next time of a potential strike by Bennu is late in the 22nd century. Bennu completes an orbit around the sun every 436.604 days and every 6 years comes very close to Earth, within 0.002 Astronomical Units. For a sample return mission like OSIRIS-REx, the easiest asteroids to visit are those in orbits similar to Bennu. Plus we want to visit those asteroids, to explore and expand about capability for landing on potentially hazardous asteroids and hopefully redirecting their orbits.

Once there, its versatile focus mechanism will transform the camera from a telescope to a microscope, enabling it to examine tiny rocks while only hundreds of meters from the asteroid's surface. This camera, called PolyCam, is part of an innovative suite of three cameras designed and built by the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL). Together, these cameras will enable the OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return mission to map the asteroid Bennu, choose a sample site, and ensure that the sample is correctly stowed on the spacecraft. The University of Arizona delivered the OSIRIS-REx CAMera Suite (OCAMS) instrument to Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Littleton, Colorado, today for integration onto the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. \"The OCAMS instrument's three cameras, PolyCam, MapCam and SamCam, will be our mission's eyes at Bennu,\" said Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx at the University of Arizona. \"OCAMS will provide the imagery we need to complete our mission while the spacecraft is at the asteroid.\" The largest of the three cameras, PolyCam, is small telescope that will acquire the first images of Bennu from two million kilometers distance and provide high resolution imaging of the sample site. MapCam will search for satellites and outgassing plumes around Bennu, map the asteroid in color, and provide images to construct topographic maps. SamCam will document the sample acquisition event and the collected sample. \"The most important goal of these cameras is to maximize our ability to successfully return a sample,\" said OCAMS instrument scientist Bashar Rizk. \"Our mission requires a lot of activities during one trip - navigation, mapping, reconnaissance, sample site selection, and sampling. While we are there, we need the ability to continuously see what is happening around the asteroid in order to make real-time decisions.\" The OSIRIS-REx mission is scheduled to launch in September 2016 to study Bennu, a near-Earth and potentially hazardous asteroid. After rendezvousing with Bennu in 2018, the spacecraft will survey the asteroid, obtain a sample, and return it to Earth. OSIRIS-REx is the first U.S. mission to sample an asteroid, and will return the largest sample from space since the Apollo lunar missions. Scientists expect that Bennu may hold clues to the origin of the solar system and the source of water and organic molecules that may have seeded life on Earth. Bennu also has a relatively high probability of impacting the Earth late in the 22nd century. OSIRIS-REx's investigation will inform future efforts to develop a mission to mitigate an impact, should one be required. \"This is another major step in preparing for our mission,\" said Mike Donnelly, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"With the delivery of OCAMS to the spacecraft contractor, we will have our full complement of cameras and spectrometers,\" While SamCam and MapCam were made exclusively by LPL, PolyCam's optics and structure were made through a joint program between LPL and the University of Arizona's College of Optical Sciences.

The launch window for OSIRIS-REx opens next fall on September 3, 2016 on a seven-year journey to asteroid Bennu and back. Bennu is a carbon-rich asteroid. OSIRIS-Rex will eventually return the largest sample from space since the American and Soviet Union's moon landing missions of the 1970s.

OSIRIS-REx is scheduled for launch in September 2016 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 411 rocket, which includes a 4-meter diameter payload fairing and one solid rocket motor. Only three Atlas V's have been launched in this configuration. \"This is an exciting time,\" says Lauretta. The spacecraft will reach Bennu in 2018. OSIRIS-REx will gather rocks and soil and bring at least a 60-gram (2.1-ounce) sample back to Earth in 2023 for study by researchers here with all the most sophisticated science instruments available. Bennu is an unchanged remnant from the collapse of the solar nebula and birth of our solar system some 4.5 billion years ago, little altered over time. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA's New Frontiers Program, following New Horizons to Pluto and Juno to Jupiter, which also launched on Atlas V rockets. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is responsible for overall mission management.

First up is the lift-off of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, scheduled for Sept. 8 at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The United Launch Alliance Atlas V, assembled in Decatur, will boost the explorer on its way to the near-Earth asteroid Bennu. The spacecraft will travel to the asteroid, survey it to produce 3-D maps and bring back a sample of surface material for study. NASA says the mission - the first involving a round-trip to an asteroid - will help scientists investigate how planets formed and life began. \"This mission exemplifies our nation's quest to boldly go and study our solar system and beyond to better understand the universe and our place in it,\" said Geoff Yoder, a NASA administrator in Washington, D.C. The spacecraft should reach Bennu in 2018 and return the sample via a detachable capsule in 2023. This week, the OSIRIS-REx was bolted onto the Alabama-made Atlas V on Pad 41 at Cape Canaveral in preparation for lift-off. NASA said the launch should not be affected by Thursday's SpaceX rocket explosion on a nearby pad. ULA's Atlas V Solid Rocket Booster is lifted and stationed onto the stand at Pad 41 for the upcoming OSIRIS-REx launch. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft being transported to the launch pad, where it was bolted to the Atlas V rocket for lift-off. On Aug. 25, NASA's Launch Services Program announced that ULA's Atlas V will launch Mars 2020 on its mission to the Red Planet. Lift-off is planned for July 2020 from Cape Canaveral, and the spacecraft should reach Mars in 2021. The Mars 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site and determine the habitability of the environment. It will also search for signs of ancient Martian life, and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers. United Launch Alliance rockets have launched NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers to Mars, and will launch its next rover in 2018 as well. \"Our launch vehicles have a rich heritage with Mars, supporting 17 successful missions over more than 50 years,\" said Laura Maginnis, ULA's vice president of Custom Services. \"ULA and our heritage rockets have launched every U.S. spacecraft to the Red Planet, including Mars Science Lab, as well as the Spirit and Opportunity rovers.\" ULA's Alabama assembly facility is the sole production site for Atlas V and Delta IV rockets, which launch payloads for NASA and other government agencies. The 1.6 million- square-foot Decatur factory employs around 1,000 people. Versions of the Atlas V can stand 205 feet tall, rising to almost 19 stories. The engines of an Alabama-made Atlas V rocket roar to life on a 2016 mission for NASA. An Alabama-made Atlas V will launch NASA's next Mars lander, called inSight, in 2018. The surface explorer aims to provide understanding of the processes that shaped the planets of the inner solar system, including Earth. There's another Alabama connection to two of these missions. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA's New Frontiers Program, which is managed by Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. InSight is part of NASA's Discovery program, also managed by Marshall.

OSIRIS-REx blasted off from Cape Canaveral on September 8, being sent on its way by an Atlas V rocket in a flawless one-hour ascent mission. Completing its first steps in space, the spacecraft set sail on a long journey of seven years comprised of a two-year link-up with the asteroid, a three-year stay to study and sample Bennu, and a two-year return trip to deliver up to two Kilograms of material from the asteroid's surface. Within minutes of separating from its carrier rocket, OSIRIS-REx headed into a multi-week campaign dedicated to checkouts and reconfigurations beginning with the critical deployment of the craft's solar arrays. Talking to the spacecraft via NASA's Deep Space Network, controllers verified that OSIRIS-REx was healthy, charging its batteries and actively maintaining its attitude. Two days of extensive checkouts of the spacecraft platform's core systems were completed before OSIRIS-REx was transitioned from an initial Safe Mode into its Outbound Cruise Mode, also marking a major attitude control system transition from inertial pointing to a Sun-Earth Pointed orientation. By the end of September 11, OSIRIS-REx had departed Earth's Sphere of Influence with the sun now the primary body with respect to gravitational forces acting upon it. To verify the operation of the spacecraft's Star Trackers, teams downlinked an image from one of the trackers on September 12. Normally, Star Tracker images are analyzed on board and not sent to the ground, but that function is available for testing purposes. Ranging of the spacecraft provided a precise fix on its outbound trajectory, showing Atlas V performed a very precise injection with no need for any immediate correction maneuvers. A week after launch, OSIRIS-REx had traveled over 15 million Kilometers relative to the sun and was three million Kilometers from Earth. Over the course of the next week, teams powered up the OSIRIS-REx instrument suite for basic electrical and functional checks to ensure all payloads made it through launch in good health. OCAMS - the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite - saw first light on September 17, delivering images of a star field in Taurus, near the constellation Orion. These images showcase the differences between the different OCAMS components with MapCam delivering a wide field of the star field and PolyCam covering only a narrow corridor but capturing many faint stars MapCam can not detect. At the asteroid, PolyCam will be in use for long-range imaging on approach and ultra-close-ups when in orbit while MapCam delivers global imagery of Bennu. Next to be powered up was the OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter that went through test sequences and performed a test firing of its laser that will be put to use for detailed topographic measurements of the asteroid. The Visible & Infrared, and Thermal Infrared Spectrometers known as OVIRS and OTES were separately powered for testing and both showed excellent instrument performance. REXIS - the sole student-built instrument of the mission - checked off its functional tests without problems and is ready to study the asteroid in X-ray vision. The activation of the Touch and Go Camera System (TAGCAMS) and its checkout yielded a photo of the spacecraft's Sample Return Capsule that is set for a long ride to asteroid Bennu and back ahead of a speedy re-entry to deliver the mission's sample to Earth for laboratory analysis. The camera pointed at the capsule, known as StowCam, will have the important task of documenting the handoff between the TAGSAM sampling arm and the capsule, ensuring the sample canister is secured in place inside the capsule before releasing the arm and closing the capsule. Last Friday, OSIRIS-REx executed its first Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM) that was primarily dedicated to testing the Trajectory Control System thrusters, six of which are installed on the spacecraft. The maneuver changed the spacecraft's speed by 0.5 meters per second and lasted only 12 seconds, providing valuable data on the operation of the engines was well as the spacecraft in the attitude control mode selected for engine firings. Originally, TCM-1 was budgeted with 11 Kilograms of propellant to change the spacecraft's velocity by up to 11.6 meters per second to correct any insertion errors by Atlas V. With a very accurate injection, OSIRIS-REx only consumed 0.5kg of Hydrazine, adding to the mission's propellant margin and increasing the flexibility of operations at the target asteroid. OSIRIS-REx hosts a sophisticated propulsion system with four different types of thrusters - six 22-Newton TCM Thrusters used on Friday, 16 Attitude Control Thrusters in use since separation from the Atlas V, a pair of Low Thrust Reaction Engine Assembly (LTR) thrusters to be used for the asteroid sampling, and four large 275N main engines that will come into play for the first time in December. In the near-term, the OSIRIS-REx mission team will begin preparing for the critical Deep Space Maneuvers in December that will set the spacecraft on a course for its September 2017 Earth Gravity Assist Flyby. The Flyby is needed to bend the spacecraft's trajectory to match the inclination of Bennu's orbit ahead of a mid-2018 link-up. The Earth Flyby also provides an opportunity to exercise the mission's instruments, verifying their performance in the known near-Earth environment where communications delay is not an issue. Visiting a carbon-rich asteroid is a top priority for scientists since asteroids are considered relics from the early stage of the Solar System, carrying a record of the conditions 4.5 billion years ago and possibly holding clues that could reveal how the building blocks for life were delivered to Earth and, possibly, other places in the Solar System. Bennu, the mission's target asteroid, is a dark, unexplored world roaming the inner solar system in an orbit taking 1.2 years for one lap around the sun. The primary goal of the mission is to collect a surface sample from asteroid Bennu, and return as much as two Kilograms of material to Earth in a pristine Sample Return Capsule. Obtaining an untouched sample from Bennu and putting it through laboratory tests not possible with spacecraft instruments will reveal ultra-trace amounts of organic compounds to help in understanding the origin of the ingredients for life as we now know it on Earth.", "url": "https://spaceflight101.com/osiris-rex/outbound-osiris-rex-asteroid-explorer-passes-instrument-checks-adjusts-flight-path/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx aces Deep Space Maneuver, to Search for Trojan Asteroids in February", "date": "2017-01-19", "content": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Spacecraft aced its first Deep Space Maneuver on December 28, 2016 and is now lined up for a planned September 2017 flyby of Earth that will alter the spacecraft's path to enable it to link up with Asteroid Bennu in 2018 for an ambitious mission of discovery. The success of the Deep Space Maneuver was confirmed by NASA on Wednesday after sufficient tracking data was gathered from the spacecraft following the Dec. 28 main engine firing. The large maneuver changed the spacecraft's speed by 431 meters per second and the vehicle's MR-107S main engines consumed 354 Kilograms of Hydrazine fuel, propelling the asteroid explorer with a thrust of 112 Kilogram-force. After completion of the maneuver, OSIRIS-REx sent back telemetry data recorded during the firing, indicating all went well with the critical engine burn, but teams had to track the spacecraft's trajectory for several days to fully confirm the maneuver had placed the vehicle onto the correct path. \"DSM-1 was our first major trajectory change and first use of the main engines, so it's good to have that under our belts and be on a safe trajectory to Bennu,\" said Arlin Bartels OSIRIS-REx deputy project maneuver at the Goddard Spaceflight Center. After completion of the Deep Space Maneuver, OSIRIS-REx powered up its High Gain Antenna for the first time for a checkout. While still in close proximity to Earth after its September 8 liftoff from Cape Canaveral, OSIRIS-REx used its Low and Medium-Gain Antennas - the High-Gain Antenna is required at greater distances to achieve a meaningful data rate for the exchange of science/telemetry data and telecommands. The mission plans to switch primary communications over to the High-Gain Antenna later in January. At 18: 06 UTC on Wednesday (Jan. 18), OSIRIS-REx completed a successful Trajectory Correction Maneuver with its smaller thrusters, cleaning up after last month's Deep Space Maneuver to fine-tune the spacecraft's trajectory toward the Earth flyby. But before OSIRIS-REx is inbound to Earth, an interesting addition was made to its mission - searching for Trojan asteroids inhabiting Earth's orbit around the sun. Trojans are constant companions to planets in the solar system, traveling around the sun 60 degrees in front and behind the planet in what is known as the 4th and 5th Lagrangian Points - stable points in space where the gravitational pull of the sun and the planet provide precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. The first three Lagrange points are on a line connecting the two principal bodies and are considered semi-stable while the 4th & 5th points are stable - allowing objects to remain at these points indefinitely if there are no other forces acting on them. Six planets in the solar system are known to have Trojans, Jupiter leads the pack with over 6,000 known Trojan Asteroids. To date, there is only one known Earth Trojan - 2010 TK7, discovered in 2010 by NASA's NEOWISE project. Scientists predict there to be many more Trojans leading and trailing Earth, but their detection is extremely difficult from a vantage point near Earth as they appear very close to the sun. OSIRIS-REx - no longer bound to Earth and in an independent orbit around the sun - will have a unique chance to spot leading Trojans in a narrow window of opportunity in mid-February that places the outbound spacecraft in the ideal position to spot Trojans. Over 12 days from February 9 through 20, OSIRIS-REx will employ its MapCam imager to methodically scan the area where the Trojans must be located. This out-of-this-world search effort is also a welcome opportunity to rehearse for surveying operations at the mission's target asteroid where OSIRIS-REx will be on the lookout for possible natural satellites around the large rocky body. \"The Earth-Trojan asteroid search provides a substantial advantage to the OSIRIS-REx mission,\" said OSIRIS-REx Principal Investigator Dante Lauretta. \"Not only do we have the opportunity to discover new members of an asteroid class, but more importantly, we are practicing critical mission operations in advance of our arrival at Bennu, which ultimately reduces mission risk.\" After its search for Trojans, OSIRIS-REx will quietly continue on its cruise, making one lap around the sun before being inbound again for the September 22 Earth flyby. The flyby, targeting an altitude of around 20,000 Kilometers, is designed to bend the spacecraft's trajectory, modifying its orbital inclination to six degrees in order to match Bennu's inclination. The Asteroid Approach Phase will start in mid-August 2018 when Bennu will start growing in the spacecraft's telescopic camera from just a speck of light. Major rendezvous burns will slow down the spacecraft for arrival in the vicinity of Bennu in November 2018 to initiate a year-long surveying phase during which the spacecraft will orbit the asteroid at different distances. Several rehearsals will be held before OSIRIS-REx will commit to a touch-and-go maneuver to hopefully collect up to two Kilograms of sample material from Bennu. Per the current plan, OSIRIS-REx is expected back on Earth in September 2023 after a seven-year journey. However, teams could opt for any earlier return to get their hands on the mission's sample a full year ahead of schedule. Bennu, the mission's target asteroid, is a dark, unexplored world roaming the inner solar system in an orbit taking 1.2 years for one lap around the sun. Visiting a carbon-rich asteroid was a top priority for scientists since asteroids are considered relics from the early stage of the Solar System, carrying a record of the conditions 4.5 billion years ago and possibly holding clues that could reveal how the building blocks for life were delivered to Earth and, possibly, other places in the Solar System. Around 500 meters across, Bennu grazes past Earth every six years and is one of a few known asteroids that are considered potential Earth impactors. An impact of Bennu in the next century and beyond can not be ruled out due to minute variations in its flight path caused by external influences from the sun - an effect to be studied by OSIRIS-REx to better calculate the path other threatening asteroids will take.", "url": "https://spaceflight101.com/osiris-rex/osiris-rex-aces-deep-space-maneuver/"}, {"title": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx probe moonlights as asteroid sleuth", "date": "2017-02-01", "content": "On course to collect specimens from asteroid Bennu after its launch last year, NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will search this month for objects sharing an orbit with Earth, a bonus science opportunity to locate possible fragments of the primordial building blocks that formed our home planet. The long-range observations begin Feb. 9 and run through Feb. 20, using one of the probe's cameras to look for asteroids embedded in swarms scientists believe lurk ahead of and behind Earth in its orbit around the Sun. Named Earth-Trojans, the objects likely group in clouds at Sun-Earth Lagrange points, where the combined pull of gravity from the bodies would allow asteroids to orbit in lock-step with Earth. The so-called L4 and L5 Lagrange points lead and follow Earth by 60 degrees in its path around the Sun. The same positions in front of and behind Jupiter harbour thousands of Trojan asteroids, and smaller Trojan swarms have been discovered near Venus, Mars, Uranus and Neptune. It turns out OSIRIS-REx is about to pass through the Sun-Earth L4 Lagrange point, and managers decided to scan the region where Earth-Trojans might be located to see what the spacecraft can find. Now located nearly 74 million miles from Earth, OSIRIS-REx is on a seven year-journey to asteroid Bennu and back, charged with gathering rock samples from the mountain-sized object and delivering them to scientists for examination inside laboratories on the ground. Since its launch Sept. 8, 2016, OSIRIS-REx has switched on all of its science instruments and performed a major course correction maneuver to aim for a flyby of Earth this Sept. 22. Earth's gravity will slingshot the spacecraft toward Bennu. The Dec. 28 burn changed OSIRIS-REx's speed by 964 mph and consumed a quarter of the probe's propellant supply. The maneuver was the largest of the mission until the Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft's arrival burn at Bennu in August 2018. Another small \"clean-up\" thruster firing Jan. 18 further tweaked OSIRIS-REx's trajectory, and the spacecraft switched over to its high-power antenna Jan. 25 to beam data back to Earth at faster rates. The milestones clear the way for the mission's first science campaign next week. \"The Earth-Trojan asteroid search provides a substantial advantage to the OSIRIS-REx mission,\" said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator from the University of Arizona in Tucson. \"Not only do we have the opportunity to discover new members of an asteroid class, but more importantly, we are practicing critical mission operations in advance of our arrival at Bennu, which ultimately reduces mission risk.\" Only one of the elusive Earth-Trojans has been detected to date. Astronomers using NASA's WISE infrared telescope confirmed the discovery of an asteroid in 2011 that fit the definition of an Earth-Trojan. Asteroid 2010 TK7 is about 1,000 feet in diameter, and experts predict its extreme orbit, which takes it far above and below the plane of the planets, will be stable for at least the next several thousand years. Scientists consider 2010 TK7 an outlier of a large group of asteroids sharing Earth's orbit, some of which may have been there since the solar system formed more than 4.5 billion years ago. \"The orbital motion of 2010 TK7 is chaotic and unstable on billion-year timescales, and it is unlikely to be a remnant from the formation of the Earth,\" Lauretta wrote in a blog post describing the upcoming observing campaign. \"The existence and size of a primordial population of Earth-Trojans are not well constrained and represents a significant gap in our inventory of small bodies in near-Earth space.\" Earth-Trojans are difficult to find from the ground because they are usually in daylight, and the WISE spacecraft orbiting Earth detected 2010 TK7 because its unique orbit oscillates farther from the sun's position in the sky than most members of the group. Current ground-based surveys are only sensitive to Earth-Trojan asteroids bigger than about 3,000 feet, or approximately 1 kilometre, said Carl Hergenrother, an OSIRIS-REx staff scientist at the University of Arizona. By mid-February, OSIRIS-REx will be \"an ideal spot to undertake a survey,\" Lauretta wrote. Between Feb. 9 and Feb. 20, the spacecraft's mapping camera will take 145 pictures per day of the volume of space where Earth-Trojans are expected to reside, according to Lauretta. \"It's a big cloud, and there should be material there,\" Hergenrother said at a Jan. 12 meeting of NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group. \"We should be able to detect stuff down to 100 metres, and possibly even smaller, depending on the performance of our cameras, and the albedo. \"If we don't find anything, it either means there's a lot less objects out there than we were thinking, or they're a lot smaller,\" Hergenrother said. While Lauretta said there is a scientific motivation for the Earth-Trojan search, the top reason for the campaign is to practice techniques the OSIRIS- REx science team plans to employ once the spacecraft arrives at Bennu. On approach to Bennu, the probe's cameras will look near the asteroid to hunt for tiny miniature moons as small as 4 inches. Navigators want to know the location of any debris around Bennu to prevent a crash with the spacecraft. Jupiter and several large distant asteroids will be imaged by OSIRIS-REx's camera when it scans for Earth-Trojans. The images will help the ground team rehearse the complex real-time in-space navigation the mission requires during the rendezvous with Bennu, along with the identification of moving targets mimicking the behaviour of potential mini-moons surrounding the asteroid. Although the scientific objectives are secondary, Lauretta said his team is excited about the prospect of making a discovery so early in the mission. \"We'll clearly be able to set an upper limit on what's out there because we know what we could detect if it was there,\" Lauretta said at the Jan. 12 science meeting. OSIRIS-REx could also discover an asteroid from another family that just happens to pass through the camera's field-of-view, Lauretta said. But scientists will pin down the orbit of any object OSIRIS-REx detects, and an Earth-Trojan asteroid locked in a stable orbit could be evidence of a larger cloud of mini-worlds hidden from view. \"Is this dynamically stable? Could it be a primordial Earth object?\" Lauretta asked, posing questions scientists will have if OSIRIS-REx finds anything starting next week. \"That would be the most fascinating thing that we could discover.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2017/02/01/nasas-osiris-rex-probe-moonlights-as-asteroid-sleuth/"}, {"title": "Surveying the Scenery 90 Million Miles From Earth", "date": "2017-02-09", "content": "A NASA spacecraft has begun its search for an enigmatic class of near-Earth objects known as Earth-Trojan asteroids. OSIRIS- REx, currently on a two-year outbound journey to the asteroid Bennu, will spend almost two weeks searching for evidence of these small bodies. Trojan asteroids are trapped in stable gravity wells, called Lagrange points, which precede or follow a planet. OSIRIS-REx is currently traveling through Earth's fourth Lagrange point, which is located 60 degrees ahead in Earth's orbit around the sun, about 90 million miles from our planet. The mission team will use this opportunity to take multiple images of the area with the spacecraft's MapCam camera in the hope of identifying Earth- Trojan asteroids in the region. MapCam is one of three cameras built at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory that will guide the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft to Bennu and document the sampling mission. The search for Earth-Trojans will mark the first time a spacecraft conducts a search for these elusive objects from the L4 point. The idea for the search originated years ago, shortly after NASA had selected the mission for funding, with Renu Malhotra, a Regents' Professor of Planetary Science at LPL. During a presentation given by Dante Lauretta, now the principal investigator of OSIRIS-REx, Malhotra noticed the spacecraft's trajectory would take it right by Earth's fourth Lagrange point. \"I said to Dante, 'Hey, while you're in that neighborhood of the solar system, you should check out the scenery!'\" she says. \"I'm thrilled that he and his team were very persistent in making the case to NASA, obtaining approval and making a plan on how to go about the survey.\" The search commenced on Feb. 9 and continues through Feb. 20. On each observation day, the spacecraft's MapCam will take 135 survey images that will be processed and examined by the mission's imaging scientists at the UA's Michael J. Drake Building, the mission's headquarters. Although scientists have discovered thousands of Trojan asteroids accompanying other planets, only one Earth-Trojan has been identified to date, asteroid 2010 TK7. Scientists predict that there should be more Trojans sharing Earth's orbit, but detecting them is extremely difficult, as observers have to point their telescopes to a portion of the sky close to the rising or setting sun. Plus, asteroids are intrinsically faint because they are so small. \"Because the Earth's fourth Lagrange point is relatively stable, it is possible that remnants of the material that built Earth are trapped within it,\" Lauretta says. \"So this search gives us a unique opportunity to explore the primordial building blocks of Earth.\" Malhotra echoes Lauretta's excitement: \"The search would give us a whole new window on a population of asteroids that we know very little about because we can't see them very well from Earth. We don't know what they might look like - if they are truly primordial material that we don't have in our meteorite collections yet, or whether we might have samples in our collections and simply haven't recognized them as such. If they're out there, it's quite likely they have sent some meteorites to Earth, but we wouldn't know, because we have not been able to connect the dots. \"This is truly an exploration, and there is of course the possibility that we come up empty-handed.\" But if it doesn't go that way, scientists will be able to tell us much more about our planet's place in space with regard to what else is out there. \"If there is a sizable population of Trojan bodies where we suspect them to be, it means some might leak out from time to time and possibly hit the Earth or the Moon,\" Malhotra says. \"If we found substantial numbers of these asteroids, it would tell us that Earth's orbit has changed very little over time. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult to retain ancient asteroids in those locations.\" Confirming populations of Trojans also might help planetary scientists solve the long-standing \"mystery of the missing craters\" on the moon, a fascinating side story all by itself. As the moon travels through space along its orbit around Earth, it gets struck by space rocks crossing its path. Naturally, the hemisphere that is facing forward is being pelted more frequently than the moon's trailing hemisphere, Malhotra explains. \"Just like when you run through the rain, you get more drops on your forehead than on the back side of your head,\" she says. But when the researchers calculated what should be the difference in cratering rate on the moon's leading versus its trailing side, they found a discrepancy, showing that the moon gets hit more frequently than it should, based on known asteroid populations. \"One possible explanation is there might be hidden populations of asteroids,\" Malhotra says, \"and the Earth's Trojans could be one of them.\" Regardless of whether the OSIRIS-REx team discovers any new asteroids, the search provides a valuable opportunity for a \"rehearsal\" exercise. The operations involved in searching for Earth-Trojan asteroids closely resemble those required to search for natural satellites and other potential hazards around Bennu when the spacecraft approaches its target in 2018. Being able to practice these mission-critical operations in advance will help the OSIRIS-REx team reduce mission risk once the spacecraft arrives at Bennu. The study plan also includes opportunities for MapCam to image Jupiter, several galaxies, and the main belt asteroids 55 Pandora, 47 Aglaja and 12 Victoria.

Scientists hope to ultimately land the probe on Bennu with the aim to collect two ounces of the asteroid, which may offer clues to the origins of the solar system. The mission will also beam back calculations of Bennu's orbit, given the asteroid has a relatively high probability of impacting Earth in the late 22nd century. The probe aims to return its rock collection to Earth by 2023. For now, you can scope out this shot for our planet taken by the space miner. The dark streaks at the top are due to the short exposure times - less than three milliseconds - that are needed to take a photo of an object as bright as the Earth.

Taken together these gases in our atmosphere set Earth apart from other planets. While hardly a discovery, the findings helped scientists calibrate the ASU- built instrument and show that it is working perfectly after a year in space. When NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft flew past Earth on Sept. 22, the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite looked back at our planet about two hours after closest approach. The Pacific Ocean and clouds filled most of the view; Australia is visible at lower left. At the same time, the ASU-built OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer took a series of spectral measurements so scientists could calibrate the instrument. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft was launched Sept. 8, 2016, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It is now about halfway on the journey to its target, a primitive carbonaceous asteroid named Bennu. The gravity assist the spacecraft received in the Earth flyby changed its trajectory so that it is now on track to arrive at Bennu in August 2018. OSIRIS-REx stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security - Regolith Explorer. The mission's goals are to return a sample of surface rocks, soil and dust from Bennu, map the asteroid's global properties, document the surface at the sample site down to centimeter scales, characterize its type of asteroid for comparison with meteorites, and measure a subtle effect of sunlight that can alter an asteroid's orbit. The latter two goals are the main scientific tasks for the ASU-built OSIRIS- REX Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or OTES for short. Philip Christensen, Regents' Professor of geological sciences in Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration, designed the instrument, which was constructed on ASU's Tempe campus. \"OTES is the first complex space instrument to be designed and built entirely at ASU,\" Christensen said. \"We're very proud that this instrument is on its way and operating as designed.\" With an orbit that comes inside Earth's orbit, Bennu is the most accessible asteroid rich in organic materials from the early solar system. It reflects only 3 percent of the sunlight falling on it, making it about as dark as charcoal. When OSIRIS-REx arrives at Bennu, OTES will make a global mineral map of the asteroid, which is roughly spherical and about 1,600 feet across. The map will help mission scientists decide the best place to collect surface samples for eventual return to Earth. Given its Earth-crossing orbit, Bennu is also a space rock scientists want to keep an eye on. They estimate that it has a 1-in-2,700 chance of hitting Earth in the year 2170. Which directly leads to OTES' other major task: measuring the temperature and heat emission over Bennu's surface as it spins through its 4.3-hour-long day. This is to help scientists gauge the strength of the Yarkovsky effect on Bennu. The Yarkovsky effect is a weak but steady thrust produced by sunlight as it falls on a spinning object. The effect comes from the fact that sunlit ground is warmer in the afternoon than the same ground is in the morning, because sunlight has had longer to heat it. This means that the afternoon side of a rotating object radiates more heat than the morning side, thus producing an extremely small thrust. The effect is negligible for massive objects like planets, but for small bodies like Bennu the effect could shift its orbit. Using OTES data, OSIRIS-REx will help scientists assess how fast Bennu's orbit is changing and gather information useful for future generations, which may have to take action to deflect the asteroid. OSIRIS-REx will remain at Bennu until 2021. Then with the sample of rocks and dust safely packed into a sealed re-entry capsule, the spacecraft will fire its engine and go into an orbit to meet with Earth in 2023. After releasing the sample return capsule, OSIRIS-REx will fly past Earth and continue in its solar orbit. The capsule with the samples will enter the atmosphere behind a heat shield and land under a parachute in Utah. Flyby yields first OTES results. Christensen said, \"This Earth flyby gave us our first real data. Up to now we have just looked at an onboard test target. It's exciting to collect spectral data on a real solar-system body. OTES has performed exactly as we hoped.\" The spectrometer works by examining infrared wavelengths. \"The infrared is great for identifying minerals,\" Christensen explained. \"Rocks and minerals may look similar to the eye, but they show unique spectra when studied in the infrared, where their 'colors' stand out differently.\" Showing almost entirely ocean and clouds, planet Earth appears misnamed in this view taken by OSIRIS-REx on Sept. 22, two hours after its closest approach to Earth. The circles, each about 500 miles in diameter, indicate where the OTES spectrometer made its observations. The peaks and valleys in the spectral curves show absorption of solar energy by methane, ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapor in Earth's atmosphere. OTES also took the temperature of the ocean surface and the stratosphere. As it happened, the flyby trajectory gave OTES a view of Earth dominated by the Pacific Ocean. Almost no land areas came within the instrument's field of view, which saw clouds and seawater. Even so, the instrument worked as designed. In addition to identifying minerals, the infrared also excels at detecting gases such as methane, ozone, carbon dioxide and water vapor, which are common in our atmosphere. \"We measured them with OTES and got good 'ground truth' results,\" Christensen explained. \"Earth isn't our prime target, however,\" Christensen said. \"That will come about a year from now. But the Earth flyby was a great test for OTES and the other instruments on the spacecraft.

The probe was 804,000 miles from Earth and 735,000 miles from the moon when it captured the black-and-white image, NASA officials wrote in a description Thursday. Also on Thursday, the agency released a shot of Earth that OSIRIS-REx took Sept. 22 - the day of the flyby - from a distance of 69,000 miles. \"The image has been rotated so that Earth's north pole is located at the top, and the Baja Peninsula is visible above and to the right of center,\" NASA officials wrote in an image description. \"Cloud cover and the Pacific Ocean dominate most of the image, but Hurricane Maria and the remnants of Hurricane Jose can be seen in the far upper-right portion of the image, off the east coast of the United States.\" OSIRIS-Rex took both of the newly released photos with its navigation camera. On Tuesday, NASA released a color image of Earth that the spacecraft captured on flyby day using its MapCam camera. During the flyby, OSIRIS-Rex zoomed a mere 10,711 miles above Antarctica.

The MapCam camera on the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft took the composite color image Oct. 2 at a distance of around 3.2 million miles from Earth, or approximately 13 times the distance between the Earth and the moon. The moon appeared just inside MapCam's field of view, allowing both planetary bodies to appear in the same frame, according to information released by scientists at the University of Arizona, which operates the camera. MapCam is one of three science cameras aboard OSIRIS-REx, which launched in September 2016 on a two-year journey to asteroid Bennu, an object measuring around 1,600 feet in diameter that regularly comes near Earth. The robotic mission will arrive at Bennu late next year, survey the unexplored asteroid, and then descend to its surface for a touch-and-go maneuver to capture at least 2.1 ounces - 60 grammes - of rock samples for return to Earth in September 2023. OSIRIS-REx is short for the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security - Regolith Explorer. The probe's Sept. 22 flyby of Earth used the planet's gravity to slingshot toward Bennu, naturally bending its trajectory without expending precious fuel. The MapCam camera got a much closer view of Earth just after the Sept. 22 flyby, returning a view of the Pacific Ocean from a distance of 106,000 miles. Australia is visible in the lower left of the image, and Baja California in the upper right. Scientists also used the Earth encounter to calibrate OSIRIS-REx's other instruments, which will make measurements of mineral and chemical make-up of Bennu, including a search for organic molecules, the building blocks of life. The results will help guide where the spacecraft picks up the sample for return to Earth. The mission's Canadian-built laser altimeter and a student-built dust experiment were not activated during the Earth fly. They will not be fully switched on until arrival at Bennu. Next up for the mission will be a series of course correction burns over the next year to set up for the final approach to Bennu. Science observations of Bennu will begin in August 2018, and detailed images of Bennu should be acquired by OSIRIS-REx in October. Analysts will look for evidence of debris or moons in the asteroid's vicinity before OSIRIS-REx's arrival.

NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Hayabusa 2 mission are in the final months of their journeys to asteroids Bennu and Ryugu, two rocky worlds that to date have only been studied through the lenses of telescopes. The Hayabusa 2 and OSIRIS-REx missions were developed, built and launched separately aboard Japanese H-2A and United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets in December 2014 and September 2016, but they share many of the same objectives, and scientists intend to collaborate on their results. The samples will tell scientists more about how the solar system formed, how planets grew and evolved, and perhaps how life took hold on Earth. The Japanese probe is on track to arrive at its destination, asteroid Ryugu, by early July to kick off a year-and-a-half of up-close exploration and mapping, culminating in three touch-and-go manoeuvres to pick up rock and dust from the asteroid, including one sample excavated from beneath Ryugu's surface. Hayabusa 2 also carries four robotic landers - three built in Japan and the French-German Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout, or MASCOT - that will hop across Ryugu to multiple locations, returning imagery and other scientific measurements. The biggest of the landing drones, the European-supplied shoebox-sized MASCOT robot, is set to make its descent in September or October after deployment from the Hayabusa 2 mothership. Since its launch from Japan's Tanegashima Space Center in 2014, Hayabusa 2 has fired its ion engines for two multi-month campaigns to target Ryugu. The low- power thrusters burn xenon gas to produce minuscule levels of thrust, but they can operate for months at a time, reshaping Hayabusa 2's trajectory. Hayabusa 2 zipped by Earth in December 2015, using the planet's gravity for an extra kick toward Ryugu's orbit. The asteroid takes an elongated path around the solar system, and it typically is located farther from the Sun than the Earth. Ryugu briefly dips inside Earth's orbit on each 1.3-year lap around the Sun, making it a potentially hazardous asteroid in our celestial neighborhood. The Japanese asteroid probe ignited its ion propulsion system again Jan. 10 for the final major maneuver before arriving at Ryugu, according to Yuichi Tsuda, JAXA's project manager for Hayabusa 2. The spacecraft will continue thrusting until June 5, when it is positioned around 4,000 miles from Ryugu, then the probe's conventional hydrazine-fueled rocket jets will fine-tune its approach. \"We are just six months before our arrival, and we have just started the final ion engine burn a week ago, and that is the most critical one,\" Tsuda said Wednesday in a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group, a community of scientists who specialize in asteroid and comet research. Hayabusa 2's camera should begin tracking Ryugu in May to help controllers navigate the craft toward its target, according to Tsuda. The roughly $300 million Hayabusa 2 mission is a follow-up to JAXA's Hayabusa spacecraft, which launched in 2003 and arrived at asteroid Itokawa in 2005. Despite technical difficulties, which prevented Hayabusa from collecting the mission's planned specimens, the hard-luck spacecraft returned a canister to Earth in 2010 with microscopic samples plucked from Itokawa's surface. Asteroid Ryugu has never been visited by a spacecraft before, but long- distance telescopic images indicate the object has a diameter of approximately 2,950 feet, with a gravitational field 60,000 times weaker than Earth's. Because of the tenuous gravity, Hayabusa 2's approach and landings on Ryugu will be more akin to a rendezvous with another spacecraft than landing on another planet. Ground-based observations suggest Ryugu is near-spherical in shape, and scientists classify it as a C-type asteroid, a type of object that is primarily made up of carbon and appear almost as black as coal. Hayabusa 2 will initially park itself 20 kilometres, or about 12 miles, from the asteroid for a comprehensive survey with a set of spectrometers, cameras, and other sensors to map the tiny world. Tsuda said the probe is scheduled to arrive at the 12-mile hold point from Ryugu between June 21 and July 5, depending on tracking and navigation during the final approach. \"We do not know much about Ryugu, so the asteroid operations schedule is strongly dependent on the rotation state, thermal distribution and chemical distribution, and shape properties of the asteroid,\" Tsuda said. \"We'll start by lowering the altitude to 5 kilometres for higher- resolution, and then between September and October, we will try to deploy two rovers, MINERVA 2 and MASCOT.\" The battery-powered MASCOT lander was developed by the same French-German team that led the Philae mission to touch down on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko after release from Europe's Rosetta spacecraft in November 2014. MASCOT's flight plan calls for it to return data for about 18 hours after deployment from Hayabusa 2. Three touch-and-go maneuvers are planned by Hayabusa 2 in October, February 2019 and April or May of 2019. The last descent will try to scoop up underground material from Ryugu. \"Because this is the final year before arrival, we have done extensive practice to be ready for the arrival and proximity operations,\" Tsuda said. Hayabusa 2's team conducted operations training and a landing site selection simulation to rehearse how scientists and engineers will coordinate with each other during mission's action-packed stay at Ryugu. Japanese scientists say Hayabusa 2 will collect at least one gramme of material from Ryugu. Another rover will be deployed from Hayabusa 2 for a landing attempt in mid-2019. In December 2019, Hayabusa 2 will boost itself away from the asteroid. Its sample return canister will be ejected for a high-speed re-entry through Earth's atmosphere and a landing in the Australian outback in December 2020. Meanwhile, NASA's $1 billion OSIRIS-REx mission is on the final leg of its two-year journey to asteroid Bennu, a miniature world about 1,600 feet across. Bennu is a rare kind of object - scientists know it as a \"B-type\" asteroid - and is likely loaded with lots of carbon, the backbone of organic molecules. In August, the solar-powered voyager will begin its final approach to the asteroid, and eventually slip into orbit. After a thorough survey of Bennu with OSIRIS-REx's spectrometers, cameras and laser altimeter, scientists will decide where to snag a sample. Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx's principal investigator, said Wednesday that the mission is ready for prime time at Bennu. \"OSIRIS-REx has been in flight for about 16 months now,\" he said at the semi- annual SBAG meeting held at NASA's Ames Research Center in California. \"We've had a very productive outbound cruise so far.\" The spacecraft got a gravitational boost from Earth in September, following a flyby trajectory similar to the one used by Hayabusa 2 in 2015. Like asteroid Ryugu, Bennu spends most of its time outside of Earth's orbit. But it crosses Earth's orbital path twice on each 1.2-year circuit of the sun, making it a low-risk impact hazard. Lauretta said OSIRIS-REx is healthy on the final months of its trip to Bennu, with engineers only monitoring a minor concern with outgassing coming from the craft's sample return canister heat shield and backshell. Ground controllers detected a small amount of unexpected thrust coming from the sample carrier last year, and engineers determined the force was caused by outgassing of water absorbed by the sample return capsule during launch preparations in Florida. Water retention is common on spacecraft being prepared for launch, officials said. \"While this small thrust would not be a problem for other missions, the gravity at the target asteroid Bennu is low enough that even this small amount of thrust could make orbital operations more difficult for OSIRIS-REx,\" mission officials wrote in a status update. Controllers have steered the spacecraft to point the sample return capsule toward the sun multiple times since October, using solar heating to bake out the water. Lauretta said the outgassing has diminished as predicted. \"We fully expect that we'll be able to dry out these components, and this should not be an issue when we get to the asteroid,\" Lauretta said. \"But this is something that we're paying attention to very closely, and continuing to try to mitigate this unexpected event.\" Built by Lockheed Martin, OSIRIS-REx is short for the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security - Regolith Explorer. Its objective is to snag at least 2.1 ounces - 60 grammes - of surface material, and return the specimens to Earth in September 2023. OSIRIS-REx's approach phase officially begins Aug. 17, Lauretta said, at a range of about 1.2 million miles from Bennu. Detailed images of Bennu should be acquired by OSIRIS-REx in October. Analysts will look for evidence of debris or moons in the asteroid's vicinity before OSIRIS-REx's arrival. All but one of OSIRIS-REx's instruments were tested when the spacecraft flew by Earth in September, verifying the sensors were ready for Bennu. A laser altimeter instrument provided by the Canadian Space Agency will be activated after the probe gets to the asteroid. \"We are now about seven months away from optical acquisition of Bennu,\" Lauretta said. \"We expect that to occur on Aug. 17, 2018, kicking off about a three-month-long approach phase, and then getting us into the preliminary survey in late November and early December of 2018. That will be the first real resolved imaging of the asteroid.\" The asteroid has a surface area of about 200 acres - 0.78 square kilometres - and some of OSIRIS-REx's instruments will capture data with centimetre-scale resolution, or better. The observations will add context to the sample OSIRIS- REx will return to Earth, and identify resources that might be valuable for astronauts in the future. During the next phase of the mission, in late 2019, mission scientists will narrow down targets for OSIRIS-REx to go down and snatch up a piece of Bennu. A final decision by top NASA management will pick the sampling site based on several factors, primarily to avoid damaging the spacecraft and to maximise the likelihood of capturing primitive, pre-biotic material, the mission's scientific payoff. The all-important sampling attempt is scheduled for July 2020, when OSIRIS-REx will extend a robot arm to touch Bennu. OSIRIS-REx will depart Bennu some time between March 2021 and April 2022 - managers have some flexibility - and drop the capsule containing the precious asteroid samples for a blazing-hot re-entry over the Western United States on Sept. 24, 2023. Specialists at a military training ground in Utah will stand by to retrieve the samples. But first OSIRIS-REx, like Hayabusa 2, has to home on its destination. \"It's going to be a very exciting year for us,\" Lauretta said. \"The team is very excited and very ready for Bennu, and to begin the science campaign for this mission.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2018/01/18/asteroid-missions-on-track-to-reach-their-destinations-in-2018/"}, {"title": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx Captures New Earth-Moon Image", "date": "2018-02-14", "content": "As part of an engineering test, NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft captured this image of the Earth and Moon using its NavCam1 imager on January 17 from a distance of 39.5 million miles (63.6 million km).

If all goes well, the sample will be returned to Earth in 2025 for detailed laboratory analysis. Lauretta said the spacecraft should begin resolving features on Bennu's surface in October. Starting 3 December, OSIRIS-REx will begin flying in formation with the asteroid before slipping into orbit at the end of the month. That milestone is just one of three major encounters coming up for NASA spacecraft this fall. The agency's InSight Mars lander is is on course for touchdown on the red planet 26 November to explore the deep interior of the red planet. And within hours of OSIRIS-REx reaching orbit around Bennu on 31 December, NASA's New Horizons probe will streak past a small Kuiper Belt object nicknamed Ultima Thule on New Year's Day, giving scientists a close-up look at a chunk of debris left over from the birth of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. New Horizons completed its primary mission objective in 2014 when it flew past Pluto. \"It'll be the season of science, we will be enjoying every minute of it, and it'll be a great time for all of us,\" said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. \"I hope everyone's ready to stay up all night on the 31st and enjoy the whole package.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2018/08/25/osiris-rex-captures-its-first-images-of-asteroid-bennu/"}, {"title": "OSIRIS-REx Snaps its First Pic of Asteroid Bennu", "date": "2018-08-28", "content": "If you think your commute is bad, try traveling over a billion miles to get to work. After almost two years of space travel, NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer spacecraft finally has a clear view of its jobsite - a near-Earth, carbon-rich asteroid named Bennu. The craft's PolyCam camera captured its first image of Bennu on August 17 from a distance just 1.4 million miles, and will now begin its final approach. Once it arrives, NASA's first asteroid-bound mission will start mapping and studying its 1,640 foot long surface, and ultimately bring samples back to Earth. These samples will not only give us a first-hand look at an asteroid in its original state, but will allow us to glimpse into our celestial past. Previous studies have shown that Bennu is rich in carbon, which is thought to be a prominent element in the solar system's oldest asteroids. It's believed that these ancient objects haven't changed much since the formation of the solar system, and that they still contain organic molecules, amino acids and volatiles - a.k.a. the building blocks of life. By bringing these primitive samples back to Earth, we can get a better idea of how our solar system formed and how life spread throughout it. Unfortunately, we also selected Bennu for more ominous reasons. It's on NASA's list of potentially hazardous asteroids, coming within just 186,000 miles of Earth every six years. Researchers think that Bennu could possibly impact Earth in the late 22^nd century, and even though it's not nearly large enough wipe out humans or destroy the planet, we should still know what we'd be up against. OSIRIS-REx began its 1.1 billion mile journey in September 2016 when an Atlas V rocket launched it into orbit around the sun. Roughly one year and one trip around the sun later, the craft pulled a \"gravity assist\" maneuver, where it approached Earth from behind and got pulled into its strong gravitational field. Borrowing some of Earth's orbital energy as it flew by, OSIRIS-REx was able to speed up and launch itself toward Bennu's orbital plane, sort of like a slingshot. This move, which has been used on many other missions, reduces the mission's overall travel time and cuts down on the amount of heavy fuel it needs to lug around. Since entering Bennu's orbital plane, the mission has been cruising at about 32,000 miles per hour, relative to Earth. And it's now gaining on Bennu at a rate of 1,200 miles per hour, relative to the asteroid. #### Probing a primitive asteroid As it inches closer, the craft will slow down to Bennu's speed and start using its onboard instruments to search for orbiting satellites - mini-moons - identify unique surface features and study its light spectrum to determine its composition. When it arrives in December, it will spend four months hovering only a few miles above the asteroid to measure its size, mass and get an up close and personal view of its exterior. It will spend a year and a half or so collecting data before finally homing in on a sample site in July 2020. Once selected, OSIRIS-REx's Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism will contact the surface for just five seconds and blast it with nitrogen gas, causing the surface to explode into pieces small enough to bring home in its Sample Return Capsule. The mission hopes to collect a minimum of 2.1 ounces of rock, with room for up to 4.4 pounds in the capsule. If all goes as planned, the samples will safely parachute on to the Utah desert in September 2023. Asteroid missions like OSIRIS-REx and Japan's Hayabusa2 will not only reveal the elements that made up our early solar system, but will also demonstrate what our advanced space technology is capable of. I mean, if we can make a round-trip journey to an asteroid in a matter of years, who knows what we'll be able to do next?

It is hoped that studying the asteroid can offer a glimpse of when our own planet was developing. Currently, all we have to work with are the remote observations of asteroids using telescopes, and the meteors that have made it to Earth. Scientists are trying to match asteroids to the meteors they originated from. By landing on Bennu, taking a physical sample and then returning it to Earth, researchers will have the best picture yet as to where the meteors and their parent asteroids originated. Currently, OSIRIS-REx is still 2.2 million kilometres from Bennu. Travelling at up to 30,000 kilometres per hour, it is expected that the spacecraft will catch up with the asteroid in under 100 days' time. Once there, it will begin a series of manoeuvres in order to study the celestial body in as much detail as possible. Within the first month, OSIRIS-REx will perform flybys of Bennu's north pole, equator and south pole, dipping from between 19 to seven kilometres from the surface. This will give researchers a much better picture of the asteroid's surface, as well as allow them to make the first direct measurements of the Bennu's mass. The spacecraft will continue surveying and mapping the surface extensively. This will give the mission team the time needed to identify two potential landing sites. Rich Burns, the project manager for OSIRIS-REx, shares some of the main obstacles of this project. 'Bennu's low gravity provides a unique challenge for the mission,' says Burns. 'At roughly 500 metres in diameter, Bennu will be the smallest object that any spacecraft has ever orbited.' Once a suitable site has been selected, the spacecraft will touch Bennu to collect a sample of its surface material, known as regolith. This is expected to occur in early July 2020, before OSIRIS-REx turns around and head back to Earth along with it its cargo, landing back around September 2023.

Yesterday on 13 November 2018, NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft executed its fourth Asteroid Approach Maneuver. The probe terminated its Attitude Control System thrusters to moderate the shuttle from around 0.31 mph to 0.10 mph. The ACS thrusters are equipped for speed changes as little as 0.02 mph. The mission group will keep on looking at telemetry and the following information throughout the following week to check the new direction. The move focused on the probe to fly through a passageway intended for the gathering of high-goals pictures that will be utilized to construct a shape model of Bennu. With the execution of AAM-4, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft concludes a six-week series of Bennu approach maneuvers.

As part of its preparations for this highly anticipated encounter, mission control has successfully carried out an important dress rehearsal starring the robotic arm that will be used to grab samples of dust and rock from the surface. With Bennu zipping around the Sun at an average speed of 101,000 km/h, OSIRIS-REx is currently completing a series of careful braking maneuvers as it makes its way toward the asteroid. Scheduled to enter its orbit on December 3, OSIRIS-REx will spend almost a year surveying the asteroid and picking out the best location pull its sample from. The instrument it will use to grab that sample is called the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism. Designed and built by Lockheed Martin over more than a decade, the 11-ft arm features three articulating joints, a rounded sampling head and three bottles of high-pressure nitrogen gas. In October, OSIRIS-REx jettisoned the cover off the TAGSAM arm and left it in a resting position for a few weeks. It was then fully deployed into its sampling position with images, seen above, confirming that it extended and retracted just as it was designed to do. This is the first time the TAGSAM arm has been deployed in the micro-gravity environment of space. \"The team is very pleased that TAGSAM has been released, deployed, and is operating as commanded through its full range of motion,\" says Rich Burns, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"It has been restrained for over two years since launch, so it is gratifying to see it out of its shackles and performing well.\" Sometime in the early 2020s, TAGSAM will go in for the kill. It will blast the surface of Bennu with its nitrogen gas to stir up material and use the TAGSAM head to capture around 2.1 oz of regolith. This is expected to take around five seconds, before OSIRIS-REx retreats and starts to make its way back to Earth. \"Now that we have put TAGSAM through its paces in space and know it is ready to perform at Bennu, we can focus on the challenges of navigating around the asteroid and seeking out the best possible sample site,\" says Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona, Tucson.

The next stage in the University of Arizona-led mission includes surveying the surface of Bennu to find a good place to retrieve a soil sample and return it to Earth. Principal investigator Dante Lauretta says earthbound radar telescopes provided an accurate blueprint of what Bennu looked like from hundreds of thousands of miles away. The object came within view of OSIRIS-REx's cameras for the first time a few months ago. An view of the asteroid Bennu created using eight images taken by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft's camera system, Oct. 29, 2018. \"They processed that data to predict the shape of the asteroid and they absolutely nailed it,\" said Lauretta. \"So, we were ecstatic to see that shape come into focus and to realize what we've been planning the mission to all along is correct.\" Lauretta notes excitement is building among members of the UA science team, some of whom have worked on the project for years. \"Some of us, including myself, have been working on this program for a decade and a half, from the early conception stages to proposal writing, design, build, test, launch and cruise of the spacecraft out to the asteroid,\" he said.

This initial survey is in anticipation of Independence Day 2020, when the spacecraft-the size of a UPS truck with the mobility of a hummingbird-will press its sample collection mechanism against Bennu to bring home a sealed canister of premium, grade-A asteroid for analyses at laboratories around the world. \"We will have seen Bennu from a point of light, and once back on Earth, down to its constituent atoms. It's pretty amazing. There's no other body that that's true for,\" says Dante Lauretta, the mission's principal investigator, from his office at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. He thinks for a moment, and adds, \"Maybe Wild 2.\" The comet Wild 2 was sampled by NASA's Stardust mission in 2004. It was the agency's first sample-return mission since the Apollo program, though it didn't approach the audacity of what Lauretta and his team are doing at Bennu. Stardust collected particles in the comet's wake, the largest of which was about a millimeter, and found amino acids essential for life, changing the scientific understanding of cometary formation. OSIRIS-REx, on the other hand, will take home up to 4.4 pounds of the carbonaceous asteroid. It is impossible to predict what its quarry will reveal, as constituents of Bennu are believed to be older than the solar system itself, but studying such ancient material is likely to fill in gaps in our models of solar system formation and the path that ultimately led to life on Earth. Sample-return missions are exactly what they sound like, grabbing some celestial specimen in its natural habitat and bringing it home for analysis. Though planetary scientists have worked wizardry with landers and rovers, their mechanical proxies are still frustratingly limited in the science they can do. Robots' scientific payloads are limited by mass and power, while spectrometers on Earth can be the size of a building. A synchrotron might be a kilometer across. Those are Star Trek sizes. The idea behind sample return is that if we can't bring the tools to the target, we'll bring the target to the tools. \"I was in this building in 2008 when the Phoenix lander was on the Martian surface, and those first scoops of Mars wouldn't shake free from the robotic arm for analysis,\" Lauretta says. \"They finally figured it out. They warmed it up, and it released and made its way to the mass spectrometer, and we were scratching our heads and trying to make sense of it. And I thought to myself: If I had one grain that I could swab from that scoop, I could tell you a hundred times more information than what you just got off that instrument.\" Not all areas of planetary study are advanced by sample analysis. A geophysicist hoping to understand a planetary object might not reach for a shovel of alien regolith at first. NASA has an established exploration cadence for understanding planetary bodies: flyby, orbiter, lander, rover, sample- return mission and then a human mission. The moon checked each box. Mars 2020, NASA's next rover set to launch in its namesake year, will begin the sample caching process. It will bottle Mars dirt for a future lander to gather up and blast back home. After that, you send astronauts. \"For decades, samples were glaringly missing from the study of Mars,\" says Lindy Elkins-Tanton, the director of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University. \"As advanced as we are with remote instrumentation, it is amazing how much more we learn when we've got it in our hands. There is just no substitution.\" Though planetary scientists study Martian meteorites for insight into the history of that planet, the meteorites cannot answer the question of whether Mars was ever an abode of life. Moreover, scientists do not know precicely where or when the samples originated before crashing down to Earth. Though meteorites from Mars discovered on Earth can be dated accurately, they are considered to be a likely biased sample, young relative to the Martian surface. Elkins-Tanton is part of the Mars 2020 science team and serves as the principal investigator of NASA's Psyche mission to study a metal asteroid, thought to be a planetary core, set for launch in 2022. She says that right away, scientists would study Martian samples for organic materials and their isotopic makeups. Such study of isotope ratios would give a strong indication of whether the material was created by life. Researchers would also date the sample, \"something we can't do with any accuracy with robots,\" Elkins-Tanton says. \"It takes super, super fine work in isotope laboratories to get the exact age of a mineral grain or upper rock.\" Scientists presently lack absolute dates for rocks on the surface of Mars, and \"samples would help to solve some of these long-standing arguments about when Mars was wet. What were the different eons, the eras of different chemical activity on the surface on Mars?\" Spacecraft of every flavor are inherently limited by the scientific hardware they fly. By the time Galileo arrived at Jupiter in 1995, its instrumentation was ten years old. Though technology leapt forward during that decade, poor old Galileo could leverage none of it. Sample missions, on the other hand, are essentially future-proof, says Ryan Zeigler, NASA's Apollo sample curator. As technology advances, samples can be pulled from storage and revisited for new analysis. \"I grew up in lunar science with a bone-dry moon,\" he says. \"On Earth, almost every rock has a mineral inside with water tied up inside of it. But when scientists looked at the Apollo samples, they didn't see that.\" This lack of water was factored into models of how the moon formed, how it evolved, and in turn, suggested what the Earth was once made of. \"And then ten years ago, we had better instruments and looked again at the glasses and minerals in the lunar samples and found water in both.\" The lunar models had to be reworked. \"If there are volatiles in the moon, is the giant impact hypothesis viable? Yes, but scientists had to tweak the way the giant impact worked to keep volatiles around. That was significant.\" Such analyses will pay dividends when astronauts return there. \"It costs a lot of money to send anything to the moon, so any resource utilization we can do on site is key. And we can use the composition of the moon from Apollo samples to understand what we can use.\" Zeigler explains that metals in the lunar regolith might be used to make habitats. Water might also be extracted. \"Scientists have come up with a half dozen different ways of making oxygen from lunar soil, using the Apollo samples, on a small scale, to practice on. If I can produce large amounts of water on the moon, or hydrogen and oxygen-that's rocket fuel! Which in turn enables human exploration of other parts of the solar system.\" All samples of celestial objects are handled and stored by the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Division of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. Each time a new sample is collected, new facilities are built to suit its source and keep the sample isolated and unsullied. Though OSIRIS-REx won't return its Bennu samples until 2023, Johnson will soon start construction on new set of labs to house Bennu and also part of the asteroid Ryugu, which will soon be sampled by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency spacecraft Hayabusa-2. The NASA center has already conducted studies for how to store Mars samples; it's just a matter of getting that mission close enough to the finish line to mobilize cranes and bulldozers for the new storage facilities on Earth. Likewise, the astromaterials division is keeping an eye on the Japanese mission Martian Moons Exploration, which will launch in 2024 and sample the larger of Mars' two moons, Phobos. Closer to home, there is CAESAR, a finalist for NASA's New Frontiers program, which would sample comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2038 if it is approved for funding. \"We are already looking at what it would take to curate samples from a comet,\" Zeigler says. \"Luckily we have a lot of time, because it's challenging. It's cold, there's gas involved, there are volatiles involved. It's not impossible, but it's going to require us to relearn how we do this and come up with protocols for how we handle entirely new types of samples.\" Getting the samples back on Earth, though extraordinarily challenging, is only half the battle. The real science begins once they are safe and sound in storage. \"One reason the Apollo samples are still useful to science,\" Zeigler says, \"is because we have spent time and effort to take good care of them, so that they tell us about the moon, and not Houston.\" David W. Brown is author of One Inch From Earth, the story of the scientists behind NASA's mission to Europa. It will be published next year by Custom House.

In a special webcast that began just before the spacecraft reached Bennu, NASA officials and scientists discussed the mission in depth. OSIRIS-REx launched in September 2016 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. For 27 months, the craft has been traveling through the solar system en route to Bennu, which orbits the Sun between Earth and Mars. Now that OSIRIS-REx is at Bennu, the craft will stay about 12 miles away from the asteroid. Over the next four weeks, the spacecraft will conduct multiple flybys of Bennu, collecting data to help scientists determine the asteroid's mass. On December 31, OSIRIS-REx will enter an orbit around the asteroid, making it the smallest object ever orbited by a spacecraft. This set of 16 images shows the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft's steady approach toward the asteroid Bennu during the last half of October 2018. For the next 18 months, the spacecraft will study the asteroid, exploring its terrain and gathering data that could help show how asteroids like Bennu travel through space and how they could even be used as a resource. The craft will also scan the asteroid to find a safe and scientifically interesting location to land and sample. The craft will then descend to Bennu's surface, where it will use a robotic sampling arm to grab at least 60 grams of loose dirt and rock from the asteroid to take home. This will be the largest sample gathered from a space object since the Apollo moon landings. After departing Bennu in 2021, OSIRIS-REx is slated to return home with the asteroid sample on board in September 2023. Among OSIRIS-REx's instruments are a tools to measure visible and near- infrared light, temperature, mineral and chemical content, X-rays, a three-camera suite to help map the asteroid an an altimeter that will help scan the surface to create 3D models. Bennu was formed so long ago that scientists estimate that some of the minerals inside of it are older than our solar system, having come from the cloud of gas and dust that eventually formed the Sun and its protoplanetary disk. As a rock that formed in the infant solar system and has been preserved by the vacuum of space, Bennu has remained relatively unchanged since its creation. This means that the components that make up the asteroid could represent the state of the materials that formed the planets. By studying Bennu, scientists could paint a more detailed picture of the early solar system and better understand how its planets formed. And because Bennu itself could impact Earth within a few centuries, the mission could also help scientists to better understand the threat that asteroids may pose to humans on Earth. \"OSIRIS-REx is a mission to figure out where we came from, as asteroids are remnants from the formation of our solar system. But while the spacecraft might tell us some things about where we have been and where we are headed, it also can remind us of where we are right now,\" NASA said in a press release.

The spacecraft executed a maneuver that transitioned it from flying toward Bennu to operating around the asteroid. Now, at about 11.8 miles from Bennu's Sun-facing surface, OSIRIS-REx will begin a preliminary survey of the asteroid. The spacecraft will commence flyovers of Bennu's north pole, equatorial region, and south pole, getting as close as nearly 4 miles above Bennu during each flyover. The primary science goals of this survey are to refine estimates of Bennu's mass and spin rate, and to generate a more precise model of its shape. The data will help determine potential sites for later sample collection. OSIRIS-REx's mission will help scientists investigate how planets formed and how life began, as well as improve our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth. Asteroids are remnants of the building blocks that formed the planets and enabled life. Those like Bennu contain natural resources, such as water, organics and metals. Future space exploration and economic development may rely on asteroids for these materials. \"As explorers, we at NASA have never shied away from the most extreme challenges in the solar system in our quest for knowledge,\" said Lori Glaze, acting director for NASA's Planetary Science Division. \"Now we're at it again, working with our partners in the U.S. and Canada to accomplish the Herculean task of bringing back to Earth a piece of the early solar system.\" The mission's navigation team will use the preliminary survey of Bennu to practice the delicate task of navigating around the asteroid. The spacecraft will enter orbit around Bennu on Dec. 31 --thus making Bennu, which is only about 1,600 feet across -- or about the length of five football fields -- the smallest object ever orbited by a spacecraft. It's a critical step in OSIRIS-REx's years-long quest to collect and eventually deliver at least two ounces of regolith -- dirt and rocks -- from Bennu to Earth. Starting in October, OSIRIS-REx performed a series of braking maneuvers to slow the spacecraft down as it approached Bennu. These maneuvers also targeted a trajectory to set up Monday's maneuver, which initiates the first north pole flyover and marks the spacecraft's arrival at Bennu. \"The OSIRIS-REx team is proud to cross another major milestone off our list -- asteroid arrival,\" said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona, Tucson. \"Initial data from the approach phase show this object to have exceptional scientific value. We can't wait to start our exploration of Bennu in earnest. We've been preparing for this moment for years, and we're ready.\" OSIRIS-REx mission marks many firsts in space exploration. It will be the first U.S. mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth and the largest sample returned from space since the Apollo era. It's the first to study a primitive B-type asteroid, which is an asteroid that's rich in carbon and organic molecules that make up life on Earth. It is also the first mission to study a potentially hazardous asteroid and try to determine the factors that alter their courses to bring them close to Earth. \"During our approach toward Bennu, we have taken observations at much higher resolution than were available from Earth,\" said Rich Burns, the project manager of OSIRIS-REx at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"These observations have revealed an asteroid that is both consistent with our expectations from ground-based measurements and an exceptionally interesting small world. Now we embark on gaining experience flying our spacecraft about such a small body.\" When OSIRIS-REx begins to orbit Bennu at the end of this month, it will come close to approximately three quarters of a mile to its surface. In February 2019, the spacecraft begins efforts to globally map Bennu to determine the best site for sample collection. After the collection site is selected, the spacecraft will briefly touch the surface of Bennu to retrieve a sample. OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to return the sample to Earth in September 2023.

NASA Asteroid-Sampling Probe Reaches Its Target Space Rock", "date": "2018-12-03", "content": "The United States' first asteroid-sampling probe has arrived at its target, acing a deep-space rendezvous about 76 million miles from Earth. NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft sidled up to the diamond-shaped asteroid Bennu today at about 12 p.m. EST, wrapping up a circuitous cosmic chase that lasted 27 months. \"#Welcome To Bennu! After two years of travel - and more than a decade of planning and work by my team - I'm here. But Arrival is just the beginning...\" team members wrote today via the mission's Twitter account, OSIRISREx. OSIRIS-REx is now less than 12 miles from Bennu, but the probe is flying along with the space rock rather than orbiting it. Orbital insertion won't come until Dec. 31, after OSIRIS-REx has performed a series of flybys that will bring the probe to within just 4.3 miles or so of Bennu's boulder-strewn surface. During these close encounters, OSIRIS-REx will study Bennu in depth, allowing team members to nail down the 1,650-foot-wide asteroid's mass and precise shape. \"It's really important for us to spend some time gathering that data and making sure that the assumptions we have going into orbit are correct, to reduce the risk of having an inaccurate insertion,\" OSIRIS-REx Deputy Principal Investigator Heather Enos, of the University of Arizona, told Space.com. That orbital insertion will be another groundbreaking moment. For starters, no spacecraft has ever circled an object as small as Bennu. And OSIRIS-REx will get very close, slipping into an orbit just 1 mile above the space rock on Dec. 31. \"We're going to set a record for the closest distance that a spacecraft ever orbited a small body,\" Enos said. \"So, we don't take that lightly, and we do need to do things methodically.\" Orbital insertion, by the way, will occur just one day before NASA's New Horizons probe makes its epic flyby of the frigid, faraway object Ultima Thule. The $800 million OSIRIS-REx mission launched on Sept. 8, 2016, then returned for a speed-boosting \"gravity assist\" flyby of Earth almost exactly one year later. The probe has been closing the gap on Bennu ever since, during a space chase covering more than 1.25 billion miles. OSIRIS-REx will collect a variety of scientific data over the coming months. But the spacecraft will also do quite a bit of scouting work, looking for the best place for swoop down and snag at least 2.1 ounces of Bennu material. This sample-collection maneuver is scheduled to occur in July 2020. If all goes according to plan, OSIRIS-REx will depart Bennu in March 2021, and the sample will come down to Earth in a special return capsule in September 2023. The Bennu bits will be the largest celestial sample brought to Earth by a space mission since the Apollo era, when NASA astronauts lugged hundreds of pounds of moon rocks back to their home planet. Researchers in labs around the globe will then scrutinize the material, searching for clues about the early history of the solar system, and the role that carbon-rich asteroids such as Bennu may have played in helping life get started on Earth long ago. And there's no telling what other discoveries may come from such sample study, mission team members have said. Sample return \"is the gift that keeps on giving,\" Enos said. Scientists are still poring over the Apollo rocks, more than 45 years after the last of them came to Earth, she noted. \"We just keep improving our analytical skills to take things to the subatomic level and really dissect them, so to speak,\" Enos said. OSIRIS-REx has many subsidiary goals in addition to the main objective outlined above. Such diversity and ambition are apparent in the mission's full name: \"Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security- Regolith Explorer.\" For example, OSIRIS-REx's data should shed light on the resource potential of Bennu-like asteroids, providing data of interest to space miners and the human-spaceflight community, mission team members have said. And then there's the \"security\" component. OSIRIS-REx's measurements at Bennu should help scientists better understand how solar heating - or, more precisely, the asymmetrical emission of absorbed solar radiation - can affect asteroids' paths through space. Such information could lead to more-accurate predictions of where potentially hazardous space rocks may be headed, OSIRIS-REx team members have said. Bennu itself falls into this category: There's a very slight chance that the space rock could slam into our planet in the late 22nd century. ## Working together OSIRIS-REx, which was built by aerospace company Lockheed Martin, isn't the only spacecraft exploring a near-Earth asteroid right now. Japan's Hayabusa2 spacecraft has been orbiting the 3,000-foot-wide space rock Ryugu - which shares Bennu's diamond shape - since June and has even dropped a handful of miniprobes onto the asteroid's surface. Hayabusa2 is also a sample-return mission; the probe's return capsule is scheduled to come down to Earth in December 2020. The OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 teams have already been working together, and the collaboration will continue through sample collection, return and analysis. NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency have agreed to share samples with each other, Enos said. \"I think that we're really lucky in the science community and the planetary- exploration community to have two missions going on at the same time,\" she said. \"And although we have a lot of similarities with Hayabusa2, our asteroids are considered to be a very different composition,\" Enos added. \"That in itself is really puzzling and will be exciting to explore.\" Mike Wall's book about the search for alien life, \"Out There\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/42612-nasa-osiris-rex-arrives-asteroid-bennu.html"}, {"title": "NASA spacecraft meets with asteroid", "date": "2018-12-04", "content": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission and the asteroid Bennu have had a date planned for two years, and just after noon ET today, they finally got to meet face to face. OSIRIS-REx fired its thrusters for a small burn, putting it about 4.3 miles from Bennu, marking the end of its journey to the asteroid. The mission - which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer - is NASA's first asteroid sample return mission. It launched in September 2016 and will spend two years up close and personal with Bennu. First images of the asteroid from the spacecraft's perspective have appeared as it got closer and closer. On Tuesday, the spacecraft will fly within 5 miles of Bennu, which will help design future orbits and map the surface. Over the next year, OSIRIS-REx will survey the asteroid using five scientific instruments on board the spacecraft. These instruments will help it determine a safe location from which to collect a small sample from Bennu's surface that will be returned to Earth in September 2023. \"Bennu's low gravity provides a unique challenge for the mission,\" said Rich Burns, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"At roughly 0.3 mile in diameter, Bennu will be the smallest object that any spacecraft has ever orbited.\" The sample from Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid, could help scientists understand not only more about asteroids that could impact Earth but about how planets formed and life began. OSIRIS-REx has a camera suite, a laser altimeter for 3D mapping, a thermal emission spectrometer to take temperature and mineral content and spectrometers to measure X-rays, nearly infrared and visible light. An arm mechanism called TAGSAM will reach out to collect the sample from Bennu's surface, making contact with the asteroid for five seconds in July 2020. During this contact, the arm will use a nitrogen gas burst to stir up rock and other materials on the surface so it can capture them. There is enough nitrogen for three attempts if the first is unsuccessful. NASA said the estimated 2.1-ounce sample size equates to about 30 sugar packets worth of dirt and rocks. The arm has a full range of motion, with joints capable of movement comparable to shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. It was \"flexed\" in space for the first time on November 14. \"The TAGSAM exercise is an important milestone, as the prime objective of the OSIRIS-REx mission is to return a sample of Bennu to Earth,\" said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona, Tucson. \"This successful test shows that, when the time comes, TAGSAM is ready to reach out and tag the asteroid.\" In 2021, it will be time for the spacecraft to essentially turn around and begin its two-year journey home. The sample will be packed into a capsule that will drop in the Utah desert in 2023. For two years after the return, the sample will be cataloged and analyzed. Afterward, 75% of the returned sample will remain at NASA's Johnson Space Flight Center so it can be used for more research by scientists from around the world. Why did NASA select Bennu out of the 780,000 known asteroids in our solar system? It was discovered in 1999, and scientists have been studying it ever since. The asteroid fits a number of criteria that make it intriguing and convenient. Bennu is relatively close to Earth, and its orbit even crosses that of our planet, making a close approach every six years. Though small asteroids can rotate very quickly, Bennu has a diameter just a bit bigger than the height of the Empire State Building and rotates relatively slowly, each 4.3 hours. This means OSIRIS-REx can match its velocity and touch down briefly. The asteroid could pass close to Earth, closer than the moon, in 2135, with even closer approaches possible in 2175 and 2195. A direct hit is unlikely, but the data gathered during this mission can help determine the best ways to deflect near-Earth asteroids. The asteroid is also old and well-preserved, full of valuable materials that may even contain clues about how life began. Bennu is essentially a leftover from the formation of our solar system billions of years ago, although some of the minerals inside it could be even older. This carbon-rich asteroid could be full of organic molecules, metals, platinum and even water - the essential ingredients for life. It's because of objects like Bennu that these resources were delivered to Earth during its formation. Asteroids could even serve as fuel stations for robotic and human missions if we can unlock the hydrogen and oxygen inside them, NASA said. Bennu probably broke off of a larger asteroid in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter a couple billion years ago. This knocked it through space until an orbit close to Earth locked it in place. And Bennu is believed to be a grouping of rocks held together by gravity rather than a single object. But its orbit drifts 0.18 miles each year toward the sun, and OSIRIS-REx will enable researchers to understand why and to predict Bennu's movements. This could also explain how it ended up as a near-Earth asteroid. \"The story of this asteroid is the story of the solar system,\" said Bashar Rizk, instrument scientist for OSIRIS-REx. \"When we understand Bennu, we will understand something fundamental about our solar system.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/03/world/osiris-rex-bennu-asteroid-mission-rendezvous/index.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA spacecraft breaks record for smallest space object ever orbited", "date": "2019-01-01", "content": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft broke a record after successfully entering into orbit around the asteroid Bennu - the smallest cosmic object ever to be orbited by a spacecraft.

The manoeuvre placed the spacecraft into orbit around the asteroid Bennu. \"The team continued our long string of successes by executing the orbit- insertion maneuver perfectly,\" said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona in the U.S. \"With the navigation campaign coming to an end, we are looking forward to the scientific mapping and sample site selection phase of the mission,\" said Mr. Lauretta. \"Entering orbit around Bennu is an amazing accomplishment that our team has been planning for years,\" he said.

The spacecraft will circle Bennu about 1.75 kilometres from its centre, closer than any other spacecraft has come to its celestial object of study. Previously the closest orbit of a planetary body was in May 2016, when the Rosetta spacecraft orbited about seven kilometers from the center of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The comfortable distance is necessary to keep the spacecraft locked to Bennu, which has a gravity force only 5-millionths as strong as Earth's.

OSIRIS-REx will remain in orbit until mid-February 2019 when the spacecraft will begin a series of flybys that allow it to conduct a more detailed survey of the asteroid's surface. It will enter orbit a second time in mid-2019. Now that the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is closer to Bennu, physical details about the asteroid will leap into sharper focus, and the spacecraft's tour of this rubble pile of primordial debris will become increasingly detailed and focused. \"Our orbit design is highly dependent on Bennu's physical properties, such as its mass and gravity field, which we didn't know before we arrived,\" said OSIRIS-REx's flight dynamics system manager Mike Moreau, who is based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Up until now, we had to account for a wide variety of possible scenarios in our computer simulations to make sure we could safely navigate the spacecraft so close to Bennu.

The OSIRIS-REx mission, after all, was designed based on complex computer programs that predicted - quite accurately, as it turns out - the properties of Bennu and how the spacecraft's trajectory would behave. This diligent preparation allowed the team to navigate the vehicle safely to Bennu in December and put some questions to rest and to fly over its poles and equator in a preliminary survey that led to some surprises. Having completed the preliminary survey of Bennu with a flyby of its south pole on December 16, the spacecraft moved to a safe 31 miles away from the asteroid to give the navigation team a chance to regroup and prepare for orbit insertion. Next, Lockheed Martin engineers programmed the spacecraft to begin moving back to a position about nine miles over Bennu's north pole to prepare for three burns of its thrusters over the course of 10 days that would place the spacecraft into orbit. Even though OSIRIS-REx is in the most stable orbit possible, Bennu's gravitational pull is so tenuous that keeping the spacecraft safe will require occasional adjustments, said Dan Wibben, OSIRIS-REx maneuver and trajectory design lead at KinetX Aerospace in Simi Valley, California. \"The gravity of Bennu is so small, forces like solar radiation and thermal pressure from Bennu's surface become much more relevant and can push the spacecraft around in its orbit much more than if it were orbiting around Earth or Mars, where gravity is by far the most dominant force,\" he said. The OSIRIS-REx navigation team will use \"trim\" maneuvers to slightly thrust the spacecraft in one direction or another to correct its orbit and counter these small forces. If the spacecraft drifts away from Bennu, or some other problem forces it into safe mode, it has been programmed to fly away from the asteroid to stay safe from impact. \"It's simple logic: always burn toward the Sun if something goes wrong,\" said Coralie Adam, OSIRIS-REx lead optical navigation engineer at KinetX. Engineers can navigate the spacecraft back into orbit if it drifts away, Adam said, though that's unlikely to happen. The navigation and spacecraft operations teams are focused on the first orbital phase. Their primary goal is to transition away from star-based navigation, which allowed the team to locate the spacecraft based on pictures of the star formations around it taken by the cameras onboard. Navigators use methods like this since there is no GPS in deep space and we can't see the spacecraft from Earth-based telescopes. From this point forward, though, the OSIRIS-REx team will rely on landmarks on Bennu's surface to track OSIRIS-REx, a more precise technique that will ultimately guide them to a sample- collection site clear of boulders and large rocks, said Adam. \"After conducting a global imaging and mapping campaign during our recent preliminary survey phase, the science team has created 3-D models of Bennu's terrain that we're going to begin using for navigation around the asteroid,\" she said. Another critical objective of this orbital phase, Adam said, is to get a better handle on Bennu's mass and gravity, features that will influence the planning of the rest of the mission, notably the short touchdown on the surface for sample collection in 2020. In the case of Bennu, scientists can only measure these features by getting OSIRIS-REx very close to the surface to see how its trajectory bends from Bennu's gravitational pull. \"The Orbital A phase will help improve our detailed models for Bennu's gravity field, thermal properties, orientation, and spin rate,\" said Wibben. \"This, in turn, will allow us to refine our trajectory designs for the even more challenging flight activities we will perform in 2019.\" The December 31 maneuver to place the spacecraft into orbit about Bennu is the first of many exciting navigation activities planned for the mission.

The probe will stay in this superclose orbit, a phase known as Orbital B, until the second week of August, mission team members said. For the next two weeks, OSIRIS-REx will photograph Bennu's horizon frequently, to help mission scientists better understand the strange particle-ejection events the probe observed earlier this year. Over the final five weeks of Orbital-B, the probe will map Bennu in detail using most of its science instruments. \"All of these measurements are essential for selecting the best sample- collection site on Bennu's surface,\" OSIRIS-REx team members wrote in an update today . At the end of Orbital-B, the spacecraft will raise its orbit to 0.8 miles once again, kicking off the Orbital-C campaign.

The ongoing examination of Bennu - and its sample that will eventually be returned to Earth - could potentially shed light on why this intriguing phenomenon is occurring. The OSIRIS-REx team first observed a particle-ejection event in images captured by the spacecraft's navigation cameras taken on Jan. 6, just a week after the spacecraft entered its first orbit around Bennu. At first glance, the particles appeared to be stars behind the asteroid, but on closer examination, the team realized that the asteroid was ejecting material from its surface. After concluding that these particles did not compromise the spacecraft's safety, the mission began dedicated observations in order to fully document the activity. This animation illustrates the modeled trajectories of particles that were ejected from Bennu's surface on January 19. After ejecting from the asteroid's surface, the particles either briefly orbited Bennu and fell back to its surface or escaped away from Bennu and into space. \"Among Bennu's many surprises, the particle ejections sparked our curiosity, and we've spent the last several months investigating this mystery,\" said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \"This is a great opportunity to expand our knowledge of how asteroids behave.\" After studying the results of the observations, the mission team released their findings in a Science paper published Dec. 6. The team observed the three largest particle-ejection events on Jan. 6 and 19, and Feb. 11, and concluded that the events originated from different locations on Bennu's surface. The first event originated in the southern hemisphere, and the second and third events occurred near the equator. All three events took place in the late afternoon on Bennu. The team found that, after ejection from the asteroid's surface, the particles either briefly orbited Bennu and fell back to its surface or escaped from Bennu into space. The observed particles traveled up to 10 feet per second, and measured from smaller than an inch up to 4 inches in size. Approximately 200 particles were observed during the largest event, which took place on Jan. 6. The team investigated a wide variety of possible mechanisms that may have caused the ejection events and narrowed the list to three candidates: meteoroid impacts, thermal stress fracturing and released water vapor. Meteoroid impacts are common in the deep space neighborhood of Bennu, and it is possible that these small fragments of space rock could be hitting Bennu where OSIRIS-REx is not observing it, shaking loose particles with the momentum of their impact. The team also determined that thermal fracturing is another reasonable explanation. Bennu's surface temperatures vary drastically over its 4.3-hour rotation period. Although it is extremely cold during the night hours, the asteroid's surface warms significantly in the mid-afternoon, which is when the three major events occurred. As a result of this temperature change, rocks may begin to crack and break down, and eventually particles could be ejected from the surface. This cycle is known as thermal stress fracturing. Water release may also explain the asteroid's activity. When Bennu's water- locked clays are heated, the water could begin to release and create pressure. It is possible that as pressure builds in cracks and pores in boulders where absorbed water is released, the surface could become agitated, causing particles to erupt. But nature does not always allow for simple explanations. \"It could be that more than one of these possible mechanisms are at play,\" said Steve Chesley, an author on the paper and Senior Research Scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"For example, thermal fracturing could be chopping the surface material into small pieces, making it far easier for meteoroid impacts to launch pebbles into space.\" If thermal fracturing, meteoroid impacts or both are in fact the causes of these ejection events, then this phenomenon is likely happening on all small asteroids, as they all experience these mechanisms. However, if water release is the cause of these ejection events, then this phenomenon would be specific to asteroids that contain water-bearing minerals, like Bennu. Bennu's activity presents larger opportunities once a sample is collected and returned to Earth for study. Many of the ejected particles are small enough to be collected by the spacecraft's sampling mechanism, meaning that the returned sample may possibly contain some material that was ejected and returned to Bennu's surface. Determining that a particular particle had been ejected and returned to Bennu might be a scientific feat similar to finding a needle in a haystack. The material returned to Earth from Bennu, however, will almost certainly increase our understanding of asteroids and the ways they are both different and similar, even as the particle-ejection phenomenon continues to be a mystery whose clues we'll also return home with in the form of data and further material for study. Sample collection is scheduled for summer 2020, and the sample will be delivered to Earth in September 2023.

NASA said that its Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security - Regolith Explorer, or OSIRIS-REx, spacecraft will gather samples from a crater on the asteroid Bennu dubbed Nightingale, located in the northern latitudes of the asteroid. That sampling attempt is currently scheduled for August 2020. Nightingale was one of four sites on the asteroid that scientists had selected as finalists to be the location where the spacecraft would approach the surface and, using a sample collection tool mounted on the end of a robotic arm, touch the surface briefly to collect rock and soil samples before moving away. \"This one really came out on top because of the scientific value,\" said Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx, during a NASA broadcast that announced the site. The site selection process was more challenging than the mission originally expected. When OSIRIS-REx arrived at Bennu in 2018, the spacecraft's images revealed an asteroid whose surface was littered with boulders that would be hazards for any sampling attempt, making it difficult to find a location that was both of scientific interest and safe enough for the spacecraft to approach. Lauretta said the high latitude of the Nightingale site means that it avoids the night-and-day temperature swings of locations closer to the asteroid's equator, preserving organic and water-bearing minerals there. \"Being in those high latitudes, we think, gives us the best chance to preserve that kind of material,\" he said. The site, though, will also be a challenge for any sampling attempt. Lauretta said large boulders in the area, including one dubbed \"Mount Doom,\" pose obstructions to the spacecraft as it approaches. \"We're trying to get into a crater that's on the order of a few parking lot spaces wide,\" he said. \"We're aware we have hazards around us, so precision navigation to that sample material is our biggest challenge.\" That's led to changes in the spacecraft's flight control software. \"We've had to make some changes to the capabilities of the spacecraft to allow us to navigate into a site like Nightingale,\" said Mike Moreau, OSIRIS-REx deputy project manager. That includes creating a \"hazard map\" of the site based on images of it, which the spacecraft will use to determine if it is coming too close to a boulder and, if so, back away. Should the Nightingale site prove to be too hazardous to collect a sample from, Lauretta said the mission selected another crater close to the equator, called Osprey, as a backup site. \"We know we can get in there,\" he said, although once into Osprey it may be more difficult to collect the sample itself. OSIRIS-REx will depart the vicinity of Bennu in 2021 after collecting between 60 grams and two kilograms of samples. It will return to Earth in September 2023, with the sample return container landing at the Utah Test and Training Range.

The preferred site, known as Nightingale, provides the best balance between risk and scientific reward, researchers say, offering an opportunity to collect organic and water-bearing material from the early solar system. But it will be a challenge for spacecraft navigators. A mound of boulders dubbed \"Mount Doom\" rises to one side of the sample site, an obstruction that OSIRIS-REx must avoid to execute a \"touch-and-go\" collection. \"It's a substantial, building-size obstruction, and we're trying to get into a crater that's on the order of a few parking lot spaces wide,\" said Dante Lauretta, the OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona. \"So we are doing a really tight job parking. We're aware that we have hazards around us. So precision navigation to that sample material is our biggest challenge.\" The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security- Regolith Explorer - OSIRIS-REx - was launched from Cape Canaveral in September 2016 and braked into orbit around Bennu two years later. The spacecraft is equipped with a \"Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism,\" or TAGSAM, device on the end of a 10-foot-long robot arm. The collect samples, OSIRIS-REx will slowly move in toward Bennu, briefly pressing the pie pan- shaped TAGSAM collector against the asteroid's surface. A jet of nitrogen gas will stir up soil and small rocks that will then be snagged by TAGSAM's collector. The material will be placed in a sample return container for a two-and-a-half-year flight back to Earth. The challenge for mission planners is Bennu's rubble-pile surface. The asteroid is covered in rocks and rocky fragments, most too large to be collected by OSIRIS-REx. \"When we first got there, the most obvious feature that we saw were these abundant, very large boulders and overall a rough and rugged surface very different than what we designed the spacecraft to sample,\" Lauretta said. \"We were sampling areas that were 25 metres across, and quite honestly, I thought it was going to be obvious from the first images where the sample regions were and that it was going to be a straightforward site selection. And it was nothing of the sort.\" Nightingale was selected from four finalist sample sites. \"We recognise that this does have some hazards around it, and so we are doing a lot of work to make sure that we're targeting the safe regions,\" said Lauretta. \"But this one really came out on top because of the scientific value.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2019/12/16/osiris-rex-sample-collection-site-selected-on-asteroid-bennu/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "OSIRIS-REx Swoops Over Sample Site Nightingale on Asteroid Bennu", "date": "2020-03-05", "content": "NASA's first asteroid-sampling spacecraft just got its best look yet at asteroid Bennu. Yesterday, the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer spacecraft executed a very low pass over sample site Nightingale, taking observations from an altitude of 820 feet, which is the closest that OSIRIS-REx has flown over the asteroid so far. Nightingale, OSIRIS-REx's primary sample collection site, is located within a crater in Bennu's northern hemisphere. To perform the 5-hour flyover, the spacecraft left its 0.6-mile safe- home orbit and aimed its science instruments toward the 52-ft wide sample site. The science observations from this pass are the closest taken of Bennu to date. The main goal of yesterday's low flyover was to collect high-resolution imagery of the site's surface material. The spacecraft's sample collection mechanism is designed to pick up small rocks less than 0.8 inches in size, and the PolyCam images from this low pass are very detailed, allowing the team to identify and locate rocks of this size. Several of the spacecraft's other instruments also took observations of the Nightingale site during the flyover event, including the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emissions Spectrometer, the OSIRIS-REx Visual and InfraRed Spectrometer, the OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter, and the MapCam color imager. After completing the flyover, the spacecraft returned to orbit - but for the first time, OSIRIS-REx reversed the direction of its safe-home orbit and is now circling Bennu clockwise. This shift in orbital direction positioned the spacecraft for its next close encounter with the asteroid - its first rehearsal for the sample collection event. This spring, the mission will perform two rehearsals in preparation for the sample collection event. The first rehearsal, scheduled for April 14, navigates the spacecraft down to 410 feet over Bennu's surface. At this altitude, the spacecraft will execute the Checkpoint maneuver, designed to put the spacecraft on a descent trajectory toward the sample collection site on the surface. The spacecraft will stop its descent ten minutes later at an altitude of approximately 164 ft by executing a maneuver to back away from the asteroid. The second rehearsal, scheduled for June, follows the same trajectory but takes the spacecraft to a lower altitude of 164 feet, where it will perform the Matchpoint maneuver, designed to slow the spacecraft's descent rate. Subsequent to this burn the spacecraft will execute a back away maneuver between 131 ft and 82 ft from Bennu's surface. The spacecraft will venture all the way to the asteroid's surface in late August, for its first attempt to collect a sample. During this event, OSIRIS-REx's sampling mechanism will touch Bennu's surface and fire a charge of pressurized nitrogen to disturb the surface and collect its sample before the spacecraft backs away. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, provides overall mission management, systems engineering, and the safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx. Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona, Tucson, is the principal investigator, and the University of Arizona also leads the science team and the mission's science observation planning and data processing. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built the spacecraft and provides flight operations. Goddard and KinetX Aerospace are responsible for navigating the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft.

The spacecraft arrived at Bennu at the end of 2018, and for just over a year it's been studying the asteroid, searching for a suitable sampling site. To do that, it's getting closer and closer. OSIRIS-REx stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer. The heart of the mission is the sample it'll collect from asteroid Bennu. That sample will eventually make its way back to Earth for study. The OSIRIS-REx team selected a sampling site very carefully. When the spacecraft arrived at asteroid Bennu, NASA found that the surface of the asteroid was more challenging than they thought. Though the surface contains an abundance of the right sized material for the spacecraft's sampling mechanism, there are plenty of hazards to be avoided. Eventually, the OSIRIS-REx team came up with a list of four potential sampling sites. They then did more fly-overs of the four, to take an even closer look. From there, they chose two sampling sites: a primary site and a secondary site. All four of the sites received avian-themed names, and at the end of the process, NASA chose Nightingale as the primary site, and Osprey as the backup site. Throughout the site selection process, OSIRIS-REx reconned Bennu in three phases: Recon A, B, and C. During each phase, it got progressively closer to the surface, gathering more detail on each site. Now, in recon phase C, the spacecraft has performed its closest flyover yet. On March 3rd, it flew over Nightingale at an altitude of only 250 meters. The spacecraft's safe-orbit height is one km, but for about five hours, OSIRIS-REx left that safety behind. The Nightingale site is in a crater, and it's about 16 meters wide. During the maneuver, all of the science instruments were aimed at the sampling site. While all of the science instruments were operating, this flyover is mostly about the spacecraft's PolyCam imager. PolyCam is a 20.3-cm telescope, and the closer it gets to Bennu, the higher resolution images it acquires. After the flyover OSIRIS-REx returned to its safe home orbit, but in the opposite direction. Now it's ready for its next big maneuver, the sampling rehearsal. There'll be two sampling rehearsals, and the first one is scheduled for April 15. The spacecraft will make its closest approach then, coming to within 125 meters of Bennu's surface. But it's not done there. At that altitude it'll perform what's called the Checkpoint maneuver. It'll descend even closer to the Nightingale site, and after descending for about 10 minutes, it'll stop its descent at 50 meters and begin backing away from the asteroid. OSIRIS-REx will perform two sampling rehearsals. Then in June OSIRIS-REx will perform its second rehearsal. But this time, it'll get just a little closer, to between 25 to 40 meters before backing away. As OSIRIS-REx performs each approach, it'll be gathering more data on the sampling site. It'll also be \"training\" its Natural Feature Tracking system. The NFT uses images of Bennu's surface to guide itself, comparing onboard images with real-time camera input to avoid hazards and nail its sampling operation. The actual sampling maneuver is scheduled for late August 2020. At that time, OSIRIS-REx will come close enough that its sampling mechanism touches the surface. Then it'll fire a charge of nitrogen gas to kick-up some regolith, and capture some of it. Then it'll back away. Mission operators won't be surprised if the spacecraft's NFT system cancels the sampling attempt. The system has a built-in fail-safe. OSIRIS-REx can perform multiple sampling attempts, so there's no need to commit to a maneuver that is deemed unsafe by the spacecraft's automated systems. If the first attempt at Nightingale doesn't work, OSIRIS-REx can either try and collect from Nightingale again, or move to the backup site, Osprey. Eventually, if all goes well, OSIRIS-REx will return to Earth and release the Sample Return Capsule into Earth's atmosphere, where it will deploy a parachute and float down to the surface. It's expected to land at the Utah Testing and Training Range, where it will be retrieved.

OSIRIS-REx, which has been orbiting Bennu since 2018, is scheduled to attempt to swoop down to the surface to retrieve a sample of the asteroid four months from now and bring that sample back to Earth in 2023. On Tuesday (April 14), during what NASA calls a \"checkpoint rehearsal,\" OSIRIS-REx got closer to Bennu's surface than ever before while practicing the sample collection process. \"This rehearsal let us verify flight system performance during the descent, particularly the autonomous update and execution of the Checkpoint burn,\" Rich Burns, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement. In its first practice run, OSIRIS-REx went through two of the four maneuvers it would perform during a real asteroid-sampling attempt: the orbit departure burn and the \"checkpoint\" burn. First, the spacecraft fired its engines to leave its 0.6-mile (1 kilometer) orbit around Bennu and descend closer to the space rock's surface. About four hours later, when OSIRIS-REx was at an approximate altitude of 410 feet (125 meters), it performed the checkpoint burn, which sent the spacecraft in a trajectory toward the location of its third maneuver, called the \"matchpoint\" burn. But instead of proceeding to that third step, the spacecraft backed away after a nine-minute descent. It reached an altitude of just 246 feet (75 m) - its closest approach yet - before heading back to orbit. Not only did OSIRIS-REx successfully execute these two test maneuvers, but it also practiced deploying its sampling arm, known as the Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism, or TAGSAM. The spacecraft's cameras and sensors also took advantage of the close approach to collect data on the sampling site, which NASA recently dubbed Nightingale. NASA plans to conduct its first sampling attempt at the Nightingale site on Aug. 25, and the spacecraft is scheduled to begin its 2.5-year journey back to Earth in March 2021.", "url": "https://www.space.com/osiris-rex-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection-rehearsal.html"}, {"title": "NASA One Step Closer to Touching Asteroid Bennu and Collecting a Sample to Return to Earth", "date": "2020-04-21", "content": "After the successful completion of its \"Checkpoint\" rehearsal, NASA's first asteroid-sampling spacecraft is one step closer to touching down on asteroid Bennu. On April 14, NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft performed the first practice run of its sample collection sequence, reaching an approximate altitude of 246 feet over site Nightingale before executing a back-away burn from the asteroid. Nightingale, OSIRIS-REx's primary sample collection site, is located within a crater in Bennu's northern hemisphere. The four-hour Checkpoint rehearsal took the spacecraft through the first two of the sampling sequence's four maneuvers: the orbit departure burn and the Checkpoint burn. Checkpoint is so named because it is the location where the spacecraft autonomously checks its position and velocity before adjusting its trajectory down toward the location of the event's third maneuver. This series of images, captured on April 14 during the first rehearsal of the OSIRIS-REx mission's sample collection event, shows the SamCam instrument's field of view as the spacecraft approaches and moves away from asteroid Bennu's surface. The rehearsal brought the spacecraft through the first two maneuvers of the sampling event to a point approximately 213 feet above the surface, before backing the spacecraft away. These images were recorded over a ten-minute span between the execution of the rehearsal's \"Checkpoint\" burn, approximately 394 feet above the surface, and the completion of the back-away burn, which occurred approximately 213 feet above the surface. The spacecraft's sampling arm - called the Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism - is visible in the central part of the frame, and the relatively clear, dark patch of Bennu's sample site Nightingale is visible in the later images, at the top. The large, dark boulder that the spacecraft approaches during the sequence is 43 feet on its longest axis. The sequence was created using over 30 images taken by the spacecraft's SamCam camera. For context, the images are oriented with Bennu's west at the top. During the sample collection event, which is scheduled for August, the SamCam imager will continuously document the entire event and touchdown maneuver. Four hours after departing its 0.6-mile safe-home orbit, the spacecraft performed the Checkpoint maneuver at an approximate altitude of 410 feet above Bennu's surface. From there, the spacecraft continued to descend for another nine minutes on a trajectory toward - but not reaching - the location of the sampling event's third maneuver, the \"Matchpoint\" burn. Upon reaching an altitude of approximately 246 ft - the closest the spacecraft has ever been to Bennu - OSIRIS-REx performed a back-away burn to complete the rehearsal. During the rehearsal, the spacecraft successfully deployed its sampling arm, the Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism, from its folded, parked position out to the sample collection configuration. Additionally, some of the spacecraft's instruments collected science and navigation images and made spectrometry observations of the sample site, as will occur during the sample collection event. This first rehearsal provided the mission team with practice navigating the spacecraft through both the orbit departure and Checkpoint maneuvers and with an opportunity to verify that the spacecraft's imaging, navigation and ranging systems operated as expected during the first part of the descent sequence. Checkpoint rehearsal also gave the team confirmation that OSIRIS-REx's Natural Feature Tracking guidance system accurately estimated the spacecraft's position and speed relative to Bennu as it descended toward the surface. The mission team has maximized remote work over the last month of preparations for the Checkpoint rehearsal, as part of the COVID-19 response. On the day of rehearsal, a limited number of personnel monitored the spacecraft's telemetry from Lockheed Martin Space's facility, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Arizona, taking appropriate safety precautions, while the rest of the team performed their roles remotely. \"This rehearsal let us verify flight system performance during the descent, particularly the autonomous update and execution of the Checkpoint burn,\" said Rich Burns, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Executing this monumental milestone during this time of national crisis is a testament to the professionalism and focus of our team. It speaks volumes about their 'can-do' attitude and hopefully will serve as a bit of good news in these challenging times.\" The spacecraft will travel all the way to the asteroid's surface during its first sample collection attempt, scheduled for August 25. During this event, OSIRIS-REx's sampling mechanism will touch Bennu's surface for approximately five seconds, fire a charge of pressurized nitrogen to disturb the surface and collect a sample before the spacecraft backs away.

The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security - Regolith Explorer mission has targeted October 20, 2020, for its first sample collection attempt. \"The OSIRIS-REx mission has been demonstrating the very essence of exploration by persevering through unexpected challenges,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for science. \"That spirit has led them to the cusp of the prize we all are waiting for - securing a sample of an asteroid to bring home to Earth, and I'm very excited to follow them through the home stretch.\" From discovering Bennu's surprisingly rugged and active surface, to entering the closest-ever orbit around a planetary body, OSIRIS-REx has overcome several challenges since arriving at the asteroid in December 2018. Last month, the mission brought the spacecraft 213 ft from the asteroid's surface during its first sample collection rehearsal - successfully completing a practice run of the activities leading up to the sampling event. Now that the mission is ready to collect a sample, the team is facing a different kind of challenge here on Earth. In response to COVID-19 constraints and after the intense preparation for the first rehearsal, the OSIRIS-REx mission has decided to provide its team with additional preparation time for both the final rehearsal and the sample collection event. Spacecraft activities require significant lead time for the development and testing of operations, and given the current requirements that limit in-person participation at the mission support area, the mission would benefit from giving the team additional time to complete these preparations in the new environment. As a result, both the second rehearsal and first sample collection attempt will have two extra months for planning. \"In planning the mission, we included robust schedule margin while at Bennu to provide the flexibility to address unexpected challenges,\" said Rich Burns, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"This flexibility has allowed us to adapt to the surprises that Bennu has thrown at us. It's now time to prioritize the health and safety of both team members and the spacecraft.\" The mission had originally planned to perform the first Touch-and-Go sample collection event on August 25 after completing a second rehearsal in June. This rehearsal, now scheduled for August 11, will bring the spacecraft through the first three maneuvers of the sample collection sequence to an approximate altitude of 131 ft over the surface of Bennu. The first sample collection attempt is now scheduled for October 20, during which the spacecraft will descend to Bennu's surface and collect material from sample site Nightingale. \"This mission's incredible performance so far is a testament to the extraordinary skill and dedication of the OSIRIS-REx team,\" said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona, Tucson. \"I am confident that even in the face of the current challenge, this team will be successful in collecting our sample from Bennu.\" During the TAG event, OSIRIS-REx's sampling mechanism will touch Bennu's surface for approximately five seconds, fire a charge of pressurized nitrogen to disturb the surface, and collect a sample before the spacecraft backs away. The mission has resources onboard for three sample collection opportunities. If the spacecraft successfully collects a sufficient sample on October 20, no additional sampling attempts will be made. The spacecraft is scheduled to depart Bennu in mid-2021, and will return the sample to Earth on September 24, 2023.

Next week, the OSIRIS-REx mission will conduct a second rehearsal of its touchdown sequence, practicing the sample collection activities one last time before touching down on Bennu this fall. On August 11, the mission will perform its \"Matchpoint\" rehearsal - the second practice run of the Touch-and-Go sample collection event. The rehearsal will be similar to the April 14 \"Checkpoint\" rehearsal, which practiced the first two maneuvers of the descent, but this time the spacecraft will add a third maneuver, called the Matchpoint burn, and fly even closer to sample site Nightingale - reaching an altitude of approximately 131 ft - before backing away from the asteroid. This second rehearsal will be the first time the spacecraft executes the Matchpoint maneuver to then fly in tandem with Bennu's rotation. The rehearsal also gives the team a chance to become more familiar navigating the spacecraft through all of the descent maneuvers, while verifying that the spacecraft's imaging, navigation and ranging systems operate as expected during the event. During the descent, the spacecraft fires its thrusters three separate times to make its way down to the asteroid's surface. The spacecraft will travel at an average speed of around 0.2 mph during the approximately four-hour excursion. Matchpoint rehearsal begins with OSIRIS-REx firing its thrusters to leave its 0.5-mile safe-home orbit. The spacecraft then extends its robotic sampling arm - the Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism - from its folded, parked position out to the sample collection configuration. Immediately following, the spacecraft rotates to begin collecting navigation images for the Natural Feature Tracking guidance system. NFT allows OSIRIS-REx to autonomously navigate to Bennu's surface by comparing an onboard image catalog with the real-time navigation images taken during descent. As the spacecraft approaches the surface, the NFT system updates the spacecraft's predicted point of contact depending on OSIRIS-REx's position in relation to Bennu's landmarks. The spacecraft's two solar panels then move into a \"Y-wing\" configuration that safely positions them up and away from the asteroid's surface. This configuration also places the spacecraft's center of gravity directly over the TAGSAM collector head, which is the only part of the spacecraft that will contact Bennu's surface during the sample collection event. When OSIRIS-REx reaches an altitude of approximately 410 ft, it performs the Checkpoint burn and descends more steeply toward Bennu's surface for another eight minutes. At approximately 164 ft above the asteroid, the spacecraft fires its thrusters a third time for the Matchpoint burn. This maneuver slows the spacecraft's rate of descent and adjusts its trajectory to match Bennu's rotation as the spacecraft makes final corrections to target the touchdown spot. OSIRIS-REx will continue capturing images of Bennu's landmarks for the NFT system to update the spacecraft's trajectory for another three minutes of descent. This brings OSIRIS-REx to its targeted destination around 131 ft from Bennu - the closest it has ever been to the asteroid. With the rehearsal complete, the spacecraft executes a back-away burn, returns its solar panels to their original position and reconfigures the TAGSAM arm back to the parked position. During the rehearsal, the one-way light time for signals to travel between Earth and the spacecraft will be approximately 16 minutes, which prevents the live commanding of flight activities from the ground. So prior to the rehearsal's start, the OSIRIS-REx team will uplink all of the event's commands to the spacecraft, allowing OSIRIS-REx to perform the rehearsal sequence autonomously after the GO command is given. Also during the event, the spacecraft's low gain antenna will be its only antenna pointing toward Earth, transmitting data at the very slow rate of 40 bits per second. So while the OSIRIS-REx team will be able to monitor the spacecraft's vital signs, the images and science data collected during the event won't be downlinked until the rehearsal is complete. The team will experience these same circumstances during the actual TAG event in October. Following Matchpoint rehearsal, the OSIRIS-REx team will verify the flight system's performance during the descent, including that the Matchpoint burn accurately adjusted the spacecraft's descent trajectory for its touchdown on Bennu. Once the mission team determines that OSIRIS-REx operated as expected, they will command the spacecraft to return to its safe-home orbit around Bennu. The mission team has spent the last several months preparing for the Matchpoint rehearsal while maximizing remote work as part of its COVID-19 response. On the day of rehearsal, a limited number of personnel will monitor the spacecraft from Lockheed Martin Space's facility, taking appropriate safety precautions, while the rest of the team performs their roles remotely. The mission implemented a similar protocol during the Checkpoint rehearsal in April. On October 20, the spacecraft will travel all the way to the asteroid's surface during its first sample collection attempt. During this event, OSIRIS- REx's sampling mechanism will touch Bennu's surface for approximately five seconds, fire a charge of pressurized nitrogen to disturb the surface and collect a sample before the spacecraft backs away.

The attempt, which happened Wednesday morning Australian time, is the first time the US has tried to collect asteroid samples for return to Earth. So far, only Japan has achieved this. The Osiris-Rex mission is looking to bring back at least 60g worth of asteroid Bennu, the biggest haul from beyond the Moon. While NASA has confirmed the mission looked like it was a success, it won't know how much was collected for about a week. The van-sized spacecraft aimed for the relatively flat middle of a tennis court-sized crater named Nightingale. Boulders as big as buildings loom over the targeted touchdown zone. \"So for some perspective, the next time you park your car in front of your house or in front of a coffee shop and walk inside, think about the challenge of navigating Osiris-Rex into one of these spots from 200 million miles away,\" said NASA's deputy project manager Mike Moreau. Once it dropped out of its 750m-high orbit around Bennu, the spacecraft took about four hours to carefully and slowly make it all the way down, to just above the surface. Then the action cranked up when Osiris-Rex's 3.4m arm reached out and touched Bennu. Before the mission, experts predicted contact would last five to 10 seconds, just long enough to shoot out pressurised nitrogen gas and suck up the churned* dirt and gravel. The spacecraft was programmed in advance and operated autonomously during the manoeuvre*. With an 18-minute lag in radio communication each way, ground controllers for spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin near Denver, US, couldn't intervene. If the first attempt doesn't work, Osiris-Rex can try again. Any collected samples won't reach Earth until 2023. While NASA has brought back comet dust and solar wind particles, it's never attempted to sample one of the nearly 1 million known asteroids lurking* in our solar system until now. Japan, meanwhile, expects to get samples from asteroid Ryugu in December - in the milligrams* at most - 10 years after bringing back specks from asteroid Itokawa. Bennu is a valuable asteroid from which to collect a sample. The big, black, roundish, carbon-rich space rock was around when our solar system was forming 4.5 billion years ago. Scientists consider it a time capsule full of pristine* materials that could help explain how life formed on Earth and possibly elsewhere. \"This is all about understanding our origins,\" said the mission's principal scientist, Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona, US. There also are selfish reasons for getting to know Bennu better. The solar-orbiting asteroid, which swings by Earth every six years, could take aim at us late in the next century. NASA puts the odds of an impact at 1-in-2700. The more scientists know about asteroids such as Bennu, the safer Earth will be. When Osiris-Rex blasted off in 2016, scientists envisioned* sandy areas on Bennu's surface. So the spacecraft was designed to ingest* small pebbles less than 2cm across. Scientists were stunned to find massive rocks and chunky gravel all over the place when the spacecraft arrived in 2018. And pebbles were occasionally seen shooting off the asteroid, falling back and sometimes bouncing off again in a game of space ping pong. With so much rough terrain, engineers scrambled to aim for a tighter spot than originally predicted. Nightingale Crater, the prime target, appears to have the biggest abundance* of fine grains, but there are still many boulders, including one named Mount Doom. Osiris-Rex has three bottles of nitrogen gas, which means it can touch down three times - no more. The spacecraft automatically will back away during a collection attempt if it meets unexpected hazards like big rocks that could cause it to tip over. And there's a chance it could have touched down safely, but failed to collect enough rubble. In either case, the spacecraft could return to orbit around Bennu and try again in January at another location. Before the first try, Professor Lauretta was worried, nervous, excited \"and confident we have done everything possible to ensure a safe sampling.\" ", "url": "https://www.kidsnews.com.au/space/nasa-all-set-to-snatch-asteroid-rubble/news-story/92231d1c92762838cd4a963b7718159f"}, {"title": "NASA Releases Incredible Video of OSIRIS-REx Tagging Asteroid - Mysterious Dark Patches Puzzle Team", "date": "2020-11-03", "content": "Captured on October 20, 2020, during the OSIRIS-REx mission's sample collection event, this series of images shows the navigation camera's field of view as the NASA spacecraft approaches, touches, and moves away from asteroid Bennu's surface. The sampling event brought the spacecraft all the way down to sample site Nightingale, and the team on Earth received confirmation of successful touchdown at 6:08 pm EDT. Preliminary data show the sampling head touched Bennu's surface for approximately 6 seconds, after which the spacecraft performed a back-away burn. These images were captured over an approximate three-hour period - the imaging sequence begins approximately one hour after the orbit departure maneuver and ends approximately two minutes after the back-away burn. In the middle of the sequence, the spacecraft slews, or rotates, so that NavCam 2 looks away from Bennu, toward space. OSIRIS-REx then performs a final slew to point the camera toward the surface again. As the spacecraft nears site Nightingale, the sampling arm's shadow comes into view in the lower part of the frame. Shortly after, the sampling head impacts site Nightingale and fires a nitrogen gas bottle, which mobilizes a substantial amount of the sample site's material. Several seconds later, the spacecraft performs a back- away burn and the sampling arm's shadow is visible against the disturbed surface material. The team continues to investigate what caused the extremely dark areas visible in the upper and middle parts of the frame. The upper area could be the edge of the depression created by the sampling arm, a strong shadow cast by material lofted from the surface, or some combination of the two. Similarly, the middle dark region that first appears in the lower left of the image could be a depression caused by one of the spacecraft thrusters as it fired, a shadow caused by lofted material, or a combination of both. The sequence was created using 189 images taken by the spacecraft's NavCam 2 camera. NavCam 2 captured images for the spacecraft's Natural Feature Tracking navigation system. The NFT system allowed the spacecraft to autonomously guide itself to Bennu's surface by comparing real-time images with an onboard image catalog. During the sample collection event, the NavCam 2 camera continuously imaged Bennu's surface so that the NFT system could update the spacecraft's position and velocity relative to Bennu as it descended towards the targeted touchdown point. NavCam 2, a panchromatic imager, is one of three cameras comprising TAGCAMS, which is part of OSIRIS- REx's guidance, navigation, and control system. TAGCAMS was designed, built and tested by Malin Space Science Systems; Lockheed Martin Space integrated TAGCAMS to the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft and operates TAGCAMS.

Last month, the plucky little craft reached out and high-fived Bennu, a diamond-shaped asteroid roughly the size of a skyscraper, snatching a sample of its surface in the process. Orbiting the hunk of rock more than 200 million miles from Earth, the spacecraft extended its robotic arm and blasted the asteroid's surface with pure nitrogen gas. It then used a sample collection head to vacuum up the disturbed material. But OSIRIS-Rex's collection head may have worked too well. It snagged so much rocky material that it couldn't close its collection flap securely. Precious rocks leaked out into space, creating a dilemma about how the spacecraft should go about storing its cargo. \"This is the mission that keeps on surprising us,\" said Dante Lauretta, University of Arizona planetary scientist and principal investigator of the OSIRIS-REx mission during a news conference three days after the collection. \"We could not have performed a better collection experiment: It was successful, we collected 100s of grams of samples, but the biggest concern is that particles are escaping.\" Images and video beamed back from the spacecraft showed that its collection head contained a hefty stash of asteroid rubble, including some fairly larger pieces of rock. Lauretta said these bulkier pebbles were just large enough to prevent that flap from closing. This discovery forced the mission team to completely change its plans. Instead of taking the time to measure how much sample was collected, the team had to race to store the rocks before too much was lost to space-a meticulous process that took several days to complete. Scientists say the touch and go maneuver resulted not only in a successful sample collection but also provided new information about the layer of loose rocks that may cover the surfaces of many small planetary bodies, like asteroid Bennu. The material, previously thought to be akin to solid bedrock, is actually more like a playground ball pit. The team is anxious to get their hands on the sample, but won't know for sure exactly how much material they have until the craft returns to Earth in three years. But scientists are very confident that they grabbed more than the minimum mission requirement of 60 grams. Based on images beamed back, Lauretta and his team think they've grabbed at least 400 grams of material. Despite the uncertainty, OSIRIS-REx did something that no other NASA spacecraft has done: reach out and touch the surface of an asteroid. This daring maneuver has been decades in the making. NASA scientists started planning the mission in 2004. Four years ago, OSIRIS- REx launched on its journey to Bennu. OSIRIS-REx, which is short for Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security and Regolith Explorer, is designed to answer a number of fundamental questions including \"Where did we come from?\" Asteroids are scientific treasure troves because they contain pieces of the earliest materials that formed our solar system. Moons and planets change over time, but most asteroids do not, which makes them perfectly preserved galactic fossils. \"They can provide valuable information about how planets, like our own, came to be,\" said Lori Glaze, NASA's director of planetary science, in a news briefing. Earth has an atmosphere and active plate tectonics. As a result, its oldest rocks are typically weathered or are pushed deep into the mantle. So, researchers often use pieces of asteroids that land here-called meteorites-to learn more about the composition of the solar system and ancient Earth. Asteroids can contain carbon and other organic compounds, including the building blocks of life, not found on meteorites. To really understand how life on Earth started billions of years ago, scientists say we need to go somewhere where no life exists yet-like Bennu. OSIRIS-REx arrived at Bennu in 2018 and began its orbit, spending nearly two years extensively mapping the asteroid using a laser altimeter, a device that uses laser beams to measure the surface of planets and other rocky bodies. Based on preliminary data, Lauretta and his team expected to see a sandy surface, but were shocked to find Bennu was covered in boulders. This presented a challenge, as the team originally planned to land the craft on the asteroid and collect samples. Since Bennu is essentially a floating cosmic rubble pile, the team decided to forego a landing, and instead decided on an approach using that robotic arm. Regolith, the dirt and rubble found on an asteroid, is just like the dirt found on Earth, but in outer space, traditional means of scooping and digging it up won't work thanks to the lack of gravity. Engineers at Lockheed Martin in Colorado, where the spacecraft was built, needed to figure out how to collect the sample. Jim Harris, a Lockheed engineer, helped come up with the idea of vacuuming up regolith. Using a solo cup and an air compressor in his driveway, he tested out a very rudimentary prototype. Originally dubbed Muucav, a refined version of Harris' contraption was built and called the Touch And Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism, aka TAGSAM. The device consists of that robotic arm and a vacuum that looks like a giant, round showerhead. But instead of water shooting out, the head blasts Bennu's surface with gas, sucks up material and stores it. TAGSAM, which was loaded with three containers of gas, had three chances to collect a minimum of 60 grams of asteroid. The collection capsule far exceeded that on the first try, which the scientists deducted when they saw the collection head couldn't close. Originally, the team had planned to measure how much rock was in the sample head by commanding the spacecraft to spin around in place with its robotic arm extended. The more collected material, the more force it would take to speed up OSIRIS-REx's rotation, allowing researchers to estimate the amount of sample to within a few grams. Since the flap couldn't close, the team wanted to minimize the amount of sample lost to space, so they chose to skip the measurement step and focus on stowing the sample head as soon as possible. The team very carefully moved the sample head-open flap and all-to a storage container and gingerly placed it inside. Two locking mechanisms secured it. The arm then gently tugged on the head to make sure it was set. OSIRIS-REx will stay in orbit around Bennu until March, when it will depart the asteroid. The return trip to Earth will take approximately two-and-a-half years. At that point, the sample collection canister will separate from the spacecraft and parachute down, landing in the Utah desert in September 2023. It could be carrying the largest extraterrestrial sample since the Apollo era. Researchers around the world are already prepping their labs to study this material. One reason Bennu was selected as a target is because scientists believe it's a fragment of what was once a much larger space rock. As a body that broke off during a collision between two asteroids early in our solar system's history, the 4.5 billion-year-old rubble pile is a perfectly preserved cosmic time capsule. In a series of papers published in the journal Science on October 8, Lauretta and a team of researchers discovered that Bennu contained a cosmic prize: thick veins of organic minerals called carbonates, which form in hydrothermal systems. The collected samples could help scientists better understand the role asteroids played in bringing water and prebiotic material to Earth, providing the building blocks for life. Jamie Elsila, a research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, is especially interested in amino acids-which form proteins-that evolved within Bennu's dirt. Life on Earth uses 20 amino acids, but many more have been identified within meteorite samples that have fallen to the ground. Those samples could have been affected by their trip through the atmosphere. Bennu's samples are pristine, which means they could help scientists pinpoint which amino acids were present in the early solar system-and deduct how they may have influenced life on Earth. Studying bits of Bennu could also have broader implications for life throughout the universe. \"If this kind of chemistry is happening in the early solar system, it probably happened in other solar systems as well,\" Lauretta says. \"It could help us assess the likelihood of life throughout the galaxy and, ultimately, the universe.\" ", "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/nasa-snags-its-first-asteroid-sample-180976208/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx Final Flyby of Asteroid Bennu Before 2 Year Journey Back to Earth", "date": "2021-02-10", "content": "On April 7, NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission will give asteroid Bennu one last glance before saying farewell. Before departing for Earth on May 10, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will perform a final flyby of Bennu - capturing its last images of sample collection site Nightingale to look for transformations on Bennu's surface after the October 20, 2020, sample collection event. The OSIRIS-REx mission team recently completed a detailed safety analysis of a trajectory to observe sample site Nightingale from a distance of approximately 2.4 miles. The spacecraft's flight path is designed to keep OSIRIS-REx a safe distance from Bennu, while ensuring the science instruments can collect precise observations. The single flyby will mimic one of the observation sequences conducted during the mission's Detailed Survey phase in 2019. OSIRIS-REx will image Bennu for a full 4.3-hour rotation to obtain high-resolution images of the asteroid's northern and southern hemispheres and its equatorial region. The team will then compare these new images with the previous high-resolution imagery of Bennu obtained during 2019. This final flyby of Bennu was not part of the original mission schedule, but the observation run will provide the team an opportunity to learn how the spacecraft's contact with Bennu's surface altered the sample site. Bennu's surface was considerably disturbed after the Touch-and-Go sample collection event, with the collector head sinking 1.6 feet into the asteroid's surface while firing a pressurized charge of nitrogen gas. The spacecraft's thrusters also mobilized a substantial amount of surface material during the back-away burn. During this new mission phase, called the Post-TAG Observation phase, the spacecraft will perform five separate navigation maneuvers in order to return to the asteroid and position itself for the flyby. OSIRIS-REx executed the first maneuver on January 14, which acted as a braking burn and put the spacecraft on a trajectory to rendezvous with the asteroid one last time. Since October's sample collection event, the spacecraft has been slowly drifting away from the asteroid, and ended up approximately 1,635 miles from Bennu. After the braking burn, the spacecraft is now slowly approaching the asteroid and will perform a second approach maneuver on March 6, when it is approximately 155 miles from Bennu. OSIRIS-REx will then execute three subsequent maneuvers, which are required to place the spacecraft on a precise trajectory for the final flyby on April 7. OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to depart Bennu on May 10 and begin its two-year journey back to Earth.

On April 7, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will get one last close encounter with Bennu as it performs a final flyover to capture images of the asteroid's surface. While performing the flyover, the spacecraft will observe Bennu from a distance of about 2.3 miles - the closest it's been since the Touch-and-Go Sample Collection event on October 20, 2020. The OSIRIS-REx team decided to add this last flyover after Bennu's surface was significantly disturbed by the sample collection event. During touchdown, the spacecraft's sampling head sunk 1.6 feet into the asteroid's surface and simultaneously fired a pressurized charge of nitrogen gas. The spacecraft's thrusters also mobilized a substantial amount of surface material during the back-away burn. Because Bennu's gravity is so weak, these various forces from the spacecraft had a dramatic effect on the sample site - launching many of the region's rocks and a lot of dust in the process. This final flyby of Bennu will provide the mission team an opportunity to learn how the spacecraft's contact with Bennu's surface altered the sample site and the region surrounding it. The single flyby will mimic one of the observation sequences conducted during the mission's Detailed Survey phase in 2019. OSIRIS-REx will image Bennu for 5.9 hours, which is just over a full rotation period of the asteroid. Within this timeframe, the spacecraft's PolyCam imager will obtain high-resolution images of Bennu's northern and southern hemispheres and its equatorial region. The team will then compare these new images with the previous high-resolution imagery of the asteroid obtained during 2019. Most of the spacecraft's other science instruments will also collect data during the flyover, including the MapCam imager, the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer, the OSIRIS-REx Visible and Infrared Spectrometer, and the OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter. Exercising these instruments will give the team a chance to assess the current state of each science instrument onboard the spacecraft, as dust coated the instruments during the sample collection event. Understanding the health of the instruments is also part of NASA's evaluation of possible extended mission opportunities after the sample is delivered to Earth. After the Bennu flyby, it will take several days for the data from the flyover to be downlinked to Earth. Once the data are downlinked, the team will inspect the images to understand how OSIRIS-REx disturbed the asteroid's surface material. At this point, the team will also be able to evaluate the performance of the science instruments. The spacecraft will remain in asteroid Bennu's vicinity until May 10, when the mission will enter its Return Cruise phase and begin its two-year journey back to Earth. As it approaches Earth, the spacecraft will jettison the Sample Return Capsule that contains the rocks and dust collected from Bennu. The SRC will then travel through the Earth's atmosphere and land under parachutes at the Utah Test and Training Range on September 24, 2023. Once recovered, the capsule will be transported to the curation facility at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the sample will be removed for distribution to laboratories worldwide, enabling scientists to study the formation of our solar system and Earth as a habitable planet.

Their reward for a job well done has usually been abandonment. We build them, send them far into space, record the data they send back, and then, because there's usually no realistic way to recover them, we leave them to the abyss. NASA's OSIRIS-REx asteroid-sampling probe is one of the rare exceptions. On May 10, if everything works, it will start on its way home. No, NASA hasn't had a change of philosophy, and OSIRIS-REx itself will never land on Earth. But sealed inside a re-entry capsule on its instrument deck is a tiny sample of rock and dirt from the surface of the asteroid 101955 Bennu, and scientists are waiting for it. It is a precious cache: Bennu is believed to be made of carbon-rich debris from the early ages of the solar system. \"Bennu is a time capsule,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA. \"It's been out there for four and a half billion years waiting for us.\" OSIRIS-REx, launched in 2016, has been orbiting and mapping Bennu since 2018, and in October it descended to the asteroid's surface to grab some of its soil. Today, six months later, the ship is virtually on the opposite side of the sun from Earth-an optimal time for it to fire its main engines for a trip that should allow it to drop its sample capsule in the Utah desert, 80 km west of Salt Lake City, on September 24, 2023. That's in more than two years, even though Bennu's orbit is relatively close to Earth's. There are many reasons for taking it slow. Fuel must be conserved, the ship's cargo is priceless, and the laws of orbital mechanics are unforgiving. \"I would call it a moderate risk maneuver,\" says Peter Antreasian, the navigation team chief. \"It's high-consequence-mission failure if the maneuver doesn't go off. But we've been doing, oh, gosh, 120 maneuvers so far and we haven't had a problem yet.\" OSIRIS-REx has been a success so far-but Bennu, a ball of rubble less than 500 meters across, has thrown one surprise after another at mission managers. They never tried to land on the asteroid for the soil sampling; \"landing\" on a body whose gravity is only 8 one-millionths of Earth's would never work. Instead, the ship descended to one of the few relatively smooth spots it could find on the surface and jabbed it gently with a drum-shaped collection chamber at the end of a 3-meter arm. To their surprise, the probe seemed to break through the rock. They had hoped for at least 60 grams of soil (a sample that would easily fit in the palm of your hand), but realized the collector was so full that pieces of asteroid debris were escaping from it. They hurried to seal the collector in the return capsule for the ride home. They don't know what they have - they decided to skip a planned measurement - but one guess is that the capsule is carrying 300 grams. The return plan, says Antreasian, begins with a seven-minute engine burn that should increase the spacecraft velocity, relative to the sun, by about 950 kilometers per hour. Right now Bennu is 89 percent as far from the sun as Earth is, but to rendezvous with Earth, the spacecraft will have to follow an ellipse that takes it 40 percent farther out-almost as far from the sun as Mars is. Confirmation of the engine burn should come at about 4:16 p.m. EDT Monday, but if it doesn't happen, there are several more opportunities through June.", "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/nasa-osiris-rex-bennu-asteroid-sample-return-mission-from-deep-space"}, {"title": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx Celebrates Perfect Departure Maneuver from Asteroid Bennu", "date": "2021-06-03", "content": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is 328,000 miles, or 528,000 kilometers, away from the asteroid Bennu, having fired its engines on May 10 to initiate a return trip to Earth.

NASA announced that the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer, or OSIRIS-REx, spacecraft, on its way back to Earth after collecting samples from the asteroid Bennu, will travel to the asteroid Apophis after returning samples in September 2023. The main spacecraft, after ejecting the sample return container that will land in the Utah desert, will fly by Earth on a trajectory that will bring it to Apophis in 2029, shortly after that asteroid passes just 32,000 kilometers from the Earth. The spacecraft will spend 18 months in the vicinity of Apophis, studying the 350-meter asteroid and coming close enough to use its thrusters to brush away surface rocks and expose subsurface materials. Apophis has long been an asteroid of interest to planetary scientists because of its close approaches to Earth in 2029 and 2036 that, for a time after its discovery, raised concerns about an impact. While scientists have ruled out an impact, the close approach offered the prospect of spacecraft missions to study the asteroid, something the OSIRIS-REx mission team had been discussing since 2020. \"Apophis is one of the most infamous asteroids,\" said Dani DellaGiustina, deputy principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx, in a statement. She will become principal investigator of the extended mission, called OSIRIS-APEX for \"Apophis Explorer,\" after the Bennu samples are returned to Earth. \"We were stoked to find out the mission was extended.\" Scientists will use the extended mission to study the composition of the asteroid as well as determine if the asteroid's structure was affected by the close Earth flyby. The project estimates the extended mission will cost $200 million over nine years. \"The investigation is not without substantial technical risk,\" Lori Glaze, director of NASA's planetary science division, wrote in an April 25 memo approving the extension. The trajectory OSIRIS-APEX will take will bring it within half an astronomical unit of the sun, much closer than originally designed when the spacecraft traveled to Bennu, requiring what she called \"significant engineering work\" to ensue spacecraft systems can survive several such close approaches before arriving at Apophis. OSIRIS-REx was one of eight planetary science missions that won extensions after a \"senior review\" of spacecraft that had already completed their primary missions. NASA extended the other seven missions - Curiosity, InSight, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN and New Horizons - by three years each. NASA extended the InSight Mars lander despite expectations that declining output from its solar arrays will cause the mission to end later this year, before the extended mission can begin. A report from the panel that conducted the senior review noted the project gives the spacecraft only a 5% chance of surviving through the end of this year, with the expectation that, by December, power levels drop to a level called \"dead bus recovery\" mode that render the spacecraft inoperable. The extended mission, though, would allow the possibility for some spacecraft operations if the spacecraft can revive itself in the next Martian summer in mid-2023. \"If the spacecraft can 'resurrect' itself from DBR after depth of winter,\" the report stated, \"system operability would need to be determined at the time\" to see if an extended mission was feasible. NASA is also closely monitoring fuel levels on Mars Odyssey, a spacecraft operating at more for more than two decades. The overall spacecraft is \"remarkably healthy,\" the senior review report stated, but uncertainty about how much fuel is left on the spacecraft raises questions about how long it can continue to operate to both conduct science and serve as a communications relay for other Mars missions. Other than OSIRIS-REx, NASA did not disclose the cost of extended missions. NASA's fiscal year 2023 budget proposal projected spending between $7.8 million, on InSight, and $45 million, on the Curiosity Mars rover that year. Glaze wrote in her memo that for New Horizons, projected to spend $12.5 million in 2023, she would look to share costs with the agency's astrophysics and heliophysics divisions because of the science that distant spacecraft would perform in its extended mission.

That risk was retired after subsequent observations, but it will be the closest an asteroid of this size has gotten in the 50 or so years... It gets within one-tenth the distance between the Earth and moon during the 2029 encounter. People in Europe and Africa will be able to see it with the naked eye, that's how close it will get. We were stoked to find out the mission was extended.\" The university stated that OSIRIS-APEX will not collect a sample on this next mission, but when it reaches Apophis, it will study the asteroid for 18 months and collect data along the way. It also will make a maneuver similar to the one it made during sample collection at Bennu, by approaching the surface and firing its thrusters. This event will expose the asteroid's subsurface, to allow mission scientists to learn more about the asteroid's material properties. \"OSIRIS-APEX is a manifestation of a core objective of our mission to enable the next generation of leadership in space exploration,\" Lauretta said.
