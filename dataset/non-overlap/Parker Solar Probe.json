Solar Probe Plus will begin advanced design, development and testing - a step NASA designates as Phase C - following a successful design review in which an independent assessment board deemed that the mission team, led by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Md., was ready to move ahead with full-scale spacecraft fabrication, assembly, integration and testing. \"Solar Probe Plus will fly closer to the sun than any spacecraft before it - almost 10 times closer to the sun than the planet Mercury - and this presents unprecedented technical challenges,\" says Andrew Driesman, Solar Probe Plus project manager at APL. \"Whether it was devising ways for a spacecraft to survive so close to the sun, or to collect data in such an extreme environment, the concept of an operational solar probe had challenged engineers and scientists for decades, and now we're another step closer to making it happen.\" Set to launch in 2018, Solar Probe Plus will orbit the sun 24 times, closing in with the help of seven Venus flybys. At its closest passes the probe will speed 118 miles per second through the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, coming about 3.8 million miles (about 6.2 million kilometers) from the surface to explore a region - and face hazards - no other spacecraft has encountered. Solar Probe Plus will carry 10 science instruments specifically designed to help solve two key puzzles of solar physics: why the sun's outer atmosphere is so much hotter than the sun's visible surface, and what accelerates the solar wind that affects Earth and our solar system. \"The answers to these questions can be obtained only through in-situ measurements of the solar wind down in the corona,\" says APL's Nicky Fox, Solar Probe Plus project scientist. \"Solar Probe Plus gets close enough to provide the missing links, with the right complement of instruments to make the measurements. For the first time, we will be able to go up and touch our star.\" APL, which manages the mission and leads the spacecraft fabrication and integration effort, has made significant progress on several enabling technologies, such as the carbon-carbon composite heat shield that will protect Solar Probe Plus from temperatures exceeding 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit and impacts from hypervelocity dust particles. Engineers have also built and tested a liquid-cooling system to keep the spacecraft's solar arrays at safe operating temperature throughout the voyage, and spacecraft parts are undergoing high-velocity dust tests that simulate flights through swarms of high-energy particles near the sun. \"Solar Probe Plus is a pathfinder for voyages to other stars and will explore one of the last unexplored regions of the solar system, the solar corona, where space weather is born,\" says Lika Guhathakurta, Solar Probe Plus program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. The Solar Probe Plus team includes engineers, scientists, technicians and other experts from government, academia and industry. The mission is part of NASA's Living With a Star program, designed to learn more about the sun and its effects on planetary systems and human activities.

The obvious players right now are Delta 4 Heavy and Falcon Heavy.\" \"The decision to allow the consideration of a Heavy-class vehicle for Solar Probe Plus was made by the Science Mission Directorate in the spring of 2014 based on input from the Project and advice from Launch Services,\" James Norman, NASA's director of launch services, said July 25 via email. He declined to comment on why NASA cleared the program to procure a bigger launch vehicle, saying \"the specifics associated with the decision are procurement sensitive and competition sensitive data.\" Trading up to a Delta 4 Heavy or Falcon Heavy means the money paid to ATK Missile Products of Beltsville, Maryland, for work on the customized kick-stage motor, known as STAR 48GXV, was a wasted effort for Solar Probe Plus. APL spokesman Michael Buckley said July 23 that ATK was paid $15.7 million for the work, which culminated with a December test firing of the solid-fueled STAR motor. The flight-proven Delta 4 Heavy is Denver-based ULA's most powerful launcher, typically used for the largest classified national security satellites. Falcon Heavy, which is still in development at SpaceX, features a first stage composed of three nine-engine Falcon 9 core stages. Falcon Heavy's first launch is planned for 2015. SpaceX advertises the rocket as the most powerful launcher since the Saturn 5, able to lift 53 metric tons to low Earth orbit at one-third the cost of a Delta 4 Heavy. The Delta 4 Heavy, which has flown seven times including its 2004 debut, is capable of lifting roughly 26,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. NASA is paying $375 million for the Delta 4 Heavy it ordered in 2011 for this December's unmanned test launch of the Orion crew capsule. Although Falcon Heavy has yet to fly, NASA's Launch Services Program left the door open for SpaceX to compete for the Solar Probe Plus launch contract in a draft request for proposals released July 10. While NASA will consider only rockets certified to loft Category 3 payloads - the internal designation reserved for the most important and risk-averse missions - agency rules allow for Category 3 certification with as few as three launches, NASA spokesman Joshua Buck wrote in a July 24 email. SpaceX has three Falcon Heavy launches on its manifest between now and 2017: an inaugural demonstration launch in 2015; a shared launch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Deep Space Climate Observatory and the U.S. Air Force's Space Test Program-2 experimental spacecraft, also in 2015; and a 2017 launch of a commercial communications satellite for Intelsat of Washington and Luxembourg. SpaceX spokesman John Taylor declined to comment on whether SpaceX would seek certification to launch Solar Probe Plus. The ATK-built stage that was scrapped along with plans to use ULA's most-powerful Atlas 5 - the so-called 551 variant that features five solid-rocket boosters and a 5.4-meter payload fairing - was based on a similar solid-fuel upper stage ATK made for the Atlas 5 that launched the roughly 480-kilogram New Horizons probe toward Pluto in 2006. APL thought Solar Probe Plus could use a similar setup, but the amount of energy required to launch from Earth toward the sun, coupled with Solar Probe Plus' heftier 658-kilogram launch mass, was more than the New Horizons launch rig could handle, Ryschkewitsch said July 22. NASA's Science Mission Directorate approved Solar Probe Plus to proceed into development in March. The orbiter is bound for a nearly seven-year primary mission \"to the fires of hell,\" Nicky Fox, APL-based Solar Probe Plus project scientist, told SpaceNews here after a Maryland Space Business Roundtable Luncheon attended by employees of APL, NASA Goddard and many local NASA contractors. At its closest, Solar Probe Plus and its 10 instruments will fly about 6 million kilometers from the sun's surface. The mission will measure blasts of charged particles, or solar winds, emanating from the star's corona. Solar winds can disrupt sensitive electronic equipment in space and on Earth's surface. Sending a dedicated probe to the sun was identified as the top priority in a 10-year heliophysics roadmap, \"The Sun to the Earth - and Beyond,\" published in 2003 by the National Research Council.

Under a nearly $3 million contract, Northrop Grumman will provide its Scalable Space Inertial Reference Unit (Scalable SIRU) for the Solar Probe Plus mission, which APL manages for NASA. By supplying critical rotation rate data that enable the stabilization, pointing and attitude control of satellites and space vehicles, the Scalable SIRU will play a vital role in the Solar Probe Plus spacecraft's unprecedented mission to fly through and examine the sun's atmosphere. The Scalable SIRU delivery is expected in May 2016. Expected to launch in 2018, Solar Probe Plus will explore the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, for the first time. The spacecraft will employ a combination of in-situ measurements and imaging to understand why the sun's outer atmosphere is much hotter than the sun's visible surface, and what accelerates the solar wind that affects Earth and our solar system. \"Our Scalable SIRU was competitively selected for the Solar Probe Plus mission because of its unparalleled performance, accuracy and reliability,\" said Bob Mehltretter, vice president, Navigation and Positioning Systems, Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems. \"The system is equipped with redundant components that meet the strict, high performance requirements of the anticipated seven-year mission.\" The Scalable SIRU is the industry standard for high-precision, long-life attitude control solutions supporting commercial, government and civil space missions.

As expected, NASA announced its selection of the United Launch Alliance Delta 4-Heavy rocket to dispatch the Solar Probe Plus mission from Earth. Liftoff from Cape Canaveral is set for July 31, 2018, at the opening of a 20-day launch window, NASA said in a press release. The launch contract's value is $389.1 million, according to NASA. \"The ULA team is very proud that NASA has selected the Delta 4-Heavy launch vehicle for this extraordinary science mission,\" said Jim Sponnick, ULA vice president for Atlas and Delta programs, in a ULA press release. \"The Delta 4-Heavy rocket is uniquely qualified to provide the launch service for this vital science mission that will help us understand processes near the surface of the sun that affect space weather and radiation environments. We look forward to successfully delivering this critical spacecraft to orbit for NASA.\" A Star 48 solid-fueled third stage supplied by Orbital ATK will help propel Solar Probe Plus away from Earth. \"ULA has considerable successful experience integrating third stages on top of our already capable vehicles,\" Sponnick said in a statement. \"We did something very similar when we launched the New Horizons mission, which will fly by Pluto and its moons later this year. We are proud to have Orbital ATK as our teammate for the development of the third stage for the SPP mission.\" NASA initially planned to launch the Solar Probe Plus mission aboard an Atlas 5 rocket. But not even the Atlas 5's most powerful configuration - with five solid rocket boosters - could do the job, NASA officials said last year. That left the Delta 4-Heavy rocket as the only active U.S. launcher capable of sending Solar Probe Plus toward the sun. NASA kept open the possibility of using SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket for the launch. But the Falcon Heavy is still in development with a first test launch planned later this year. At least three Falcon Heavy launches are required before the new heavy-lifter achieves certification to blast NASA's most costly missions into space. SpaceX did not confirm whether it bid on the Solar Probe Plus launch, but ULA said in a press release that NASA's selection of the Delta 4-Heavy \"resulted from a competitive procurement that considered multiple launch providers.\" Even after launching on the Delta 4-Heavy rocket - and getting a push from the Star 48 third stage motor - the 1,350-pound Solar Probe Plus spacecraft will still need help to reach the mission's final operating post, culminating with three close-up passes within 3.8 million miles of the sun. Solar Probe Plus will orbit the sun 24 times in its seven-year mission. Seven flybys of Venus are planned from 2018 through 2024 to reshape the spacecraft's orbit through the inner solar system, moving Solar Probe Plus to its closest point to the sun in December 2024. Solar Probe Plus will fly 10 times closer to the sun than the planet Mercury, whizzing above the sun at speeds of 125 miles per second. A 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite heat shield will protect the probe's sensitive instrumentation and electronics from temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Funded by NASA and led by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, the mission aims to find the source of the sun's solar wind, a supersonic outflow of plasma that permeates throughout the solar system. Solar Probe Plus will also study what makes the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere, much hotter than the star's surface. \"The answers to these questions can be obtained only through in-situ measurements of the solar wind down in the corona,\" said Nicky Fox, Solar Probe Plus project scientist at APL. \"Solar Probe Plus gets close enough to provide the missing links, with the right complement of instruments to make the measurements. For the first time, we will be able to go up and touch our star.\" NASA has budgeted about $1.5 billion to build and launch the Solar Probe Plus mission. The Solar Probe Plus launch contract gives ULA a backlog of 14 Delta 4 missions through 2020. Five of those launches are with the Delta 4-Heavy, which is made by bolting three Delta 4 rocket boosters together. The three first stage cores are powered by hydrogen-burning RS-68 engines, and a second stage RL10 engine will complete the Delta 4's launch sequence, giving way to the solid-fueled Star 48 upper stage motor. ULA chief executive Tory Bruno has announced the company plans to retire the Delta 4 rocket by the end of the decade. The Delta 4-Heavy version would keep flying until SpaceX's Falcon Heavy or ULA's planned next-generation rocket are ready to take over launching the U.S. government's heaviest spy satellites.

The closest three will be just 3.8 million miles from the surface of the star. Scientists have long wanted to send a probe through the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, to better understand the solar wind and the material it carries into our solar system. The primary science goals for the Solar Probe Plus mission are to trace the flow of energy and understand the heating of the solar corona and to explore the physical mechanisms that accelerate the solar wind and energetic particles. To meet those objectives, Solar Probe Plus will carry four instrument suites into the Sun's corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star. These instruments will study magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles, and will image the solar wind. The instruments are: the Fields Experiment from the University of California Space Sciences Laboratory, Berkeley, California; the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISIS) from the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio; the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons Investigation (SWEAP) from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, Massachusetts; and the Wide Field Imager for Solar Probe Plus (WISPR) from the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C.

The goal of the mission is to study is to study the processes that heat the Sun's corona (its outer atmosphere) and create the solar wind, the strings of charged particles that the Sun hurls out into space, as well as the particles that are carried along with it. Scientists have long wanted this kind of close-up view of the solar winds. Though they are invisible to the naked eye, the solar winds affect the entire solar system. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, or APL, in Laurel, Maryland has designed the Solar Probe Plus. They will also build and operate it for NASA. The mission recently passed a crucial milestone. It successfully completed its Critical Design Review, or CDR. During this process, NASA certified that the Solar Probe Plus mission design has reached the advanced stage and gave APL the green light to begin building, testing, and assembling all of the mission's elements. Essentially the project is moving from the drawing board to the factory floor. The Solar Probe Plus is scheduled to launch from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida atop a Delta 4-Heavy rocket. Over the course of six years, the probe will make 24 elliptical orbits of the Sun. Each orbit will bring it closer to the Sun. To keep from being pulled in to the Sun's immense gravity well, the Solar Probe Plus will have to be going very fast. Using seven gravity assist flybys of Venus, the probe will eventually accelerate to 125 miles per second or 0.067% the speed of light. As its speed increases Solar Probe Plus' distance from the Sun will decrease. The closest three orbits will bring the craft within a mere 3.8 million miles from the surface of the Sun. This may not seem all that close, but keep in mind that this will actually bring the Solar Probe Plus into the Sun's corona, its outer atmosphere, where it will face temperatures of 2500 degrees Fahrenheit. Solar Probe Plus will carry four sets of instruments that will allow it to study magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles, and will image the solar wind. The craft and its instruments will need protection from the Sun's searing heat and radiation. To this end, it will be protected by a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite shield.

According to Forbes's Bruce Dorminey, who spoke with Ralph McNutt of Johns Hopkins University, one of the probe's team leads, creating a spacecraft that can survive contact with the sun requires considerable scientific mastery: At its very closest approach of only 3.8 million miles from the Sun's surface, SPP will be subjected to up to 475 times the solar irradiance experienced at Earth. Thus, the science collection phases of the mission during close encounters are designed to be autonomous. That is, without real-time direction from ground-controllers. Data taken during these collection phases will be saved on solid state recorders for subsequent downlink via a high gain antenna pointed back to Earth.

The lab brought in the Southern Research team to conduct high-temperature evaluations of the heat shield materials - a task the Birmingham non-profit organization has been performing since the early days of NASA. Making sure the Solar Probe Plus can handle the hazards of intense heat and radiation is crucial. Scientists have imagined a mission to the Sun since 1958, and data collected by this probe will yield important new insights about the sun's atmosphere - known as the corona - and its role in producing fierce solar winds. Scientists want a deeper understanding of solar activity so they are better able to predict space-weather events that can impact life on Earth and disrupt the operations of orbiting satellites. \"The talented engineers and technicians at Southern Research have made many important contributions to the nation's space program over several decades,\" said Michael D. Jones, vice president of Engineering. \"Solar Probe Plus is an exciting mission, and we are proud to have been part of an endeavor that will advance scientific knowledge about the Sun.\" The Solar Probe Plus will travel closer to the Sun than any previous spacecraft, approaching as close as 3.9 million miles as it hurtles past the star at 450,000 miles per hour. That will put the craft well within the orbit of Mercury, the planet nearest to the sun. Over seven years, the probe will complete two dozen solar orbits, using seven gravity-assisted flybys of Venus to skirt continually closer to the Sun's blazing corona. So it can perform this revolutionary investigation, the spacecraft and its instruments will be protected from the heat by a 4.5-inch-thick carbon composite shield capable of withstanding temperatures climbing to more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"As you can imagine, the heat shield is a big article,\" Cuneo said. \"It's made up of carbon-carbon sheets on the top and the bottom, and in the middle, there's a rigid carbon foam.\" The Southern Research engineering team was asked to determine the mechanical and thermal properties of the heat shield materials. The carbon composite used in the sheets represented familiar ground for testing, thanks to Southern Research's longstanding involvement in the space program. The carbon foam, however, was different. Just figuring out how to the test the relatively brittle open-cell foam was technically challenging, Cuneo said. The issue: How can you measure strain when you can't even touch the specimen? \"When you pressed on the foam, it would create dust. It wouldn't actually break, it just kind of machined itself down,\" Cuneo said. \"Anything that generated compression was a real issue with the foam, so we developed a way to stiffen the ends by impregnating them. \"We were able to figure out how to grab and pull or torque a specimen, and develop ways to measure strain because you couldn't mount anything on the specimens,\" he added. The Southern Research engineers generated a database of the carbon foam properties, and the material passed muster. \"The foam fit what they thought it was going to do - particularly at high temperatures, which is what they were concerned about - and it's on track for launch,\" Cuneo said. In July 2016, NASA said the Solar Probe Plus is slated to launch during a 20-day window that opens on July 31, 2018. The spacecraft has passed NASA's design review stage, meaning it is has moved to final assembly. Engineers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory are now finishing assembly and installing spacecraft systems and science instruments.

Despite that, NASA and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) partnered to study the Sun's atmosphere and its solar winds with the help of a Draper Technology. Solar winds are the energy emitted by the sun. It is so powerful that it has the capability to affect the planet's power grids, aircraft and even satellites. Solar winds could be damaging due to the radiation it contains. Everyone is vulnerable to solar winds and radiation including astronauts, spacecraft and even celestial bodies. This is the reason why the study of solar winds is vital. The study aims to understand why the sun emits such damaging energetic charge to help people on earth accurately predict and swiftly prepare for an upcoming surge. SAO and Draper are developing new \"sophisticated\" sensors for NASA's Solar Probe Plus spacecraft scheduled for launch in 2018. The technology is expected to enhance man's capacity to understand solar winds and the sun's atmosphere in general. John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory is responsible for developing NASA's Solar Probe Spacecraft. It is expected to withstand a temperature of more than 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It will travel for seven years at 37.6 million and will approach the sun 4 million miles from the surface -- a distance that no man-made vehicle has ever done before. The close approach will allow the Solar Probe Plus to collect data that will help provide information about the mechanisms that heat the corona and accelerate solar winds. The two vital processes are responsible for the solar winds that affect the Earth and other bodies in the solar system. SAO will carry a Faraday cup supported by Draper and operated by the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The Faraday cup is capable of measuring supersonic solar particles and radiation. \"Such a mission would require a spacecraft and instrumentation capable of withstanding extremes of radiation, high-velocity travel and the harsh solar condition and that is the kind of program deeply familiar to Draper and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,\" Seamus Tuohy, Director of the Space Systems Program Office at Draper said.", "url": "https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/37008/20170403/smithsonian-draper-developing-new-sensor-for-nasas-solar-probe-plus-mission-to-the-sun.htm"}, {"title": "NASA names Solar Probe Plus mission after space scientist", "date": "2017-06-01", "content": "NASA's Solar Probe Plus mission, scheduled for launch next year to travel closer to the sun than any previous spacecraft, has a new name honoring a scientist who predicted the existence of the solar wind. In a ceremony at the University of Chicago May 31, NASA announced that the spacecraft will now be called the Parker Solar Probe after Eugene Parker, a professor emeritus in the university's astronomy and astrophysics department. The name represents a twist on an agency tradition. \"NASA has named about 20 spacecraft after distinguished researchers,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, at the ceremony. That includes major space telescopes like Hubble, Chandra and Spitzer, as well as smaller missions like Fermi. \"However, NASA has never named a spacecraft after a researcher during their lifetime,\" he added. The Parker Space Probe will be the first such mission. Parker, as a young scientist at the university in 1958, predicted that the sun emitted a stream of high-velocity particles, now known as the solar wind. \"This was really a transformative idea at the time,\" said Eric Isaacs, executive vice president for research, innovation and national laboratories at the university. Parker, in fact, struggled to get a paper about the solar wind published because many other scientists were skeptical about his findings. Within a few years, however, spacecraft missions confirmed the existence of the solar wind, as well as the shape of the sun's magnetic field that he also predicted. \"It made this a huge home run and really one of the biggest discoveries, I think, in solar or space physics,\" Zurbuchen said. Many aspects of solar activity, though, remain a mystery, including the mechanism that heats the sun's corona to temperatures of millions of degrees. Helping unravel those mysteries will be the primary mission of the Parker Solar Probe. Work on the spacecraft remains on track, project scientist Nicola Fox said at the event. The spacecraft, being built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, will move to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center late this year for environmental testing. The spacecraft is scheduled for launch during a 20-day window that opens at the end of July 2018. A Delta 4 Heavy, equipped with an additional third stage, will launch the spacecraft, and seven Venus flybys over seven years will put the spacecraft into an orbit that brings it to within six million kilometers of the sun's photosphere on its closest approach. On those close approaches, the spacecraft will be protected by a heat shield made of carbon composite material more than 11 centimeters thick. The heat shield will keep the spacecraft at roughly room temperature while the shield is exposed to conditions approaching 1,400 degrees Celsius. Parker, who turns 90 on June 10, also received NASA's Distinguished Public Service Medal at the ceremony. \"I'm certainly greatly honored to be associated with such a heroic scientific space mission,\" he said.

The probe, which will be the first to \"touch the Sun\" is being readied for an anticipated 31 July 2018 launch aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL - which will start a 7 year mission to study the Sun. Parker Solar Probe: Now less than one year away from launch, the Parker Solar Probe began as an idea in the Outer Planet/Solar Probe program of NASA in the 1990s. The original mission concept, the Solar Orbiter, was canceled in 2003 as part of the George W. Bush Administration's restructuring of NASA to focus more on research and development and address management shortcomings in the wake of the 1 February 2003 breakup of the Space Shuttle Columbia that claimed the lives of all seven astronauts aboard. Six years later, the mission concept was resurrected as a \"new mission start\" in 2009 with an aim to launch a new solar probe in 2015. By 2012, as the mission moved into its design phase, the launch was pushed to 2018. Originally called the Solar Probe Plus, the mission was renamed earlier this year on 31 May 2017, and in so doing NASA radically departed from of its previous mission naming practices. All prior missions named for people were done so after their deaths in honor of their accomplishments and contributions to science. Breaking with this tradition, NASA renamed the Solar Probe Plus the Parker Solar Probe after Eugene Parker - making Parker the first living person to have a NASA spacecraft named after him. A pioneering astrophysicist, Eugene Parker is best known for developing the theory of supersonic solar wind and correctly predicting the shape of the Heliospheric current sheet (or Parker spiral shape) of the solar magnetic field in the outer solar system. Furthermore, in 1987, Eugene Parker proposed that the solar corona was heated by a myriad of tiny nanoflares - solar flare-like brightenings that occur across the entirety of the Sun's surface. Unlike other solar telescopes and missions, the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) will venture where no probe has gone before - into the Sun's corona. Mission planning calls for the probe to approach the Sun to within 6 million km (3.7 million miles) or just 0.04 AU - 8.5 solar radii - of the corona. The mission will make three passes of the Sun at this distance between December 2024 and June 2025 after a prolonged period of orbit reduction maneuvers. PSP will launch atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket - all components of which are in final processing at the Horizontal Integration Facility at SLC-37 - in a launch window extending from 31 July to 19 August 2018. Assuming a 31 July launch, the probe will make the first of its seven (7) flybys of Venus on 28 September 2018. The approach to Venus is calculated to place the PSP into an elliptical, 150 day orbit of the Sun. The second Venus flyby on 21 December 2019 will further shorten PSP's orbital period to 130 days. Over the course of the next five years, an additional five flybys of Venus will occur - the last of which will place PSP into an 6 million km x 109.3 million km (3.7 million mile x 67.9 million mile) orbit with a period of just 88-89 days (roughly the same orbital period of Mercury). That seventh and final Venus flyby will occur on 2 November 2024 - leading to the first close-approach perihelion of PSP of just 3.7 million miles the Sun's \"surface\" and well into the upper corona on 19 December 2024. A second close perihelion will occur on 18 March 2025 followed by the third and final scheduled dip into the corona on 14 June 2025. Special heat shield and cooling system: Diving that close to the Sun, PSP will, according to NASA, \"explore what is arguably the last and most important region of the solar system to be visited by a spacecraft and will finally answer top-priority science goals of the last five decades.\" Overall, the mission objectives including: Determining the structure and dynamics of the magnetic fields at the sources of solar wind, tracing the flow of energy that heats the corona and accelerates the solar wind, determining what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles, and exploring dusty plasma near the Sun and its influence on solar wind and energetic particle formation. In order to survive the intense environment of the outer corona, an area in which the probe will experience solar intensity 520 times greater than Earth does, a specialized heat shield and cooling system were designed to protect the spacecraft and scientific instruments. The heat shield (or solar shadow-shield), which was installed for integrated vehicle testing last week at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL), is made of reinforced carbon-carbon composite. Reinforced carbon-carbon is most widely and infamously known for its use on the Space Shuttle, as the nose cap and Wing Leading Edge elements of the Thermal Protection System on the five Orbiters - though it was initially developed for the nose cones of intercontinental ballistic missiles and is currently used in the brake systems for Formula One racing cars. For the PSP, reinforced carbon-carbon will serve as the solar shadow-shield, which will block direct radiation from the Sun for the probe's instrumentation and experiment packages. After integrated testing with the solar shadow-shield is complete, the structure will be removed and will not be reinstalled until shortly before spacecraft encapsulation for launch next year. Moreover, the mission's proximity to the Sun also necessitated the development and use of a revolutionary cooling system to ensure the probe's solar arrays continue to operate at peak efficiency in the extremely hostile conditions of the corona. The arrays are designed with an upward bend at their outer edges. These edges will stick out beyond the solar shadow-shield during coronal passes to provide the PSP with enough power for the spacecraft's systems. \"Our solar arrays are going to operate in an extreme environment that other missions have never operated in before,\" said Mary Kae Lockwood, spacecraft system engineer for Parker Solar Probe at APL. While the surface of the solar shadow-shield will reach temperatures in excess of 2,500\u00b0 F, the specially designed cooling system for the solar arrays will keep the arrays at a temperature of just 320\u00b0 F or below. This will be the first-of-its-kind actively cooled solar array system and was developed by the APL in partnership with United Technologies Aerospace Systems (which manufactured the cooling system) and SolAero Technologies (which produced the solar arrays). The cooling system itself is composed of a heated accumulator tank that will hold water (the coolant) during launch, two-speed pumps, and four radiators made of titanium tubes and aluminum fins just two hundredths of an inch thick. Water was chosen as the coolant because of the temperature range the system will encounter throughout the mission. \"For the temperature range we required, and for the mass constraints, water was the solution,\" said Lockwood. During and immediately after launch, the solar arrays and cooling system radiators will undergo wide temperature swings from 60\u00b0 F (15\u00b0 C) inside the payload fairing to -85\u00b0 F to -220\u00b0 F (-65\u00b0 C to -140\u00b0 C) once exposed to space before they can be warmed by the Sun. A pre-heated coolant tank will keep the coolant water from freezing. \"One of the biggest challenges in testing this is those transitions from very cold to very hot in a short period of time,\" Lockwood said. \"But those tests, and other tests to show how the system works when under a fully-heated TPS, correlated quite well to our models.\" Testing and modeling showed the team that they needed to increase the thermal blanketing on the first two radiators that will be activated after launch in order to balance maximizing their capacity at the end of the mission with further reducing the risk of water freezing early in the mission. Of the numerous scientific results expected from the mission, one very important one for life on Earth and out technological dependence will be the increased ability to forecast major space-weather events - like Coronal Mass Ejections (significant releases of plasma and magnetic fields from the corona) and solar flares (the ejection of clouds of electrons, ions, atoms along with the electromagnetic waves through the corona).

The same way you would move anything else: carefully wrap it, pack it, rent a truck, and perform a nitrogen purge. Last month, the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft traveled from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where it was designed and built, to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. It's a short drive, but it took significant preparation. First, the spacecraft was wrapped in a special protective layer to prevent dust or dirt from reaching the probe. Then it was bolted to a specially designed pedestal that carefully tilted the probe onto its side to fit it inside a shipping container. If kept upright, the probe would have been too tall to pass under highway bridges during transport. Once boxed and loaded onto a truck bed, the scientists performed a nitrogen purge, slowly sucking air and moisture out of the container and replacing it with ultra-dry nitrogen with an extremely low dew point. A nitrogen purge is a common practice among military and commercial aerospace projects to prevent corrosive moisture and condensation from reaching sensitive electronics. The move, accompanied by a state police escort, took place at 4 a.m.-to avoid traffic, of course. At Goddard, the Parker Solar Probe has undergone extensive testing and simulations to ensure it's ready for its historic mission next year. It underwent an acoustic test, which subjected the probe to sound forces like those generated during a rocket launch. Goddard's Acoustic Test Chamber is a 42-foot-tall chamber that uses 6-foot-tall speakers that can reach 150 decibels to simulate the extreme noise of the Delta IV Heavy, the highest- capacity rocket currently in operation and the vehicle that will carry the probe into space. The spacecraft's specially designed Thermal Protection System, or TPS, has also gone through thorough testing. The heat shield, developed by scientists at APL and the Whiting School of Engineering, is made of carbon-carbon composite material to protect the probe from the intense heat of the sun's atmosphere, which can reach temperatures of almost 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. As the spacecraft hurtles through the hot solar atmosphere and back out into outer space, the TPS will keep the instruments on the spacecraft at approximately room temperature. The heat shield was tested in Goddard's Thermal Vacuum Chamber, which simulated the harsh conditions that it will endure during the mission. During its mission, the Parker Solar Probe will use seven Venus flybys over the course of nearly seven years to gradually shrink its orbit around the sun, coming as close as 3.7 million miles-about eight times closer to the sun than any spacecraft has come before. Upon its closest orbit, the Parker Solar Probe will be traveling at about 450,000 miles per hour. That's fast enough to get from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C., in one second. The solar probe, named for Eugene Parker, the astrophysicist who predicted the existence of the solar wind in 1958, is a \"true mission of exploration,\" the scientists write on the mission homepage. \"Still, as with any great mission of discovery, Parker Solar Probe is likely to generate more questions than it answers.\" ", "url": "https://hub.jhu.edu/2017/12/20/parker-solar-probe-relocates-to-goddard-space-center/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA studying sensor issue with Parker Solar Probe", "date": "2018-04-09", "content": "As a NASA spacecraft designed to fly closer to the sun than ever before arrived in Florida for launch, project officials are still studying problems with sensors on the spacecraft. NASA shipped the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft from the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland to Florida in the early morning hours of April 3. The spacecraft is now at an Astrotech Space Operations processing facility in Titusville, Florida, near the Kennedy Space Center. In that facility, the spacecraft will undergo additional work, including the installation of a heat shield that will protect the spacecraft from the intense heat of the sun. The spacecraft is scheduled for launch on a United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy during a launch window that opens July 31 and runs through August 19. As those preparations continue, officials are studying problems with devices known as platinum resistance thermometers that are part of the spacecraft's thermal control system. Those devices have suffered a higher-than-expected failure rate, according to a presentation at an April 5 meeting of NASA's Heliophysics Advisory Committee. The thermometers are lightweight, highly sensitive temperature sensors used to help provide feedback to the spacecraft's cooling system and solar arrays, NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown said April 9. \"We put all spacecraft through a rigorous test program to make sure all systems are working as designed and it is normal for a test program to uncover issues.\" \"The team is looking very carefully at whether any change is needed,\" Peg Luce, acting director of NASA's heliophysics division, said at the meeting. The issue, she said, was debated \"quite significantly\" at a review last week to approve the shipment of the spacecraft to Florida, including whether to delay that shipment to study the problem. \"There are certain, possible fixes if we need to fix something that could be done at the Cape, so the decision was to go ahead and ship,\" she said. Brown confirmed that the review committee, \"after assessing the situation, unanimously approved the shipment of the spacecraft to Florida for launch processing.\" That decision, though, doesn't mean that Parker Solar Probe is cleared for launch. \"We are not going to fly this mission if we have concerns about it,\" Luce said. \"If we have to take more time, we will.\" Luce said the mission has been working some other technical issues, although none are seen as affecting launch plans. Guidance and control testing was running behind schedule, but she said the mission now has that \"completely under control.\" She added there are \"late breaking\" but unidentified issues with the solid-fuel Star 48 upper stage motor that will provide the additional boost needed to send the spacecraft on its trajectory towards the sun. \"It all looks like that will be smoothed out in time for launch,\" she said. The mission, she said, had resolved issues with one instrument, called the Solar Probe Cup and part of a package called Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons. That instrument is mounted on the edge of the spacecraft's heat shield and is directly exposed to the sun during the spacecraft's close approaches. \"It was a real difficult design and they've gone to great lengths to ensure that there's no concern about failures that could affect the rest of the spacecraft,\" she said. Testing has confirmed that the instrument's design is robust enough, and it will remain on the spacecraft. After launch, Parker Solar Probe will use a series of Venus flybys to reduce its perihelion, or closest approach to the sun, of its elliptical orbit. The first pass of the sun, in November 2018, will bring the spacecraft about 24.8 million kilometers from the photosphere, or visible surface, of the sun. That distance will be reduced over time to 5.9 million kilometers. In those close approaches, solar scientists plan to use instruments to better understand how the sun generates the solar wind and the extreme heating of the solar corona. The mission has 24 flybys currently planned that run through the middle of 2025. The mission, previously known as Solar Probe Plus, was renamed in May 2017 after Eugene Parker, a professor emeritus in astronomy and astrophysics department of the University of Chicago. Parker predicted the existence of the solar wind as a young scientist at the university in 1958, which spacecraft discovered a few years later.

The $1.6 billion mission is targeting a pre-dawn July 31 liftoff atop United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy rocket to begin a seven-year journey to the sun. Before then, NASA's Launch Services Program, based at Kennedy Space Center, is preparing for a launch this Monday of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 flying from Launch Complex 40. The $337 million TESS mission will pick up the torch from NASA's Kepler mission to find thousands of planets orbiting nearby stars, by detecting slight dips in those stars' brightness as the planets cross, or transit. The Falcon 9 as soon as this Wednesday, April 11, could complete a standard pre-launch rehearsal and test-firing of its nine main engines. Liftoff is targeted for 6:32 p.m. Monday. This Saturday evening, the Air Force aims to launch a communications satellite and an experimental secondary mission to a high orbit atop ULA's most powerful Atlas V rocket, which features a first-stage supported by five solid rocket motors. As of Tuesday, the Air Force had not confirmed an exact launch window, as is the practice for classified missions. The window is expected to open around 6 p.m. The Air Force just recently revealed that the primary mission is called the Continuous Broadcast Augmenting Satcom, or CBAS, \"to provide communications relay capabilities to support our senior leaders and combatant commanders.\" ", "url": "https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2018/04/10/solar-probe-arrives-florida-nasa-planet-hunter-nears-launch/503616002/"}, {"title": "Old IMAX projectors simulate Sun in key test for Parker Solar Probe", "date": "2018-05-01", "content": "Making sure a critical sensor that will fly aboard NASA's $1.5 billion Parker Solar Probe will work properly when the spacecraft is being blasted by fierce light and radiation a scant 6.2 million kilometres from the Sun is no small task. But researchers at the University of Michigan who manage the spacecraft's Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons investigation - SWEAP - came up with a novel solution. They bought four vintage IMAX movie projectors on eBay for a few thousand dollars each that could be rigged to simulate the expected heat at close range to Earth's star. The SWEAP sensor, known as a Faraday cup, was mounted in a vacuum chamber at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., that was pumped down to one-billionth of an atmosphere. The light from the four projectors was directed into the chamber and onto the Faraday cup. \"It turns out a movie theatre bulb on an IMAX projector runs at about the same 5,700 degrees Kelvin, the same effective temperature as the surface of the Sun,\" Justin Kasper, the instrument's principal investigator at the University of Michigan, said in a release. \"And it gives off nearly the same spectrum of light as the surface.\" The IMAX projectors provided the blazing heat and light while an ion gun was used to beam electrically charged particles into the chamber to simulate the solar wind. And the instrument worked as expected, a final hurdle on the way to launch July 31. \"Watching the instrument track the signal from the ion beam as if it was plasma flowing from the Sun was a thrilling preview of what we will see with Parker Solar Probe,\" Kasper said. Once launched, the Parker Solar Probe will execute seven flybys of Venus over nearly seven years to reach its intended elliptical orbit well inside that of Mercury. Operating behind a 4.5-inch-thick carbon composite shield, the spacecraft's four instruments will study the plasma environment around the Sun, electric and magnetic fields and the charged particles streaming away in the solar wind. Major objectives of the mission are to help scientists understand the mechanisms responsible for heating the Sun's corona to million-degree temperatures and how the solar wind and charged particles are accelerated. A better understanding of those processes should help researchers improve solar weather forecasting in the wake of coronal mass ejections and other phenomena that can adversely affect satellites, GPS and radio communications and, in some cases, disrupt power grids.

The memory card was mounted on the spacecraft on a plaque bearing a dedication to Eugene Parker, the mission's namesake and the heliophysicist who first theorized the existence of solar wind. Photos of Parker and a copy of his groundbreaking 1958 paper were also saved to the memory card. \"Parker Solar Probe is going to revolutionize our understanding of the sun, the only star we can study up close,\" said Nicola Fox, project scientist for the Parker Solar Probe. \"It's fitting that as the mission undertakes one of the most extreme journeys of exploration ever tackled by a human-made object, the spacecraft will also carry along the names of so many people who are cheering it on its way.\" Built by scientists at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and featuring technology developed at the university's Whiting School of Engineering, the Parker Solar Probe is humanity's first mission to \"touch\" a star. The probe will explore the sun's outer atmosphere and make critical observations to answer decades-old questions about the physics of stars. The resulting data may also improve forecasts of major eruptions on the sun and subsequent space weather events that impact life on Earth, as well as satellites and astronauts in space. To protect the spacecraft from the sun's intense heat, scientists at the Whiting School developed a shield about 4 inches thick made of carbon-carbon foam and special plasma-treated coatings. The shield will keep the spacecraft and its sensitive instruments at roughly room temperature, even as the outer layer of the shield reaches almost 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit. A replica plaque and memory card were presented to Parker during a visit he made in October to view the probe at APL. \"From the experience of seeing the probe up close, I understand now the difficult task you are undertaking, and I am sure you will succeed,\" he said.

The spacecraft, which is destined for the sun, will now launch no earlier than Aug. 4. The launch window was originally scheduled to open on July 31. The Parker Solar Probe will launch on a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket from Space Launch Complex 37 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The spacecraft will fly closer to the sun's surface than any spacecraft before it, facing brutal heat and radiation conditions and ultimately providing the first-ever scientific samplings of a star's corona.

The mission, which will be humanity's first to \"touch the surface of the Sun\", is preparing for encapsulation inside its payload fairing at the Astrotech processing facility in Titusville, Florida - after which it will be mated to the top of the launch vehicle. Launch site preparations began in earnest in July and August 2017 with the arrival of the three Common Booster Cores of the Delta IV rocket that form the first stage of the Delta IV Heavy configuration. The Delta IV cores were all assembled in Decatur, Alabama, just west of Huntsville. After mating the three Common Booster Cores together, technicians inside the Horizontal Integration Facility at SLC-37B mated the Delta Cryogenic Second Stage to the top of the three boosters in March 2018. Immediately thereafter, the Parker Solar Probe itself arrived in Titusville, Florida, at the Astrotech processing center on 3 April - where its final sequence of processing activities and checkouts for launch began. For the rocket, after a month of integrated checkouts in the integration facility, United Launch Alliance engineers rolled the assembled Delta IV Heavy the short ways from its hanger to the launch mounts at SLC-37B on 16 April and erected the rocket on the pad the following day. Unlike the other rockets currently available in the U.S. fleet, the Delta IV, especially the Heavy variant, spends by far the most amount of time on its seaside launch pad undergoing final launch preparations. Extended, multi-month pad flows are not only common for this particular rocket offered by United Launch Alliance but is done, in part, to assure the rocket's functionality for critical missions - such as Parker Solar Probe, which needs to launch in a very short interplanetary launch window. To this end, extensive testing has been undertaken by the ULA team to ensure all of the Delta IV Heavy's systems are functioning properly and that any avoidable, last-minute surprises on launch day or during the duration of the launch window are evaded. The testing is not entirely foolproof, with certain elements of the rocket subject to the so-called \"lightbulb test\" - meaning regardless of how many times they are tested, they can still break or malfunction when needed. Nonetheless, such rigorous testing of the rocket in the months and weeks leading up to launch can root out several potential problems that can be fixed ahead of time, thus allowing the mission to launch without delay. For ULA, part of this campaign for Parker Solar involved Wet Dress Rehearsals: a complete fueling of the Delta IV Heavy under the same conditions it will experience on launch day and a rundown of the countdown with various anomalies thrown in to test the launch team and ensure they are ready to handle any situation that might arise during an actual launch countdown. For this particular mission, the Delta IV Heavy and ULA teams underwent two Wet Dress Rehearsals, with the first occurring on 27 June and the second following on 6 July. Following the two Wet Dress Rehearsals, updated Eastern Range schedules seem to reflect that all went well with the tests, with no major issues discovered with the rocket ahead of final integration and launch preparations. However, a small issue with the Parker Solar Probe at its Astrotech processing facility did present last Friday, 13 July. According to NASA, \"After discovering a minor tubing leak in the ground support equipment during final processing, teams require additional time for processing NASA's Parker Solar Probe spacecraft. The tubing is being repaired, and the spacecraft is healthy.\" The issue is not an impact to the scheduled launch largely because the tubing leak was on the ground side of the processing equipment and not on Parker Solar Probe itself. This is good news as Parker Solar and its third stage are scheduled to be encapsulated inside the payload fairing this week ahead of transport to the launch pad for mating and integration atop the Delta IV Heavy rocket. The third stage for the Parker Solar Probe launch is a Star 48BV solid rocket motor originally developed by Thiokol Propulsion - then ATK, then Orbital ATK, and now Northrop Grumman. The Star 48 stage takes its numerical designation from the rough diameter of the propellant casing and has been used on previous high-profile scientific missions for NASA - most notably as the third stage on the Atlas V 551 rocket that launched the New Horizons mission outward to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt in January 2006. This will be the Star 48's first use on a Delta IV Heavy. Once the Parker Solar Probe and its Star 48 upper stage are encapsulated within the payload fairing, the entire assembly will be transported to the launch pad and lifted atop the rocket, where they will be mated and secured for liftoff. Once that operation is complete, the United Launch Alliance team will perform their Mission Dress Rehearsal, currently scheduled for 1 August according to current Range schedules. The Mission Dress Rehearsal is quite different from the Wet Dress Rehearsals. In this case, the rocket will not be fueled with any propellant. Instead, the Mission Dress Rehearsal is a final countdown practice designed to be a nominal run through the count with no simulated anomalies - the purpose of which is to allow the launch team to know what to expect going into launch. While the Eastern Range schedule does not reveal the specific time at which this Mission Dress Rehearsal will take place, ULA sometimes aligns them for the actual targeted launch time, which in this case would result in a Mission Dress Rehearsal T0 of 04:17 EDT on 1 August. Depending on the mission, the launch team might also continue the Mission Dress Rehearsal past the T0 point, simulating a nominal ascent and launch all the way to payload separation. Presently, the Parker Solar Probe mission's interplanetary launch window to Venus opens on 31 July and closes on 19 August. Due to its unique science orbit, the probe must be launched at a very high velocity and use the planet Venus to gradually reduce its orbit for ever- closer approaches to the Sun. Thus, the probe must launch within the upcoming Earth-Venus alignment to permit the seven Venusian flybys required for the mission. Prior delays to spacecraft processing slipped the launch from the opening day of its window to No Earlier Than 4 August in a 45-minute launch window that extends from 04:17 to 05:02 EDT that day. As far as Eastern Range scheduling goes, Parker Solar Probe has precedence on the Range due to its need to launch within the short interplanetary window between Earth and Venus. A SpaceX mission was currently scheduled on the Range two days prior to Parker Solar Probe, with a Falcon 9 set to launch the Telkom-4 satellite from SLC-40 on 2 August about 50 and one half hours prior to Parker Solar Probe's opening launch attempt. However, the launch date for PSP has moved to the right two days via an announcement on Wednesday. The only other mission on the Range within the Parker Solar Probe window is another SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with TelStar 18V, which according to a Range manifest update on Monday, 16 July is scheduled to launch NET 17 August from SLC-40 - two days before the end of the Parker Solar Probe launch window. While neither of the SpaceX launches, right now, are impediments to the Parker Solar Probe launch, mission dates often realign and slip a few days based on previous mission actuals and overall processing timelines. Should one of the SpaceX missions become a potential impediment to Parker Solar Probe's launch, negotiations between SpaceX, NASA, United Launch Alliance, and the Eastern Range would have to take place to determine launch order. In such a scenario, it is highly likely that SpaceX would agree to slip and move around the Parker Solar Probe mission, as Range users generally try to accommodate each other and short, mission-specific launch windows - knowing full well that there might come a day when they have to ask another provider to slip due to one of their missions having to launch within a short window. Looking beyond the current August 2018 launch window, should something occur that precludes Parker Solar Probe from lifting off by the close of its interplanetary launch window on 19 August, NASA and United Launch Alliance will have to wait until May 2019 to launch the mission due to Earth-Venus orbital alignments. If the August launch date holds, this will be the first Delta IV Heavy to fly in over two years. The last Delta IV Heavy launched on 11 June 2016 from SLC-37B with Orion 9/Mentor 7 on a classified mission for the National Reconnaissance Office. A second Delta IV Heavy is currently scheduled to launch later this year, that one also for the NRO and flying from SLC-6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Following that, only five Delta IV Heavy missions remain - one per year. All of those remaining missions are for the NRO.

Saturday morning's launch at Cape Canaveral, Florida, was scrubbed a minute and 55 seconds before blast-off after a gaseous helium alarm went off. NASA will try again early Sunday to launch the Delta IV rocket, which is carrying the Parker Solar Probe. The next launch window opens at 3:31 am on Sunday. The probe's seven-year journey will bring it to within 6.16 million kilometers of the sun's surface. The probe is armed with a high-powered heat shield that is 11.43 centimeters thick. The shield is also built to sustain solar radiation levels 500 times greater than those that reach Earth. The probe will fly into a region where temperatures exceed a million degrees Fahrenheit but the sun is expected to heat the shield to a relatively modest 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. If everything goes according to plan, temperatures inside the spacecraft should be a mere 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Nicky Fox, a project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, said: \"The sun is full of mysteries.\" The Parker probe will have tools to measure the sun's expanding corona and its flowing atmosphere known as the solar wind, which was first discovered by solar physicist Eugene Parker in 1958. Parker, now 91 and eager to watch the craft blast into space, said some people doubted his initial theory. But when NASA launched its Mariner 2 spacecraft bound for Venus in 1962, it became the first robotic probe to make a successful planetary encounter, and it verified Parker's theory. \"It was just a matter of sitting out the deniers for four years until the Venus Mariner 2 spacecraft showed that, by golly, there was a solar wind,\" Parker said earlier this week. Parker described the Parker Solar Probe as a \"a very complex machine,\" and said he was \"impressed.\" The probe's main goal will be to learn the secrets of the corona, the unusual atmosphere surrounding the sun. The corona is not only 300 times hotter than the sun's surface but it also discharges powerful plasma and energetic particles that can unleash geomagnetic space storms that can wreak havoc on Earth by disrupting power grids. NASA engineers are taking every precaution with the $1.5 billion probe, which Thomas Zurbuchen, the head of NASA's science mission directorate, described as one of the space agency's most \"strategically important missions.\" Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

The United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy carrying NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission lifted off from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 3:31 a.m. Eastern. Controllers scrubbed a launch attempt the previous day because of technical issues late in the countdown. The spacecraft separated from its kick stage 43 minutes after launch. The 700-kilogram spacecraft required not only a Delta 4 Heavy but also a Star 48BV kick stage from Northrop Grumman in order to counteract the Earth's rotational speed around the sun, allowing it to fall closer to the sun. The spacecraft will also perform a series of Venus flybys, starting in early October, to bring it closer to the sun. Parker Solar Probe will perform its first close approach to the sun in November, coming within about 24.8 million kilometers. Future flybys will bring it even closer, eventually coming as close as 6.1 million kilometers, far closer than any previous spacecraft. During those later close approaches, the spacecraft will be traveling at up to 695,000 kilometers per hour. Those close approaches are needed for Parker's instruments to study the solar wind and the corona. By taking measurements from within the corona, scientists hope to better understand how it is heated to temperatures of millions of degrees. The up-close observations may reveal new information about solar eruptions and the solar wind. \"We know the magnetic field is the real key. We know this is why we're making this daring mission,\" said Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, project science for the mission, during a pre-launch briefing Aug. 9. \"We're going to go into the transition from where the magnetic field is dominant to where that coronal material dominates the magnetic field.\" Development of Parker Solar Probe - previously known as Solar Probe Plus - dates back a decade, but the idea of sending a spacecraft close to the sun is far older. Concepts for missions to travel to the sun date back to the late 1950s, around the time that University of Chicago physicist Eugene Parker, for whom the mission is named, first proposed the solar wind. \"For the science community, and some of the engineering community, it's really been 60 years,\" said Andy Driesman, project manager for the mission, during the pre-launch briefing. \"You can trace back papers and read engineering reports from the '60s and '70s about this mission, about different concepts, different ways to get this environment.\" What made the mission feasible was a set of technologies, including a heat shield that protects the spacecraft during its close approach to the sun as well as an active cooling system for the solar panels. The spacecraft also needed to be small enough that it could be launched on the desired trajectory. \"Certainly, finding the right materials\" was key, said Fox. \"It isn't just a case of surviving the incredible heat when we're close to the sun. We come out around Venus and it's cold there, which means these materials have to withstand heating and cooling, very extreme changes in temperatures.\" Parker Solar Probe has a primary mission of 24 orbits around the sun through the middle of 2025. Driesman, though, said he was optimistic that the spacecraft could operate far longer. \"As long as we have propellant on board, we're going to continue to take science data,\" he said. The mission will ultimately end when the spacecraft runs out of attitude control propellant. \"It will lose attitude control and those sensitive bits of the spacecraft, which we worked so hard to protect, will eventually transition to the sun,\" he said. \"The way I like to think about it is that, hopefully in a long, long period of time, 10 to 20 years, there's going to be a carbon disk floating around the sun in its orbit. That carbon disk will be around until the end of the solar system.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-launches-parker-solar-probe-mission-to-study-the-sun-up-close/"}, {"title": "NASA Solar Probe Hits 1st Deep-Space Milestones On Its Way to the Sun", "date": "2018-08-17", "content": "The deep-space journey of NASA's epic sun-touching mission has started out well. The Parker Solar Probe, which launched early Sunday morning from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, is notching flight milestones according to plan, NASA officials said today. For example, the spacecraft deployed its high-gain antenna, which it uses to communicate with Earth, a day after liftoff. Also, on Aug. 13, the Parker Solar Probe powered up one of its four instrument suites - the one known as the Fields Experiment. In addition, the probe has been using its thrusters to reduce momentum, an activity designed to stabilize its flight profile, NASA officials said. \"Parker Solar Probe is operating as designed, and we are progressing through our commissioning activities,\" mission project manager Andy Driesman, of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, said in a statement. \"The team - which is monitoring the spacecraft 24 hours a day, seven days a week - is observing nominal data from the systems as we bring them online and prepare Parker Solar Probe for its upcoming initial Venus gravity assist,\" he added. That Venus flyby will occur on Oct. 3, paving the way for the Parker Solar Probe's first close encounter with the sun on Nov. 5. The $1.5 billion mission will make a total of 24 close solar flybys over the next seven years. And more Venus gravity assists are coming, too - six more, in fact, after the October encounter. These Venus flybys will help sculpt and shrink the Parker Solar Probe's elliptical orbit, helping it get much closer to our star than any human-made object ever has before. During its final solar flyby, for example, the spacecraft will get within just 3.83 million miles of the sun's surface. The current close-approach record is 27 million miles, set by the German- American Helios 2 mission back in 1976. The sun's powerful gravity will accelerate the Parker Solar Probe to record- shattering speeds during these encounters. During that final solar flyby, the spacecraft will reach a top speed of about 430,000 mph. That's more than double the current mark, set by NASA's Juno probe during its arrival at Jupiter in July 2016. The Parker Solar Probe will gather a variety of data during these close passes, studying the sun's electric and magnetic fields and waves and characterizing the charged particles rocketing away from our star, among other things. These observations could help solve some long-standing mysteries - why the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, is so much hotter than its surface, for example, and how the charged particles that make up the solar wind are accelerated to their high speeds.

NASA 's Parker Solar Probe has deployed key instruments on its historic journey to the Sun. The probe blasted off on its odyssey to the star in the early hours of Aug. 12, 2018. At 11 a.m. EDT Thursday, the spacecraft was 16.27 million miles from Earth, traveling at 45,860 miles per hour, according to NASA. The average distance between the Sun and Earth is 93 million miles. The $1.5 billion mission will take humanity closer to the Sun than ever before. Parker will be the first spacecraft to fly through the Sun's corona, the outermost part of the star's atmosphere. It is expected to arrive at the Sun in November. To withstand heat of nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the probe is protected by a special 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite shield. On Sunday, four two-meter electric field antennas were deployed on the spacecraft. \"These antennas need to be extended away from the spacecraft to accurately measure the electric fields of the corona,\" explained Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, which designed and built the probe. Because they are not protected by the probe's heat shield, the antennas are constructed from niobium C-103, a high-temperature alloy that can withstand intense heat, the Lab said. Just after the antennas were deployed, the covers of the Solar Probe Analyzer instruments were opened. \"The SPAN instruments are used to measure the solar wind when it is coming in at an angle relative to the spacecraft,\" scientists said in the blog post. Voltages on the Solar Probe Cup that measures thermal solar wind plasma were also ramped up. Pointed directly at the Sun, the SPC is mounted outside the spacecraft's heat shield and is also built from niobium C-103. Additionally, the Probe's high gain antenna, which is used to send high-rate science data back to Earth, has been moved through its full range of motion, according to the Applied Physics Lab. Two Energetic Particle Instruments have also been turned on and checked, along with the spacecraft's Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe. Parker will face \"brutal\" heat and radiation during the epic journey that will take it to within 3.8 million miles of the Sun's surface, according to the space agency.

These early observations - while not yet examples of the key science observations Parker Solar Probe will take closer to the Sun - show that each of the instruments is working well. The instruments work in tandem to measure the Sun's electric and magnetic fields, particles from the Sun and the solar wind, and capture images of the environment around the spacecraft. \"All instruments returned data that not only serves for calibration, but also captures glimpses of what we expect them to measure near the Sun to solve the mysteries of the solar atmosphere, the corona,\" said Nour Raouafi, Parker Solar Probe project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland. The mission's first close approach to the Sun will be in November 2018, but even now, the instruments are able to gather measurements of what's happening in the solar wind closer to Earth. Let's take a look at what they've seen so far. As the only imager on Parker Solar Probe, WISPR will provide the clearest-yet glimpse of the solar wind from within the Sun's corona. Comprising two telescopes, WISPR sits behind the heat shield between two antennae from the FIELDS instrument suite. The telescopes were covered by a protective door during launch to keep them safe. WISPR was turned on in early September 2018 and took closed-door test images for calibration. On Sept. 9, WISPR's door was opened, allowing the instrument to take the first images during its journey to the Sun. Russ Howard, WISPR principal investigator from the Naval Research Laboratory, studied the images to determine the instrument was pointing as expected, using celestial landmarks as a guide. \"There is a very distinctive cluster of stars on the overlap of the two images. The brightest is the star Antares-alpha, which is in the constellation Scorpius and is about 90 degrees from the Sun,\" said Howard. The Sun, not visible in the image, is far off to the right of the image's right edge. The planet Jupiter is visible in the image captured by WISPR's inner telescope - it's the bright object slightly right of center in the right-hand panel of the image. \"The left side of the photo shows a beautiful image of the Milky Way, looking at the galactic center,\" said Howard. The exposure time - i.e. the length of time that light was gathered for this image, an interval which can be shortened or lengthened to make the image darker or brighter - is on the lower end, and there's a reason: \"We intentionally wanted to be on the low side in case there was something very bright when we first turned on, but it is primarily because we are looking so far from the Sun,\" explains Howard. As the spacecraft approaches the Sun, its orientation will change, and so will WISPR's images. With each solar orbit, WISPR will capture images of the structures flowing out from the corona. While measurements have been made before by other instruments at a distance of 1 AU - or approximately 93 million miles - WISPR will get much closer, about 95% of the way to the Sun from Earth, dramatically increasing the ability to see what's occurring in that region with a much finer scale than ever before and providing a more pristine picture of the solar corona. IS-IS measures high-energy particles associated solar activity like flares and coronal mass ejections. IS-IS' two Energetic Particle Instruments cover a range of energies for these activity-driven particles: EPI-Lo focuses on the lower end of the energy spectrum, while EPI-Hi measures the more energetic particles. Both instruments have gathered data under low voltage, making sure their detectors work as expected. As Parker Solar Probe approaches the Sun, they will be fully powered on to measure particles within the Sun's corona. EPI-Lo's initial data, on the left, shows background cosmic rays, particles that were energized and came rocketing into our solar system from elsewhere in the galaxy. As EPI-Lo's high voltage is turned on and Parker Solar Probe gets closer to the Sun, the particles measured will shift toward solar energetic particles, which are accelerated in bursts and come streaming out from the Sun and corona. On the right, data from EPI-Hi shows detections of both hydrogen and helium particles from its lower-energy telescopes. Nearer to the Sun, scientists expect to see many more of these particles - along with heavier elements - as well as some particles with much higher energies, especially during solar energetic particle events. \"The IS-IS team is delighted with instrument turn-on so far,\" said David McComas, Professor of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University and principal investigator of the IS-IS instrument suite. \"There are a few more steps to go, but so far everything looks great!\" The FIELDS instrument suite aboard Parker Solar Probe captures the scale and shape of electric and magnetic fields in the Sun's atmosphere. These are key measurements to understanding why the Sun's corona is hundreds of times hotter than its surface below. FIELDS' sensors include four two-meter electric field antennas - mounted at the front of the spacecraft, extending beyond the heat shield and exposed to the full brunt of the solar environment - as well as three magnetometers and a fifth, shorter electric field antenna mounted on a boom that extends from the back of the spacecraft. The data above, gathered during the boom deployment shortly after the spacecraft's launch in August, shows how the magnetic field changes as the boom swung away from Parker Solar Probe. The early data is the magnetic field of the spacecraft itself, and the instruments measured a sharp drop in the magnetic field as the boom extended away from the spacecraft. Post-deployment, the instruments are measuring the magnetic field in the solar wind - illustrating the very reason such sensors need to be held out far from the spacecraft. In early September, the four electric field antennas on the front of the spacecraft were successfully deployed - and almost immediately observed the signatures of a solar flare. \"During its commissioning time, FIELDS measured its first radio burst from a solar flare,\" said principal investigator Stuart Bale, of the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. Such bursts of radio waves can be detected during solar flares - enormous eruptions of energy and light - and are associated with the energetic electrons that flares release. This radio burst was captured by the FIELDS electric field antennas, shown above with measurements from NASA's Wind spacecraft for comparison. \"FIELDS is one of the most comprehensive fields and waves suites ever flown in space, and it is performing beautifully,\" said Bale. The SWEAP suite includes three instruments: Two Solar Probe Analyzers measure electrons and ions in the solar wind, while the Solar Probe Cup sticks out from behind Parker Solar Probe's heat shield to measure the solar wind directly as it streams off the Sun. After opening covers, turning on high voltages and running internal diagnostics, all three instruments caught glimpses of the solar wind itself. Because of Parker Solar Probe's position and orientation, the science team expected that Solar Probe Cup would mostly measure background noise at first, without picking up the solar wind. But just after the instrument was powered on, a sudden, intense gust of solar wind blew into the cup, visible in the data as the red streak. As the spacecraft approaches the Sun, such observations will be Solar Probe Cup's bread and butter - and will hopefully reveal new information about the processes that heat and accelerate the solar wind. The two Solar Probe Analyzers also caught early peeks of the solar wind. During commissioning, the team turned the spacecraft so that SPAN-A - one of the two SPAN instruments - was exposed to the solar wind directly. It captured about 20 minutes' worth of data, including measurements of solar wind ions and electrons. While SPAN-A and its sister instrument, SPAN-B, will measure solar wind electrons throughout the mission, the spacecraft's orientation now means that SPAN-A will likely go several more years before it captures such ion measurements again. This is because solar wind electrons can be measured from any direction, as their low mass and high temperature make their motion much more random, while the much heavier solar wind ions follow a relatively direct path out from the Sun. \"SWEAP's solar wind and corona plasma instrument performance has been very promising,\" said Justin Kasper, principal investigator of the SWEAP instrument suite at University of Michigan. \"Our preliminary results just after turn-on suggest we have a set of highly sensitive instruments that will allow us to do amazing science close to the Sun.\" ", "url": "https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/2018/09/19/illuminating-first-light-data-from-parker-solar-probe/"}, {"title": "Here Comes the Sun! Parker Solar Probe Instruments See 'First Light'", "date": "2018-09-25", "content": "As Parker Solar Probe prepares for an unprecedented close-up of the sun, the new spacecraft sent data home showing that all is well in the mission. The probe's instruments showed the band of the Milky Way and picked up evidence of the solar wind, the constant stream of particles emanating from the sun. The spacecraft will swoop close to the sun in November of 2018 and, over the course of seven years and many orbits, will take periodic close-ups of the sun and zoom by Venus several times. Parker will come within 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of the sun on its closest orbit; that's more than eight times closer than the planet Mercury gets to the sun. One big mystery that Parker may help shed light on, so to speak, is why the sun's corona (or upper atmosphere) is so much hotter than the layers below. The corona's temperature ranges from 1.7 million degrees Fahrenheit (1 million degrees Celsius) to more than 17 million degrees F (10 million degrees C), according to the National Solar Observatory. By contrast, the photosphere or \"surface\" of the sun reaches roughly 10,000 degrees F (5,500 degrees C). But to investigate that phenomenon, Parker's four instrument suites need to work correctly. Fortunately for mission investigators, the first data sent back in the month after launch shows that everything is working fine. \"All instruments returned data that not only serves for calibration but also captures glimpses of what we expect them to measure near the sun to solve the mysteries of the solar atmosphere, the corona,\" project scientist Nour Raouafi, who is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in Maryland, said in a NASA statement. Here's what each of the instruments returned: WISPR (Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe): A new image from the two WISPR telescopes captured a dark portion of the Milky Way galaxy as well as the star Antares, which is in the constellation Scorpius. Eventually, WISPR will send back images of the corona and other parts of the sun's atmosphere. IS\u0298IS (Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun): This consists of two instruments that measure high-energy particles associated with activity on the sun, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections of charged particles. The two instruments picked up cosmic rays (on the higher end of the energy spectrum) that come from outside of the galaxy, as well as hydrogen and helium particles (on the lower end of the energy spectrum). When the instruments are closer to the sun, they will seek evidence of solar energetic particles. FIELDS (Electromagnetic Fields Investigation): This instrument will measure magnetic and electric fields in the sun's atmosphere to help scientists better understand why the corona is so much hotter than the photosphere. The first data that FIELDS sent back was collected when the instrument's antennas, attached to a boom, were deployed, shortly after the spacecraft's launch. Investigators caught a glimpse of the spacecraft's own magnetic field during the deployment; the strength of the field dropped off as the boom extended away from the spacecraft. SWEAP (Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons): This suite has three instruments: a cup that measures the solar wind and two solar probe analyzers that look at charged particles in that wind. Investigators saw a gust of solar wind blowing into the cup shortly after they first turned on the instrument, even though the orientation of the spacecraft was not expected to yield measurements. Later on, the analyzers examined the solar wind for short periods.

NASA's mission to \"touch the sun\" is getting even closer to its solar destination, completing its first Venus gravity assist in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Parker Probe blasted off from earth Aug. 12 on a mission to learn more about solar wind and the sun's atmosphere, known as the corona. But to get close enough to study the fiery plasma surrounding the sun, the probe needs to adjust its trajectory -- and that's where Venus comes in. By slingshotting around our nearest planetary neighbour, the Parker Probe will tighten its orbit around the sun, eventually coming within 3.83 million miles of the star, which is closer to the sun than any human-made object has ever travelled. Over a mission spanning 6 years and 11 months, the spacecraft will perform a total of seven Venus gravity assist flybys, and will orbit the sun 24 times, getting closer and closer with every slingshot helping to protect it on the way). During that time, according to NASA, \"the spacecraft will go close enough to the sun to watch the solar wind speed up from subsonic to supersonic, and it will fly through the birthplace of the highest-energy solar particles.\" The goal of the mission?

As the orbits of the spacecraft and Venus converged toward the same point, Parker Solar Probe slipped in front of the planet, allowing Venus' gravity - relatively small by celestial standards - to twist its path and change its speed. This maneuver, called a gravity assist, reduced Parker's speed relative to the Sun by 10 percent - amounting to 7,000 miles per hour - drawing the closest point of its orbit, called perihelion, nearer to the star by 4 million miles. Performed six more times over the course of the seven-year mission, these gravity assists will eventually bring NASA's Parker Solar Probe's closest approach to a record 3.83 million miles from the Sun's surface - about a seventh the distance of the current record-holder, Helios 2, which achieved a pass of 27 million miles from the Sun in 1976. Even before its closest approach, Parker Solar Probe is expected to overtake this record and become the closest human-made object to the Sun in late October 2018. A solar probe has been on the minds of scientists and engineers for decades, since the late '50s, when a new theory and the first satellite measurements of the Sun's constant outflow of material, called the solar wind, pointed towards previously unsuspected complexity. But if you'd asked anyone before 2007 - well after serious planning for such a mission began - Venus would not have come up as the key to the mission puzzle. For the three-plus decades that various committees and teams worked on different concepts for the solar probe mission, it was widely agreed that the only way to dive into the solar atmosphere required sending the spacecraft to Jupiter first. \"No one believed using Venus gravity assists would be possible, because the gravity assist a planetary body can provide is proportional to the body's mass, and Venus' mass is so much smaller - only 0.3 percent of Jupiter's,\" said Yanping Guo, mission design and navigation manager for the NASA Parker Solar Probe mission at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland. \" You compare the gravity assist Venus can provide to what Jupiter can provide, and you have to do repeated flybys to achieve the same change. Then you're getting a very long mission duration.\" Getting close to the Sun is more difficult than one might think. Any spacecraft launched from Earth starts off traveling at our planet's 67,000-mile-per-hour sideways pace, speed that it must counteract before it can get anywhere near the Sun. Gravity assists are one of the most powerful tools in an orbit designer's toolbox to solve this problem: Instead of using expensive, precious fuel to change direction or speed, gravity assists let you harness the natural pull of a planet, with time as the only cost. Most deep-space missions that use planetary gravity assists use them to gain speed - like OSIRIS-Rex, which used Earth's gravity to rocket towards asteroid Bennu - or to change direction - like Voyager 2, which performed a gravity assist after its final planetary flyby at Neptune to bank toward its moon, Triton. The idea for a solar probe gravity assist was a little different. In the original orbit plans, the primary functions of the Jupiter gravity assist were to _slow_ the spacecraft's speed to almost nothing and fling it upwards, out of the nearly-flat plane that contains all of the known planets of the solar system, called the ecliptic plane. This would put the solar probe on a path to get a rare and better-than-ever look at the Sun's polar regions, which are difficult to image, but important scientifically as they produce some of the Sun's high-speed solar wind. Nearly all of our solar observatories have orbited in the ecliptic plane, with the exception of Ulysses, which used a Jupiter gravity assist to achieve polar passes more than 200 million miles from the Sun. Second, traveling that far from the Sun means you have to get creative with power. Near Jupiter, the sunlight is about 25 times dimmer than what we experience at Earth, so the only options are huge solar panels to make the most of the sparse sunlight, or some other source of power, like nuclear. Large solar panels pose a problem for a solar probe, though, because the panels would need to be shielded during solar encounters to avoid overheating. The size of a solar panel required to power the spacecraft out near Jupiter is too big to effectively stow near the Sun, so they'd have to be jettisoned at perihelion - and that limits you to just one solar pass, once you've lost your source of power. With nuclear power - a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, the same source that powers deep-space missions like Cassini and New Horizons - performing a Jupiter gravity assist is a viable option. Changing the mission paradigm: But the mission design was soon to change. David McComas, chair of the definition committee, remembers a call from Andy Dantzler, then project manager for the Solar Probe mission at APL. Dantzler passed away in 2011 at age 49; the Delta IV Heavy rocket that carried Parker Solar Probe to space was dedicated to him. \"Andy asked if there was any way the committee might go for a mission where you stay in the ecliptic plane but have lots of passes by the Sun and slowly reduce the perihelion,\" said McComas, who is now the principal investigator of the mission's Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun, or IS?IS, suite and a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University in New Jersey. This was an entirely new paradigm for the mission. A hallmark of the original plan was passing over the Sun's poles, the source of the Sun's fast solar wind but a region of relative mystery to scientists. Additionally, staying in the ecliptic plane would almost certainly mean ending up farther from the Sun than had previously been anticipated. Subsequently, two developments supported the choice to make these changes to the orbit and create the Parker Solar Probe mission we know today. The first was new research published in 2009 by Thomas Zurbuchen - then a scientist at the University of Michigan and now the associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. This research showed that the solar wind that could be measured from the ecliptic plane was actually from a diverse mix of sources. It was not only the slower solar wind known to be more common near the Sun's equator, but also the high-speed solar wind that often originates closer to the Sun's poles. By sampling the solar wind from the ecliptic plane over a period of years, scientists could learn about this fast solar wind in ways they hadn't previously anticipated. The second development was the shift that made such sampling possible: the design of Parker Solar Probe's current trajectory. \"When starting, I had no clue if I could find a solution,\" said Guo, the mission trajectory designer. \"Everybody thought Jupiter was the only practical way you could get closer to the Sun, within 10 solar radii.\" In 2007, she came up with five alternative options that would keep the spacecraft near the ecliptic plane and would not require traveling out to Jupiter. These trajectory options used some combination of Earth and Venus gravity assists to gradually draw the spacecraft closer to the Sun over the course of a number of years. One fulfilled all the requirements for the NASA Solar Probe mission - a total mission duration under 10 years, with a final close approach clocking in under 10 solar radii. This was chosen as the trajectory of the current mission, now called Parker Solar Probe after Dr. Eugene Parker, including seven Venus gravity assists that spiral the orbit in closer and closer to the Sun over the mission's seven-year lifetime. The biggest hurdle to overcome for a trajectory with such repeated gravity assists is phasing. Of course, Venus is in constant motion around the Sun, so every time the spacecraft passes the planet and swings around our star, Venus is in a completely different place. But Guo's design solves that problem, with multiple opportunities for launch. This trajectory design carries the spacecraft through 24 orbits around the Sun. The seven Venus gravity assists happen at different points in the spacecraft's orbit, to account for the phasing problem - some, like the one on October 3rd, happen as the spacecraft heads towards the Sun, while the others happen as Parker Solar Probe speeds away from the Sun. This orbit is decidedly different than the original single-Jupiter-gravity- assist concept. Rather than two passes over the Sun's poles, coming within 1.23 million miles of the surface, this version of the mission provides 24 passes around the Sun near its equator, coming within 3.83 million miles of the Sun's surface. Though Parker Solar Probe doesn't get as close to the Sun, this version of the trajectory provides the spacecraft with more than 900 hours in this critical inner region of the Sun's corona, within 20 solar radii. In comparison, earlier designs using Jupiter gravity assists provided less than 100 hours in this region. \"Here was this technical solution that was safer and cheaper and a better scientific mission because of all the samples we'd be getting,\" said McComas. \"The Sun isn't a stable object - it's variable - so this would let us do a better scientific job.\" But though it solved a major problem, rethinking the mission in this way also required a complete rethinking of the spacecraft itself. \"The whole spacecraft design changed dramatically,\" said Nicola Fox, formerly the mission's project scientist at APL. Fox is now the director of the heliophysics division at NASA Headquarters. \"With the earlier trajectory, the heat shield _was_ the spacecraft. It was like a cone, with the pointed end facing the Sun, because when you're doing such a fast polar orbit it's tough to keep a shield oriented correctly.\" \"We aren't going in as far with the new trajectory, so we could go to a simpler shape for the heat shield, because it's possible to keep the heat shield oriented between the spacecraft and the Sun at all times. The whole thing looks really different.\" The mission team credits Andy Dantzler with guiding them through this fundamental change in the mission's design that led to the mission we know today. \"When Andy called and asked if the definition team would go for it, I really didn't know the answer,\" said McComas. \"As our definition team worked through the science, I became convinced that it wasn't just an equivalent mission, but actually a better scientific mission, because we get so much more time close to the Sun and so many more samples at different times.\" During the October 3rd gravity assist, Parker Solar Probe came within about 1,500 miles of Venus' surface, reaching this closest point at about 3:45am CDT. Venus is an interesting case for heliophysicists, who study not only the Sun, but also its effects on planets. Unlike Earth, Venus doesn't have an internal magnetic field - instead, a weak magnetic field is induced over the surface by the constant barrage of solar charged particles flowing over the planet and interacting with its very dense atmosphere. Though the data is still making its way back to Earth, the science team hopes to analyze it before they set their sights on Parker Solar Probe's next major celestial encounter: its first close approach to the Sun. The NASA Parker Solar Probe's first solar encounter will happen October 31st - November 11th, with the closest approach happening on November 5th at a distance of 15 million miles from the Sun. The science data from this encounter will start downlinking to Earth in early December. Parker Solar Probe is part of NASA's Living with a Star program to explore aspects of the Sun-Earth system that directly affect life and society. The Living with a Star program is managed by the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

The probe, which was launched in August, came within 26.55 million miles of the sun on Oct. 29, at over 153,454 miles per hour.

The probe faces destructive heat-around 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit-and radiation as it makes its solar observations, so NASA engineers outfitted it with a state-of-the-art shield. Only 8 feet in diameter and 4.5 inches thick, the small shield is remarkably effective, keeping the probe at a mild 85 degrees Fahrenheit. This was the probe's first approach to the sun.

As the mission continues, the spacecraft will move even closer to the Sun, hurtling at speeds of 430,000 mph until it arrives just 4.3 million miles from the center of the Sun. \"We don't know what to expect so close to the Sun until we get the data, and we'll probably see some new phenomena,\" said Raouafi. \"Parker is an exploration mission-the potential for new discoveries is huge.\" Due to the relative positions of the Earth and the Sun, some of the data from Parker's first perihelion won't arrive at NASA until April 2019, after it's completed its second solar encounter. Until then, this tantalizing data will certainly keep scientists at NASA's Heliophysics Division busy. Aside from its location relative to the Sun, Parker Solar Probe is making history for other reasons. It's the first NASA spacecraft to be named after a living person. Appropriately, it honors solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who developed a revolutionary theory about supersonic solar winds and solar magnetic fields in the 1950s. Parker is now a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago. A memory card mounted below the probe's antenna carries photos of Parker, a copy of his revolutionary 1958 scientific paper, and the names of 1.1 million people.

The spacecraft launched on Aug. 12, 2018, and survived its first close flyby of the sun on Nov. 5 of last year, when it swooped within 15 million miles of the star. As of Jan. 19, the probe has reached its farthest distance from the sun, called aphelion, before it goes in for another close pass on April 4. The spacecraft has already delivered 17 gigabits of science data from its first orbit, NASA officials said in a statement, and will transmit its full observations from the orbit by April. \"It's been an illuminating and fascinating first orbit,\" Andy Driesman, Parker Solar Probe project manager and a researcher at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab in Maryland, which built and manages the project, said in the statement. \"We've learned a lot about how the spacecraft operates and reacts to the solar environment, and I'm proud to say the team's projections have been very accurate.\" \"We've always said that we don't know what to expect until we look at the data,\" added Nour Raouafi, a project scientist on the probe who's also at APL. \"The data we have received hints at many new things that we've not seen before and at potential new discoveries.

Parker also busted speed records, blazing by at 213,200 mph relative to the sun. On its second pass, the spacecraft will fly by at a similar distance, but in future orbits, it will break its own records, getting closer and closer to the sun. By its final planned flyby, in late 2025, the spacecraft will dive within just 3.83 million miles of the sun, accelerated by the star's gravity to nearly 430,000 mph. But for now, preparing for the spacecraft's second flyby, engineers are remotely emptying the probe of data that has already been transmitted to Earth. They're also sending updated position and navigation information, plus about a month's worth of command instructions, NASA officials said in the statement. During Parker Solar Probe's 24 total flybys, its four instruments will help researchers understand the inner workings of the sun and how it accelerates solar material at high speeds, as well as what makes the star's outer atmosphere, called the corona, so much hotter than the solar surface.

This 22 GB is 50% more data than the team had estimated would be downlinked by this point in the mission - all because the spacecraft's telecommunications system is performing better than pre-launch estimates. After characterizing the spacecraft's operations during the commissioning phase, which began soon after launch, the Parker mission team determined that the telecom system could effectively deliver more downlink opportunities, helping the team maximize the download of science data.

Since that fiery early morning liftoff with the mission's namesake, Eugene Parker, in attendance, the probe has made two full orbits of the sun, according to NASA. Humanity's first mission to a star is also the first mission to be named in honor of a living person. The pioneering astrophysicist, now 92, established a new field of solar research, heliophysics, in the 1950s. He was the first the theorize solar wind, the flow of charged gases from the sun, present in most of the solar system. The probe is on a seven-year mission to unlock the mysteries of the sun. As Nicky Fox, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division, said, \"one year down, six to go.\" But the first year has already provided scientists with a plethora of data. \"We're very happy,\" Fox said. \"We've managed to bring down at least twice as much data as we originally suspected we'd get from those first two perihelion passes.\" Four suites of instruments gather the data needed to answer key questions about the sun. FIELDS measures electric and magnetic waves around the probe, WISPR takes images, SWEAP counts charged particles and measure their properties, and ISOIS measures the particles across a wide spectrum. WISPR has returned images of the solar wind streaming out from the sun from its first pass in November. The observations and data could provide insight about the physics of stars, change what we know about the mysterious corona, increase understanding of solar wind and help improve forecasting of major space weather events. Those events can affect satellites and astronauts as well as the Earth - including power grids and radiation exposure on airline flights, NASA said. Solar wind screams past Earth at a million miles per hour, and disturbances can cause disruptive space weather that affects our planet. Surveys by the National Academy of Sciences have estimated that a solar event with no warning could cause $2 trillion in damage in the United States and leave parts of the country without power for a year. The mission's objectives include \"tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind and explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles.\" \"The data we're seeing from Parker Solar Probe's instruments is showing us details about solar structures and processes that we have never seen before,\" said project scientist Nour Raouafi of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \"Flying close to the Sun - a very dangerous environment - is the only way to obtain this data, and the spacecraft is performing with flying colors.\" Parker himself has seen some of the data returned from the two orbits. \"All I can say is wow,\" he said in a video released by the University of Chicago. \"I wouldn't be surprised if the most surprising things have yet to come.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/12/world/parker-solar-probe-one-year-scn-trnd/index.html"}, {"title": "Parker Solar Probe heading for third close pass by Sun", "date": "2019-08-14", "content": "The $1.5 billion Parker Solar Probe is heading for its third close flyby of the Sun on 1 September, and officials say the spacecraft is collecting even more data about the solar wind and the physics of the corona than initially expected. \"We're very happy,\" said Nicky Fox, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC. \"We've managed to bring down at least twice as much data as we originally suspected we'd get from those first two perihelion passes.\" Launched 12 August 2018, the Parker Solar Probe was released on a trajectory that designed to repeatedly carry it past Venus for gravity-assist flybys that will adjust the spacecraft's orbit to set up at least seven close passes through the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona.

Passing within 6.1 million kilometres of the Sun's visible surface, the Parker probe's heat shield will endure temperatures up to 1,370 degrees Celsius.

Launched last year on Aug. 12, the Parker Solar Probe is the first attempt to get close to the sun and study the solar wind at its source. Not unlike the more familiar wind in the Earth's atmosphere, the solar wind can be anything from a gentle particle breeze lighting up the Arctic night sky with green-glowing curtains of the Aurora borealis to violent gusts capable of causing global devastation. Scientists are hoping to find answers to questions that seem fundamental in nature yet have eluded them for decades - for example, where does the solar wind come from, and what causes flares and coronal mass ejections? Billed by NASA as \"humanity's first visit to a star,\" the Parker Solar Probe will conduct seven fly-bys, during which the spacecraft will approach the sun to within 10 solar radii, far enough to not burn up and close enough to dive into the sun's atmosphere, or corona. One of the most vexing problems the probe is sent to investigate is the dramatic jump in temperature the solar wind undergoes as it leaves the sun's surface and enters its corona. Across the mere relative thickness of an onion's skin, some unknown mechanism heats the particles, also known as plasma, from about 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 2 million degrees or more in the corona. According to Kristopher Klein, an assistant professor in the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, the results are expected to shed light on many fundamental physical processes. The probe carries several instruments that have made the first local measurements of the solar wind plasma, the sun's extended atmosphere that is blown off the surface and fills the solar system. Klein is affiliated with the SWEAP instrument aboard the probe, which was designed to take measurements of the thermal properties of the charged electrons and atoms that are the main components of the solar wind and coronal plasma. \"By combining these measurements, we can work toward constructing a more complete picture of how the solar wind changes as it expands from the solar surface, and what physical processes continue to act to heat this system,\" said Klein, who is affiliated with the probe's SWEAP instrument. \"We'll get close enough to where most of the mechanisms that are pushing the particles out are still actively doing that pushing,\" he said, adding that the mission will provide a better understanding of the space weather around Earth and allow predictions when to send astronauts to Mars or protect a satellite before it gets ripped apart by a radiation burst.

The four instrument suites onboard - FIELDS, IS-IS, SWEAP, and WISPR - have been observing the characteristics of the solar wind in the immediate environment surrounding the Sun, called the corona. With three of 24 planned solar orbits under its belt, the Parker Solar Probe will continue to get closer to the sun in the coming years, eventually swooping to within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, facing heat and radiation like no spacecraft before. \"This is an exciting time to be a heliophysicist,\" said Lunar and Planetary Laboratory professor Joe Giacalone, who is on the team of IS-IS, an instrument that detects very energetic particles. \"The data that is now publicly available comes from a region of space we have never sampled previously. With many brilliant scientists now poring through this amazing data set, new discoveries about our star are soon coming.\" Paying a close visit to the sun also provides an opportunity to learn about phenomena such as other stars, plasma accretion disks around black holes and the interstellar medium, a very low-density plasma that fills the galaxy. Sending the Parker Solar Probe to the sun might even help with developing plasma on Earth - for example, developing fusion reactors that could someday provide sustainable energy. \"Releasing this data to the public will allow them not only to contribute to the success of the mission along with the scientific community, but also to raise the opportunity for new discoveries to the next level,\" said the mission's project scientist Nour E.

NASA named the solar mission after the famed astrophysicist in 2017. Parker, now 92, is poring over the probe's early results with interest. \"Now that the data is finally coming in and being analyzed, things are getting really exciting,\" he said. \"We've already seen evidence for some very surprising phenomena-which you should always expect when you travel into regions where spacecraft have never been before. That is part of the excitement of these missions, and I'm looking forward to what comes next.\" \"It is appropriate that a spacecraft named in honor of our colleague Eugene Parker, who made contributions across nearly all of heliophysics, should have findings that are so immediately diverse and interesting,\" said Angela Olinto, dean of the Division of the Physical Sciences and the Albert A. Michelson Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. \"These findings represent an incredible opportunity to help us unravel the many mysteries that stars still hold.\" Though it may seem placid to us here on Earth, the sun is anything but quiet. Our star is magnetically active, unleashing powerful bursts of light, particles moving near the speed of light and billions of tons' worth of material. What happens on the sun is critical to understanding how it shapes the space around us. Most of the material that escapes it is part of the solar wind, a continual outflow of ionized gas, called plasma. This plasma carries with it the sun's magnetic field, stretching it out through the solar system in a giant bubble that spans more than 10 billion miles. A simulation of \"switchbacks,\" reversals in the direction of the magnetic field embedded in the solar wind. Closer to the solar wind's source, Parker Solar Probe saw a much different picture from the one we have on Earth: a complicated, active system. One event in particular drew the eye of the science teams: flips in the direction of the magnetic field, which flows out from the sun, embedded in the solar wind. These reversals, dubbed \"switchbacks,\" last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes as they flow over Parker Solar Probe. During a switchback, the magnetic field whips back on itself until it is pointed almost directly back at the sun. \"Waves have been seen in the solar wind from the start of the space age, and we assumed that closer to the sun the waves would get stronger, but we were not expecting to see them organize into these coherent structured velocity spikes,\" said Prof. Justin Kasper, AB'99, of the University of Michigan, a UChicago alum whose team helped build one of the instruments aboard the probe. \"We are detecting remnants of structures from the Sun being hurled into space and violently changing the organization of the flows and magnetic field. This will dramatically change our theories for how the corona and solar wind are being heated.\" ", "url": "https://news.uchicago.edu/story/parker-solar-probes-first-discoveries-odd-phenomena-space-weather-solar-wind"}, {"title": "Parker Solar Probe's first discoveries: Odd phenomena in space weather, solar wind", "date": "2019-12-08", "content": "The Sun is sending out sudden, violent bursts of solar wind so powerful that the magnetic field flowing out from the Sun flips itself in the opposite direction. That's the totally unexpected news sent back to Earth from NASA's Parker Solar Probe, the car-sized spacecraft launched in 2018. Its mission is to journey closer to the Sun than any other human-made object. Parker has sent back masses of information from its close encounter with the Sun, which scientists have published in recent days. The information is helping them understand how the Sun makes the weather in space and the impacts of the violent solar wind that can hamper* satellites and electronics on Earth. \"We were certainly hoping we'd see new phenomena* and new processes when we got close to the Sun - and we certainly did,\" said Nicola Fox, director of the US space agency's heliophysics* division. \"Some of the information that we found pretty much confirmed what we expected, but some of it is totally unexpected.\" Earth is roughly 150 million km from the Sun. The probe ventured as close as 24 million km to the Sun to gather the data used in the studies published in the journal _Nature_. On its last approach, the probe will get as close as 6 million km from the sun's surface, seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. The probe has endured extreme heat while flying through the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere, called the solar corona, that gives rise to solar wind - the hot, energised, charged particles that stream outward from the Sun and fill the solar system. Despite the extreme heat, the instruments on-board have to stay at room temperature. The spacecraft is protected by a hi-tech solar shield that swivels to stay between the body of the spacecraft and the Sun and includes, among other things, carbon fibre panels, which here on Earth we use to make expensive bike frames and racing yachts. One of the probe's \"really big surprises,\" according to one of the researchers, was the detection of sudden, abrupt spikes in the speed of the solar wind. The bursts were so violent that the magnetic field flips itself around, a phenomenon called \"switchbacks.\" Dr Fox compared this unexpected switchback phenomenon to the cracking of a whip. \"We're finding these discrete, powerful waves that wash over the spacecraft, kind of like rogue waves in an ocean,\" said Justin Kasper, a principal investigator whose team at the University of Michigan, US, built a solar wind- sensing instrument on the Parker probe. \"They carry a tremendous amount of energy.\" \"This will dramatically change our theories for how the corona and solar wind are being heated,\" Kasper said. Researchers said they also finally have evidence of a dust-free zone encircling the Sun. Farther out, there's so much dust from vaporising comets and asteroids that one of 80 small viewfinders on one instrument was pierced by a dust grain earlier this year. Parker will sweep past Venus on December 26 to get a speed boost from the planet's gravity. It will make its fourth close solar encounter in January.

Launched back in August 2018 and named after University of Chicago astrophysicist Dr. Eugene Parker, who first presented the notion of solar winds, this dramatic $1.5 billion odyssey was designed to assist scientists in deciphering the intricate mechanics of the shining star in our sky. Like the ambitious goals of the astronauts in Ray Bradbury's solar-themed short story, \"The Golden Apples of the Sun,\" the Parker Solar Probe has already been breaking records in flying faster and closer to the sun than any other man-made object in history. Mission team members are mostly focused on uncovering a pair of unsolved puzzles regarding the inner workings of the sun: just how the solar wind, a violent stream of particles constantly flowing from the sun, accelerates to incredible velocities; and why the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere, is so much hotter than its solar surface. Fortified and protected by a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite shield, the craft and its sensitive instruments will dip down into the sun's scorching corona for a close encounter every 5+ months for a never-seen look inside its atomic fires. Outlined in four newly published reports, the first two perihelion passes occurring in November 2018 and April 2019 brought the PSP within 15 million miles of the solar surface, which is the closest pass to date. Prior to this, the next closest a craft came to the sun was 26.55 million miles when Helios 2 dove in for an intimate peek in 1976. At that time, Helios 2 also set a world record for the fastest speed relative to the sun, at 153,454 mph. This record was bested by NASA's Juno orbiter in July 2016, when it topped 165,000 mph on its its rendezvous with Jupiter. However, PSP shattered both records in the midst of its first perihelion pass in November, when the sun's powerful gravity rocketed the craft to 213,243 mph. Findings from the Fields Experiment, one of four targeted studies, reveal that slow solar winds are not only emanating from large coronal holes similar to fast solar winds, but also emerging from smaller patches situated near the solar equator. Fields also recorded sudden reversals in the solar magnetic field surging past the spacecraft where the field often quickly shifted orientation 180 degrees flipped back again after a few seconds or minutes, possibly due to plasma jets. Another particle-observing experiment, ISoIS, has detected radical proton, electron, and ion bursts that go unnoticed by Earth-based instruments. \"It's amazing - even at solar minimum conditions, the sun produces many more tiny energetic particle events than we ever thought,\" said Princeton University's David McComas, ISoIS principal investigator and study lead author, in a statement. \"These measurements will help us unravel the sources, acceleration, and transport of solar energetic particles and ultimately better protect satellites and astronauts in the future.\" Watch the 92-year-old Dr. Parker react to the initial findings of the intrepid craft that bears his name in the touching video below: Many mysteries remain, but the PSP team has five more years of mission time to solve these puzzles, as the probe will keep studying the sun until 2025, with its perihelion passes inching closer and closer to the cosmic inferno, using flybys of Venus for path corrections. Its orbital period is currently calculated at approximately 150 Earth days, but that will be diminished to 88 days by the end of the mission. The spacecraft's grand finale will bring it within 3.83 million miles of the sun's surface at a blistering 430,000 mph, a dizzying speed even Santa's magic sleigh could never match.

But it is not restricted to just studying the Sun, as recently the probe captured a never-before-seen site - an image of the Phaethon asteroid's dust trail. The asteroid is from the group of Apollo asteroids that brings it extremely close to the Eartha and the Sun. Phaethon, in Greek mythology, is the son of the Sun god Helios. This asteroid is also the parent body of the Geminids meteor showers that take place every year, in mid-December and is thought to be intensifying every year with 120-160 meteors seen per hour. A parent body of the meteoroid showers is a celestial body from where meteorites originate. The probe captured the first-ever direct view of the 96,560 km dust trail following the asteroid. This trail, made up of dust grains, small rocks and other space debris, comes in contact with the Earth's atmosphere and burns upon impact. It is also the reason why we see the meteoroid showers or shooting stars on Earth - they are just small rocks burning. While scientists have always known that Phaethon is the parent body that causes the showers, they have never been able to see the dust trail. The extremely sensitive Hubble telescope had also been employed to look at the asteroid but came up empty. \"We calculate a mass on the order of a billion tons for the entire trail, which is not as much as we'd expect for the Geminids, but much more than Phaethon produces near the Sun,\" said Karl Battams, a space scientist at the US Naval Research Lab in Washington DC, said in a statement. \"This implies that WISPR is only seeing a portion of the Geminid stream - not the entire thing - but it's a portion that no one had ever seen or even knew was there, so that's very exciting!\" Astronomers will be able to study the asteroid, its dust trail and the showers in even more detail with Parker's new image. They might even be able to explain how the asteroid came to be.

Made of electrons, protons, and heavier ions, the solar wind courses through the solar system at roughly 1 million mph, barreling over everything in its path. Scientists have studied the solar wind for over 60 years, yet despite everything, they're pondered over some of its behaviors. While they realize it originates from the Sun's million-degree upper atmosphere called the corona, the solar wind, for instance, doesn't slow down, it leaves the Sun - it accelerates. It has a kind of internal heater that prevents it from cooling as it speeds through space. With developing concern about the solar wind's ability to interfere with GPS satellites and disturb power grids on the ground, it's become imperative to understand it better. Just 17 months since launch, and after three orbits around the Sun, Parker Solar Probe hears the sound of the solar wind and reveals that the sound blows like a hurricane's scream. The sound hint at the origin of this mysterious and ever-present wind. And now the Parker Solar Probe team is getting their first chance to hear them, too. Project Scientist Nour Raouafi, from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, in Laurel, Maryland, said, \"We expected to make big discoveries because we're going into uncharted territory. What we're seeing is beyond anything anybody imagined.\" According to scientists, plasma waves in the solar wind could be responsible for some of the wind's odd characteristics. They believe that it can certainly play a part in heating and accelerating the particles, but they don't know how much of a part. Here Parker Solar Probe can play a significant role. The spacecraft's FIELDS instrument can eavesdrop on the electric and magnetic fluctuations caused by plasma waves. And it can \"hear\" when the waves and particles interact with one another, recording frequency and amplitude information about these plasma waves that scientists could then play as sound waves. David Malaspina, a member of the FIELDS team, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said, _\"Nobody knows what causes these chirping waves or what they do to heat and accelerate the solar wind. That's what we're going to be determining. I think it's incredibly exciting.\" The probe not only heard just plasma waves but while barreling through a cloud of microscopic dust, the spacecraft's instruments also captured a sound resembling old TV static. That static-like sound is hundreds of little impacts happening every day as dust from asteroids torn apart by the Sun's gravity and solar heating and particles stripped from comets as they graze the star strikes the spacecraft at speeds close to a quarter of a million miles per hour. As the spacecraft cruised through this dust cloud, the shuttle not only crashed into these particles - it obliterated them. Each grain's atoms burst apart into electrons, protons and other ions in a mini puff of plasma that the FIELDS instrument can hear. James Kinnison, the Parker Solar Probe mission system engineer at APL, said: \"This discrepancy in dust density is just one more reason why Parker being close to the Sun is so useful.\" \"We protected almost everything from the dust. And although the dust is denser than expected, nothing right now points to dust impacts being a concern for the mission.\" ", "url": "https://www.techexplorist.com/sound-solar-wind-nasa-parker-solar-probe/29190/"}, {"title": "NASA's Parker Solar Probe hears whispers of solar wind", "date": "2020-01-28", "content": "Streams of plasma from the sun create \"chirping\" and \"whistling\" noises, and NASA's Parker Solar Probe can hear them. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the sun's upper atmosphere, also known as the corona. This plasma consists of electrons, protons and other charged particles that flow from the sun's atmosphere and out into the solar system at roughly 1 million mph. Launched in August 2018, NASA's Parker Solar Probe has studied the sun up close since arriving at the star in November 2018. Recent analysis of these observations has revealed small chirps, squeaks and rustles produced by the solar wind, according to a statement from Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. \"We are looking at the young solar wind being born around the sun,\" Nour Raouafi, a mission project scientist at APL, said in the statement. \"And it's completely different from what we see here near Earth.\" Earlier observations of the solar wind have shown that the charged particles don't slow down as they leave the sun; they actually speed up. One of the goals of the Parker Solar Probe is to better understand how exactly the charged particles get accelerated. Using the probe's Electromagnetic Fields Investigation instrument, researchers have observed fluctuations in electric and magnetic fields caused by plasma waves within the solar wind streaming from the sun. Scientists think that particles can ride these plasma waves, which, in turn, may propel the particles to higher speeds, according to the statement. Data from the FIELDS instrument showed the frequency and amplitude of interactions between plasma waves and particles, which researchers were then able to turn into audible sound waves. \"Plasma waves certainly play a part in heating and accelerating the particles. Scientists just don't know how much of a part,\" Raouafi said in the statement. \"We are seeing new, early behaviors of solar plasma we couldn't observe here at Earth, and we're seeing that the energy carried by the waves is being dissipated somewhere along the way, to heat and accelerate the plasma.\" The researchers identified several different sound waves in this data. They found that energetic electrons that follow magnetic field lines stretching from the sun out into the solar system create whistler- mode waves when amplified by plasma waves at the same frequency. Additionally, the researchers found that dispersive plasma waves create a \"chirp\" sound when they quickly shift from one frequency to another as they move through the solar wind, according to the statement. The probe also captured static-like sounds as it moved through a cloud of microscopic dust and collided with particles, which burst apart into electrons, protons and other constituent particles upon impact. \"These waves haven't been detected in the solar wind before, at least not in any large numbers,\" David Malaspina, a member of the FIELDS team and an assistant professor at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in the statement. \"Nobody knows what causes these chirping waves or what they do to heat and accelerate the solar wind.

Now, scientists have translated some of the probe's measurements into funky sound clips that you can listen to on their SoundCloud page or in the embedded video below. We're hearing motions in the wind blowing off of the Sun's surface. The whooshing and whistling noises are waves in the hot, electrically charged plasma that come off of the Sun's wispy outer layers, or corona, and stream through space as solar wind. One of the Parker Solar Probe's primary goals is to probe why the Sun's corona is so much hotter than the Sun's surface - and thus how the particles in the solar wind have so much energy. By studying these plasma waves, researchers hope to understand what processes are heating up the corona and accelerating the solar wind. Though these audio clips were never sound, per se, the data does share some similarities with sound here on Earth. The Parker Solar Probe measures pressure waves in the particles that make up solar wind. In our daily lives, we hear pressure waves as sound. The Parker Solar Probe doesn't have a microphone on board, but its instruments can measure the frequencies and amplitudes of these waves in the solar wind. Scientists then turned those wave measurements into sound waves, creating clips of what the waves might sound like to the human ear. The plasma waves that Parker Solar Probe is capturing are the result of particles interacting with magnetic and electric fields. When electrons spin around a magnetic field, they can generate pressure waves, which the spacecraft picks up on. This type of wave, called a Whistler wave, also forms in Earth's magnetosphere, the region around our planet that's dominated by Earth's magnetic fields. Another type of wave the probe picked up in the solar wind is called a Langmuir wave. These are very high-frequency pressure waves - rapid fluctuations in densities of electrons that form when beams of electrons stream along magnetic fields. Translated into sound waves, the Langmuir waves here make an ethereal, high-pitched keening. Understanding how particles interact with magnetic and electric fields may reveal what physical processes are heating up the corona and accelerating the solar wind. Plasma waves, like those captured by the Parker Solar Probe and featured in these sound clips, are one possible explanation for this energy transfer process, according to Nour Raouafi, the project scientist for Parker Solar Probe at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory. Particles may be getting a boost by traveling on these waves, Raouafi said, like surfers riding ocean waves at the beach. \"Parker Solar Probe, by going to the source of the solar wind, is basically revealing to us a new picture of the young solar wind,\" Raouafi said. \"It's actually providing us with the missing pieces of the corona puzzle that we have been looking for over the last 60 years.\" ", "url": "https://astronomy.com/news/2020/01/you-can-listen-to-the-solar-wind-thanks-to-nasas-parker-solar-probe"}, {"title": "NASA's Parker Solar Probe began its longest observation campaign to date", "date": "2020-05-19", "content": "On May 9, 2020, Parker Solar Probe started its longest science observation campaign.

Those observations revealed significant rotation of the solar wind and solar wind phenomena occurring much farther from the Sun. The instruments will collect data through June 28. The probe will arrive at its closest point to the Sun for this orbit called perihelion, on June 7. At perihelion, Parker Solar Probe will be about 11.6 million miles from the Sun 's surface, coordinating its record for a human human-made object to the Sunset during its fourth circle on Jan. 29. After this solar encounter, the shuttle will swoop by Venus for its first outbound flyby of the planet. This is when Parker Solar Probe will play out its third Venus gravity assist. It will permit the shuttle to shed a portion of its orbital energy and get a lot nearer to the Sun on the next orbit.

The Probe captured the twin tails of NEOWISE, also known as C/2020 F3, when it became active just after its closest approach to the Sun. Many comets have two tails - a dust tail and another made of electrically-charged particles. However, in the case of NEOWISE, it was predicted that it has two ion tails, which intrigued researchers. NASA's NEOWISE space telescope, the comet's namesake, discovered the comet on 27 March 2020. According to NASA, the lower tail is the dust tail of NEOWISE and it is created when dust lifts off the surface of the comet's nucleus and trails behind it in its orbit. \"The upper tail is the ion tail, which is made up of gases that have been ionized by losing electrons in the Sun's intense light,\" the space agency said in the release. These ionised gases are battered repeatedly by the solar wind. As a result of this, the ion tail is created that extends directly away from the Sun. Scientists speculate that NEOWISE has two ion tails, in addition to its dust tail, but they need more data and analysis to confirm this. Last month, NASA came up with some simulations showing how the sunset would look on other planets of the solar system. It was created by Geronimo Villanueva, a planetary scientist from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The simulations showed at the time of sunset on Uranus a bright blue colour in the sky fades into royal blue with hints of turquoise. The blue green colour appeared due to the interaction of sunlight with the atmosphere of the planet. A bright yellow sky turns into orange, brown, and finally black during the sunset on Venus.

The spacecraft made its previous close approach in September. And although the sun's activity gradually increased in 2020 with the arrival of a new solar cycle, dubbed solar cycle 25, that began early in 2020, the sun wakes up slowly, and the star only released its first major flare in three years in November. The 11-year solar cycle governs both the sun's activity and its influence around Earth and across the solar system. The more active the sun is, the more dark sunspots dot its surface; these are also the locations from which massive blasts of solar plasma, called coronal mass ejections, originate. Parker Solar Probe made its closest approach to the sun at 12:39 p.m. EST on Sunday. At that point, the spacecraft was about 8.4 million miles away from the sun's surface and traveling at nearly 290,000 mph, according to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which runs the spacecraft. Next, on Feb. 20, the spacecraft will fly past Venus before making another close approach to the sun on Apr. 29.

On its mission toward the Sun, NASA's Parker Solar Probe captured a striking image of Venus that unexpectedly revealed features of the planet's surface and atmosphere, reports Meghan Bartels for Space.com. The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to study the Sun's atmosphere and will get closer than any other spacecraft has before to the celestial object, reports Ashley Strickland for CNN. Using Venus's gravity, the Parker Probe will circle our host star seven times while getting closer and closer over the course of seven years. Aboard the probe is the Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe or WISPR. It is designed to take visible-light images of the Sun's corona and solar wind using two optical telescopes, reports George Dvorsky for Gizmodo. On July 11, 2020, during the Parker Probe's third orbit around Venus, researchers used the WISPR instrument to image the planet. Expecting to see the Venusian surface blocked by clouds, the team was astonished to find that WISPR captured temperature differences on Venus's surface. In the Parker Probe's ghostly image, a dark spot is pictured in the middle of Venus. That dark spot is the most significant highland region on the planet's surface, called Aphrodite Terra, and appeared darker than the rest of the planet because the area was cooler by 85 Fahrenheit planet, _Space.com_ reports. This surprised researchers because WISPR was designed to detect visible light. If WISPR can image Venus's surface through its thick cloudy atmosphere, it meant it was detecting thermal radiation and had the previously unknown ability to image near-infrared light, _Gizmodo_ reports. \"WISPR is tailored and tested for visible-light observations. We expected to see clouds, but the camera peered right through to the surface,\" said Angelos Vourlidas, a WISPR project scientist from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, in a statement. In the image taken 7,693 miles away from Venus, WISPR also captured a glowing ring around the planet and streaks of light skidding across the foreground. The bright ring, also known as nightglow, may be caused by light emitted from oxygen atoms high up in Venus's atmosphere, reports _Space.com_. The streaks seen in the image may be from space dust, traces of cosmic rays or particles reflecting sunlight, CNN reports. The images WISPR took of Venus's surface are similar to the photos, Akatuski, a Japanese orbiter studying Venus since 2015, has taken, reports CNN. Akatuski studies weather patterns and active volcanoes on Venus using infrared light. \"WISPR effectively captured the thermal emission of the Venusian surface,\" said astrophysicist and WISPR team member Brian Wood in a statement, \"It's very similar to images acquired by the Akatsuki spacecraft at near-infrared wavelengths.\" The stunning images taken by Akatuski and WISPR spacecrafts have come a long way from the first images seen of the Venusian Surface. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union launched various satellites named Venera to observe Venus, as reported by Amy Shira Teitel for _Popular Science_ in 2015. Venera 9 took the first photographs of Venus's surface. To further explore Venus's atmosphere and see if WISPR is picking up infrared light off of Venus, more images were taken during the Parker Probe's fourth orbit around the planet on February 20 2021 at 1,500 miles from the surface, reports Space.com. The images' results won't be seen until April but could reveal further secrets of the Venusian planet. \"If WISPR can sense the thermal emission from the surface of Venus and nightglow - most likely from oxygen - at the limb of the planet, it can make valuable contributions to studies of the Venusian surface,\" comments planetary scientist Javier Peralta from the Akatsuki team in a statement.

The image shows the first complete view of a dust ring surrounding Venus. The dust ring's particles stretch for the entirety of the planet's path around the sun. Researchers published the new images on April 6, and they cover almost the entire 360-degree view of the ring. Researchers say the images represent a complete picture of the dust ring that scientists had only seen hints of previously. Those previous hints came from images taken by the Helios probes in the '70s. Hints of dust rings had also been observed in work from the NASA Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory probes between 2007 and 2014. The lead author of the study Guillermo Stenborg from the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, says that this is the first time a circumsolar dust ring in the inner solar system has been fully revealed via \"white light\" images. The main duty for the Parker Solar Probe is to study the Corona of the sun and solar wind. However, the team operating the probe did intend from the beginning to try and capture images of the Venusian dust ring using Parker's Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe. WISPR has two telescopes that work together to provide a field-of-view of more than 95 degrees. It was designed to capture wide-angle images of the solar wind and white light. The first glimpse at the Venusian dust ring in WISPR images was discovered using images from the spacecraft in August and September 2019 as it performed a series of rolling maneuvers to manage momentum. The rolling maneuvers made seeing the ring possible as it allowed for customized image processing to reveal faint, stationary features.

NASA's Parker Solar Probe, which launched in 2018, has set two records at once: the closest spacecraft to the sun and the highest speed reached. On 29 April, the probe made its closest pass yet to the sun, a little more than 10 million kilometres from its surface. During the time of closest approach, it was travelling at about 150 kilometres per second relative to the sun, the fastest any spacecraft has ever moved. At this rate, it would take about 4.5 minutes to cover the entire circumference of Earth, or around 40 minutes to fly from Earth to the moon. It is about 0.05 per cent of the speed of light. ##### Advertisement But the Parker Solar Probe isn't done yet: the fly-by of the sun on 29 April was only the spacecraft's eighth pass out of a planned 24 before the end of the mission in late 2025. On each pass, the probe first sails out past Venus to use the planet's gravity to shape its orbit, pushing the spacecraft closer and closer to the sun. That proximity will help it swing by at increasing speeds, with a planned top speed of around 200 kilometres per second. At that pace, it will be almost three times faster than the previous record-holders, a pair of spacecraft called the Helios probes that studied the sun in the 1970s. At its closest, the Parker Solar Probe will be just less than 7 million kilometres from the sun, more than 6 times closer to it than the Helios probes were, which held the record until Parker broke it in 2018. While the spacecraft is close to the sun, its goals lie beneath the surface - the probe is designed to measure the magnetic fields in the region and trace the flow of energy within the sun. These measurements should help researchers understand how the sun blasts out the energetic particles that make up the solar wind, as well as the mystery of why the outermost layer of the sun is hotter than the inner layers.

It was clocked zipping through the Sun's outer atmosphere at 532,000 kilometers per hour. To give you a sense of this achievement, let's put it in another context: Something made by humans just swung past the Sun at about 0.05 percent of the speed of light. The solar probe already held the record for the fastest human-made object at 393,044 km/h, and the closest to the Sun at 18.6 million kilometers, recorded back in February 2020. Now, it's smashed those, coming in at 10.4 million kilometers from our star. And it's set to go even further and faster. The probe will take another 4 years to reach its closest approach, using flybys of Venus as a slingshot to get closer to the Sun. The spacecraft will eventually enter an extremely close orbit around the Sun, getting as close as just 8.5 times the Sun's radius from the solar surface. The next Venus flyby is on October 16, this year, and the next closest record- breaking encounter with the Sun will be on November 21.

Launched in 2018, the Parker Solar Probe is NASA's latest and most ambitious effort to investigate the sun. To date, it has gotten closer to the sun than any other mission; its equipment has operated at the hottest temperatures of any spacecraft; and the probe is the fastest human- made object ever. However, the extraordinary speed at which the Parker Solar Probe flies - about 447,000 mph during its closest approaches to the sun - means that running into even a tiny grain of dust can trigger explosions, which could make the probe the most sand-blasted spacecraft ever. \"The Parker Solar Probe has been struck by dust tens of thousands of times,\" study lead author David Malaspina, a space plasma physicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told Space.com. \"During its ninth orbit of the sun, of 24 total planned orbits, there were periods where the Parker Solar Probe was struck by a hypervelocity dust grain every 12 seconds on average.\" To learn more about the kind of havoc these collisions might wreak, the researchers analyzed data gathered by the probe's antennas and magnetic field sensors. The result is the most complete picture yet of how hypervelocity dust impacts - ones that occur at more than 6,700 mph - may damage a spacecraft and disturb its operations. While flying near the sun, the Parker Solar Probe barrels through the densest region of the zodiacal cloud. This thick, pancake-shaped cluster of dust, which extends throughout the solar system, is made up of tiny dust grains from asteroids and comets. As the spacecraft hurtles through this cloud, thousands of dust grains about 2 to 20 microns wide strike it at hypervelocity, generating explosions that last less than a thousandth of a second. In comparison, the average human hair is about 100 microns wide. Upon impact, the dust grains and the impacted spacecraft surface get heated so much that they vaporize and then fragment into electrons and ions, forming plasma, the same state of matter that makes up _stars_ and lightning. \"While most dust impacts cause only small effects, a few are very high energy, creating the debris and dense plasma clouds that we focused on in this research,\" Malaspina said. \"We identified about 250 of these very high-energy impacts during the first eight orbits of Parker Solar Probe around the sun.\" The largest of these collisions also generate clouds of debris that slowly expand away from the probe. \"Dust impact plasma clouds have been observed on spacecraft since the 1980s, when Voyager passed through the ring plane of Saturn, but no impact plasma cloud observed prior to this has been dense enough to cause such clearly measurable effects,\" Malaspina said. As much as dust is pummeling the Parker Space Probe, it remains operational, Malaspina noted. \"Most of the dust grains that strike the spacecraft are very small,\" Malaspina noted. \"While this very efficiently sandblasts the spacecraft surface, the risk of encountering a dust grain large enough to cause a catastrophic failure remains low.\" This new data can help scientists tinker with spacecraft designs to better protect them from hypervelocity impacts, as well as the resulting plasma and debris, Malaspina said. For example, researchers may want \"to carefully consider the fragmentation properties of exterior materials under hypervelocity impacts,\" he explained. \"This is particularly true for missions where uninterrupted star camera navigation is important, or where electromagnetic attraction of spacecraft debris to spacecraft surfaces may be a concern.\" This research is also helping scientists map the structure and density of the interplanetary dust cloud near the sun, \"which has never been done with direct spacecraft measurements,\" Malaspina said. \"This can inform updated models of this environment and drive more accurate predictions of dust impact danger on any future missions.\" In addition, these findings could lead to new insights into space weather around the sun. For example, the measurements allowed the team to study how these plasma explosions interacted with the solar wind, the stream of particles flowing from the sun. This information, in turn, can shed light on how larger amounts of plasma, such as those found in the upper atmospheres of Venus and Mars, are swept away by the solar wind, Malaspina said. The scientists will detail their findings Nov. 11 at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society's division of plasma physics in Pittsburgh. They have also submitted their work to the Astrophysical Journal.

Scientists at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory have examined collisions between the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft and dust. Traversing near-sun space at up to 180 kilometres per second, Parker Solar Probe ploughs through the densest region of the zodiacal cloud. The zodiacal cloud is a thick, pancake-shaped dust cloud that extends throughout the solar system and comprises tiny dust grains shed from asteroids and comets. As Parker Solar Probe barrels through this region, the study found that thousands of tiny dust grains strike the spacecraft at hypervelocity. Upon impact, the material that makes up the dust grains and the spacecraft surface is heated so much that it first vapourises, then ionises. Ionisation occurs when atoms in the vaporised material are separated into their constituent ions and electrons, producing a state of matter called plasma. The rapid vapourisation and ionisation create a plasma explosion lasting less than one-thousandth of a second. The largest of these impacts also generate clouds of debris that slowly expand away from the spacecraft. The findings could lead to new insights into space weather around the Sun and have significant implications for the safety of future spacecraft. The team observed how metallic flakes and paint chips knocked loose during collisions with dust drifted and tumbled near the spacecraft. Those pieces of debris created streaks in the images taken by navigational and scientific cameras on the Parker Solar Probe. The study also reported that some debris scattered sunlight into the Parker Solar Probe navigation cameras, temporarily preventing the spacecraft from determining its orientation in space. That can be a dangerous prospect for a spacecraft that relies on the precise pointing of its heat shield to survive. Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 and has completed nine full orbits of the Sun. Before its prime mission ends in 2025, it will complete another 15 orbits.

Whats exciting about this is its greatly improving our understanding of the innermost regions of our heliosphere, giving us insight into an environment that, until now, was a total mystery, said Nour Raouafi, Parker Solar Probe project scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. Apart from tracking solar wind, the spacecraft is also studying plasma from the Sun. Nasa said that as dust grains pelt the spacecraft along its path, the high-velocity impacts create clouds of plasma. These clouds produce unique electrical charges that are picked up by several sensors on the probes FIELDS instrument, which is designed to measure the electric and magnetic fields near the Sun. The visible imaging camera, WISPR, captures dust structures far away from the spacecraft, such as the dust ring that shares Venus orbit. WISPR and FIELDS have planned for specifically investigating near-Sun dust in a region of the solar system where no mission has ever operated. We designed materials and components that survive hypervelocity dust impacts and the effects of the even smaller particles created in these impacts. We modelled the makeup and effects of the dust environment, tested how materials react to the dust particles, and installed fault-tolerant onboard systems that are keeping Parker Solar Probe safe in this unexplored region, said Jim Kinnison, Parker Solar Probe mission systems engineer in a statement. The probe, when at its closest to the Sun, will be flying at 5,86,800 kilometres per hour thanks to the gravity assist from Venus last month. The spacecraft swooped 3,814 kilometres above Venus' surface to reduce its orbital energy, which in turn allows it to travel closer to the Sun and measure the properties of the solar wind near its source. This was the fifth of seven planned Venus gravity assists. Parker Solar Probe will break its own distance and speed records on November 21 closest approach, 1.9 million kilometres closer than the previous approach.

The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to study the Sun. With the new solar cycle beginning and a flurry of activities noted in recent weeks on the Sun, studying it has become critical to understanding space weather. Flying into the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, for the first time, Parker Solar Probe will help us in understanding the origins and the evolution of the biggest star in our solar system. Named after Eugene Parker, who gave the concept of the solar wind, the spacecraft performs its scientific investigations in a hazardous region of intense heat and solar radiation. The probe will fly close enough to the Sun to watch the solar wind speed up from subsonic to supersonic and will fly through the birthplace of the highest-energy solar particles.

Instead, it is a space probe going in the other direction, towards the Sun to study it. Back in 2018, NASA's Parker Solar Probe set the record for the fastest human-created object in the universe and then broke it in May this year. This weekend it's set to break it again. Parker's previous speed record was 532,000 kilometers per hour. At that speed, you can get to the Moon and back in about 80 minutes rather than the traditional three-day journey just to get there, but that's still not fast enough for some purposes, so on Sunday, November 21, Parker will up its speed to 587,000 km/h. That's 163 kilometers per second. That's not the fastest Parker will ever move. Barring an unfortunate encounter with a space rock, Parker will eventually achieve a speed of 692,000 km/h in December 2024. As the Michelson-Morely experiment proved, and Einstein explained, there is no universal cosmic still point, so speed is only meaningful relative to something. Parker's speeds are measured relative to the Sun, not Earth. This will be the 10th flyby of the Sun by the probe, as it gets closer to the object of its affection. The increase of speed over time comes as the probe travels an elongated orbit, making short forays as close as 6 million kilometers from the Sun, before hightailing it back out to cool off. In order to get closer to the Sun, Parker makes close approaches to planets to use their gravity to propel itself into orbits that can take it even closer to the Sun, and therefore faster. Last month it made its fifth flyby of Venus to obtain its current orbit. It will make two more major orbital adjustments before its mission is complete. Setting speed records might be cool, but it's just a side-effect of the mission to learn about the Sun, and its immediate surrounds.\"We're observing higher than expected amounts of dust near the Sun,\" Dr Nour Raouafi of Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Labs said in a statement.

As impressive as these speeds are, Parker's peak will be 0.064 percent of the speed of light. Even if it could somehow maintain that maximum on an outward journey it would take 6,700 years to reach the nearest star. You can see why we need something different.

It may have passed through again in August, but that data hasn't yet been fully analysed. Until the probe entered the region, researchers weren't sure exactly how far from the sun the Alfv\u00e9n critical surface would be or what it would be like, but they knew that its presence could be measured by changes in the magnetic field and a slowing of the solar wind below the surface. The Parker Solar Probe's measurements confirmed this, and demonstrated that the critical surface wasn't a smooth bubble around the sun, but rather a wrinkled edge. Studying this surface could help us understand how the sun spits out charged particles that can pose issues for satellites and space explorers, and maybe even predict those outbursts. It is also a step towards understanding other stars beyond our solar system. \"These are stellar phenomena, not just solar phenomena,\" said Parker Solar Probe team member Kelly Korreck during the press conference. The probe is planned to continue circling ever closer to the sun well into 2025, repeatedly breaking its own records for the fastest-moving spacecraft and the closest spacecraft to the sun. Now that we have touched the star, researchers will keep working to unravel its many mysteries.

The Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018 and set out to circle closer and closer to the sun. Scientists, including the spacecraft's namesake astrophysicist Eugene Parker, want to answer fundamental questions about the solar wind that streams out from the sun, flinging energetic particles across the solar system. The sun's corona is much hotter than the actual surface of the star, and the spacecraft could provide insight about why. The corona is one million degrees Kelvin at its hottest point, while the surface is around 6,000 Kelvin. The spacecraft has already revealed surprising finds about the sun, including the 2019 discovery of magnetic zig-zag structures in the solar wind called switchbacks. Now, thanks to Parker's latest close approach to the sun, the spacecraft helped scientists determine that these switchbacks originate from the solar surface. Before Parker Solar Probe's mission is done, it will have made 21 close approaches to the sun over the course of seven years. The probe will orbit within 3.9 million miles of the sun's surface in 2024, closer to the star than Mercury -- the closest planet to the sun. Although that sounds far, researchers equate this to the probe sitting on the four-yard line of a football field and the sun being the end zone. When closest to the sun, the 4-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shields will have to withstand temperatures close to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the inside of the spacecraft and its instruments will remain at a comfortable room temperature. \"Flying so close to the Sun, Parker Solar Probe now senses conditions in the magnetically dominated layer of the solar atmosphere -- the corona -- that we never could before,\" said Nour Raouafi, Parker project scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, in a statement. \"We see evidence of being in the corona in magnetic field data, solar wind data, and visually in images. We can actually see the spacecraft flying through coronal structures that can be observed during a total solar eclipse.\" In April, the Parker team realized their spacecraft had crossed the boundary and entered the solar atmosphere for the first time. It occurred when the spacecraft made its eighth flyby of the sun and registered magnetic and particle conditions specific to a boundary where the sun's massive solar atmosphere ends and the solar wind begins -- 8.1 million miles above the surface of the sun. \"We were fully expecting that, sooner or later, we would encounter the corona for at least a short duration of time,\" said Justin Kasper, lead study author, University of Michigan professor and deputy chief technology officer at BWX Technologies, Inc. in a statement. \"It is very exciting that we've already reached it.\" Parker wove in and out of the corona several times over the course of a few hours during the April flyby, which helped researchers understand that the boundary, called the Alfv\u00e9n critical surface, isn't a smooth circle around the sun. Instead, it has has spikes and valleys. Understanding the presence of these features could allow scientists to match them with solar activity from the sun's surface. During the flyby, Parker made another intriguing encounter as it passed 6.5 million miles from the sun's surface. It passed through a feature called a pseudostreamer, a large structure rising above the surface of the sun that has been observed from Earth during solar eclipses. When the spacecraft flew through the pseudostreamer, things were quiet, just like in the eye of a storm. Typically, Parker is bombarded with particles as it flies through the solar wind. In this case, particles moved slower and the zig-zagging switchbacks decreased. The spacecraft will likely fly through the corona again in January during its next flyby. \"I'm excited to see what Parker finds as it repeatedly passes through the corona in the years to come,\" said Nicola Fox, division director for NASA's Heliophysics Division, in a statement. \"The opportunity for new discoveries is boundless.\" Parker is likely to be in the right place at the right time during future flybys as the sun's 11-year cycle heats up with activity over the next few years. Every 11 years, the sun completes a solar cycle of calm and stormy activity and begins a new one. It's important to understand the solar cycle because space weather caused by the sun -- eruptions like solar flares and coronal mass ejection events -- can impact the power grid, satellites, GPS, airlines, rockets and astronauts in space. The newest solar cycle, which began in December 2019, has been predicted to peak in July 2025, which means an increase in solar activity. This means that the outer edge of the sun's corona will expand and Parker will likely get to spend more time flying through the sun's mysterious outer atmosphere. \"It is a really important region to get into because we think all sorts of physics potentially turn on,\" Kasper said. \"And now we're getting into that region and hopefully going to start seeing some of these physics and behaviors.\" ", "url": "https://abc7chicago.com/spacecraft-touches-sun-parker-solar-probe-nasa-temperature/11358416/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Space Probe Unexpectedly Glimpses The Surface of Venus In Stunning New First", "date": "2022-02-10", "content": "New images recorded by NASA's Parker Solar Probe have revealed the red-hot glow of Venus 's surface radiating through its shroud of toxic clouds - a finding that could help us better understand the minerals making up this rocky and mysterious planet. Using data from the Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe ) instrument, scientists were able to peer beneath the planet's thick atmosphere, discovering geological features such as highlands, plateaus, and plains. \"Venus is the third brightest thing in the sky, but until recently we have not had much information on what the surface looked like because our view of it is blocked by a thick atmosphere,\" says astrophysicist and WISPR team member Brian Wood of the US Naval Research Laboratory. \"Now, we finally are seeing the surface in visible wavelengths for the first time from space.\" Although relatively close to Earth, Venus has proven very difficult to study. It's known as Earth's \" evil twin \", because, while similar to Earth in size, mass, structure, and composition, it's deeply hostile to life. Earth is temperate and wet; Venus is dry and possibly volcanic, with surface temperatures averaging 471 degrees Celsius. Venus's sky is filled with thick, toxic clouds that rain sulfuric acid. These features make the planet difficult to investigate up close. Landers have been sent; they kind of end up melting. And those suffocating clouds make external observations of the surface, not impossible, but tricky. This is where WISPR ended up surprising scientists. Last year, it took some images of Venus 's night side that seemed to show surface features through the cloud layers. \"The images and video just blew me away,\" Wood says. WISPR is optimized for visible light; that is, it takes images in wavelengths that the human eye can see. But it turned out that the instrument can also see a little bit further, into the near-infrared part of the spectrum invisible to human eyes. Infrared and near-infrared are the wavelengths of thermal energy; in other words, heat. On Venus' day side, warmed by the Sun, any infrared emissions from the surface would be lost. But on the night side, it seems temperature variations on the planet's surface are unexpectedly detectable by the instrument. \"It's so hot that the rocky surface of Venus is visibly glowing, like a piece of iron pulled from a forge,\" Wood explains. Other technologies, such as radar imaging conducted by the Magellan probe in the 1990s, and infrared imaging conducted by the current JAXA Akatsuki probe, have given us a pretty good map of Venus' surface geology. WISPR's contribution, the researchers say, brings our understanding right to the very edge of the visible spectrum. The flyby last year revealed a region called the Aphrodite Terra, the largest highland region on the surface of the planet. It showed up as a dark smudge against the luminous clouds. This is because the Aphrodite Terra, with its higher altitude, is a lot cooler than the surrounding terrain, so in infrared or near-infrared images of the planet, it's visible. Those images show other features, too. The Tellus Regio plateau and the Aino Planitia plains also feature variations in altitude that make them visible through the clouds in infrared wavelengths. Although the images haven't revealed anything new in terms of topography, the data can still help us better understand Venus. Because different minerals conduct and release heat differently, the emissions can be used to try to reconstruct the planet's surface mineralogy. This, in turn, can help us understand its history. We know, for example, that Venus has been highly volcanically active in the past. Studying its surface can help us understand how widespread, and how recent, that activity was. Adding visible and near-infrared data to the currently available dataset expands the range of wavelengths scientists can use to do this. Parker's primary objective is to explore the Sun; its Venus observations are almost incidental. The probe is using the planet to make gravity assist maneuvers, using Venus's gravity to make velocity and course adjustments on its solar mission. It's scheduled to make seven of these maneuvers in total; so far it has made five. Only two of those have been suitable for these night- side images so far. Of the two remaining gravity assists, only one will allow for more observations: the final gravity assist, scheduled for 6 November 2024. We'll be fascinated to see what else WISPR might find. \"We're thrilled with the science insights Parker Solar Probe has provided thus far,\" says physicist Nicola Fox of NASA's Heliophysics Division. \"Parker continues to outperform our expectations, and we are excited that these novel observations taken during our gravity assist maneuver can help advance Venus research in unexpected ways.\" The research has been published in Geophysical Research Letters.

As NASA reported, its surface is rusty, smothered in thick clouds. Using its Wide-Field Imager, or WISPR, Parker Solar Probe has captured its first visible-light images of Venus's surface. The images revealed a faint glow from the surface, showing distinctive features like continental regions, plains, and plateaus. It also offers a glowing halo of oxygen in the atmosphere surrounding the planet. As NASA reported, these first visible-light images of Venus's surface can help scientists understand more about Venus's surface geology. It also helps them know minerals might be present there and the planet's evolution. Nicola Fox, division director for the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters, said, \"We're thrilled with the science insights Parker Solar Probe has provided thus far. Parker continues to outperform our expectations, and we are excited that these novel observations taken during our gravity assist maneuver can help advance Venus research in unexpected ways.\" The probe captured the first images in July 2020 during its third flyby. Besides seeing through the clouds, the probe also peers through the surface of the planet. The images were so striking that the scientists turned on the cameras again during the fourth flyby in February 2021. As it passed by Venus, WISPR picked up a range of wavelengths from 470 nanometers to 800 nanometers. Some light is near-infrared - wavelengths that can not be seen but sense as heat, whereas some light, is in the visible range. Wood said, \"The surface of Venus, even on the nightside, is about 860 degrees. It's so hot that the rocky surface of Venus is visibly glowing, like a piece of iron pulled from a forge.\" The WISPR images show features on the Venusian surface, such as the continental region Aphrodite Terra, the Tellus Regio plateau, and the Aino Planitia plains. Since higher altitude regions are around 85 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than lower regions, they appear as dark patches amidst the brighter lowlands. Scientists combined these first images with previous ones. By doing so, they obtained a wider range of wavelengths to study. This could help them identify the mineralogy on the planet's surface. Along with glowing surfaces, the images show a bright ring around the planet's edge caused by oxygen atoms emitting light in the atmosphere. This type of light is known as airglow. WISPR has also imaged Venus' orbital dust ring. On the other side, the FIELDS instrument measured the radio waves in the Venusian atmosphere. This measurement is expected to help scientists understand how the upper atmosphere changes during the Sun's 11-year cycle of activity. Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters, said, \"By studying the surface and atmosphere of Venus, we hope the upcoming missions will help scientists understand the evolution of Venus and what was responsible for making Venus inhospitable today. While both DAVINCI and VERITAS will use primarily near-infrared imaging, Parker's results have shown the value of imaging a wide range of wavelengths.\" ", "url": "https://www.techexplorist.com/nasa-parker-solar-probe-first-visible-light-images-venus-surface/44642/"}, {"title": "NASA's Parker Solar Probe has captured the first visible-light images of Venus", "date": "2022-02-10", "content": "In between its main mission, the Parker Solar Probe just made a novel contribution to Venusian science. New images from the sun-focused mission, captured during a close flyby of Venus, show the planet in visible light for the first time. With time and analysis, the new images will provide valuable information about the planet's geology and minerals, NASA said. \"By combining the new images with previous ones, scientists now have a wider range of wavelengths to study, which can help identify what minerals are on the surface of the planet,\" the agency said in a statement Wednesday. \"Such techniques have previously been used to study the surface of the moon,\" NASA continued. \"Future missions will continue to expand this range of wavelengths, which will contribute to our understanding of habitable planets.\" The Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe imaged the entire night side of the planet in visible light as well as infrared light, revealing regions including continents, plains and plateaus on the lava-soaked planet. Additionally, scientists spotted oxygen in Venus' atmosphere forming a halo around the planet. Seeing the surface in visible light is no small feat, given that Venus is permanently shrouded by clouds. But it's not the first time WISPR took images of the planet, as it did so previously during a July 2020 flyby of Venus. WISPR is designed to look at faint features on the sun and to pick up subtleties in the constant stream of particles flowing from the sun - known as the solar wind. It turns out these capabilities work well on Venus, not only showing its cloud tops but even peeking through to the surface, NASA said. \"Clouds obstruct most of the visible light coming from Venus' surface, but the very longest visible wavelengths, which border the near-infrared wavelengths, make it through,\" the agency explained. While the red light mostly gets lost in daylight pictures, the hope was that a nighttime pass would allow WISPR to see the heat of Venus glowing from the surface. That chance came with a February 2021 flyby, the mission's fourth flyby of Venus, when the spacecraft passed by the planet's nightside for the first time. \"The surface of Venus, even on the nightside, is about 860 degrees Fahrenheit 460 degrees Celsius ,\" lead author Brian Wood, a physicist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, said in the NASA statement. \"It's so hot that the rocky surface of Venus is visibly glowing, like a piece of iron pulled from a forge.\" WISPR picked up wavelengths ranging from the near-infrared to the visible, between 470 nanometers and 800 nanometers. This work is distinctive from previous orbiting missions, which relied upon radar and infrared observations to look at the surface of the planet. Notable past mapping efforts including the Soviet Venera 9 landing mission of 1975, NASA's Magellan mission that gathered the first planetary maps from orbit in the 1990s using radar wavelengths, and Japan's Akatsuki infrared images since reaching orbit around Venus in 2016. WISPR's new images of areas such as the continental region Aphrodite Terra, the Tellus Regio plateau, and the Aino Planitia plains can be compared with these other mission images to gain more insights into the planet's history, NASA stated. Since Earth and Venus are both rocky planets, such studies may also help inform our understanding of rocky planet evolution more generally.

Launched in August 2018, this small car-sized probe is revolutionising our understanding of the Sun. It's the first human-made object to touch the Sun by travelling directly through the Sun's atmosphere. Now, the Parker has achieved another feat, capturing some stunning images of Venus, with details like never before. As per NASA, these are the first visible-light images of the Venusian surface! Venus supports extremely hot conditions, boiling at over 471\u00b0C, with toxic clouds pelting sulfuric acid rain on its surface. Scientists have always been curious about what turned Venus into an inhospitable place despite its similarities with the Earth in terms of size, mass, and structure. Venus is usually shrouded with thick clouds, making it highly challenging for the spacecraft to peer beneath its atmosphere. Space agencies have also sent landers to Venus, but they barely survived for a few hours in such a super- hostile world. \"Venus is the third brightest thing in the sky, but until recently, we have not had much information on what the surface looked like because our view of it is blocked by a thick atmosphere. Now, we finally are seeing the surface in visible wavelengths for the first time from space,\" said Brian Wood, lead author and physicist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, in an official statement. The credit belongs to the spacecraft's Wide-Field Imager or WISPR, which managed to capture surface features of the planet's nightside. Parker took these striking images during different flybys, with the first glimpse in July 2020 and another in February 2021. The spacecraft's orbit was perfectly aligned with Venus' nightside in the latter flyby. WISPR imaged in the visible spectrum wavelength-the light that the human eye can perceive. Thick clouds on Venus usually blanket most of the visible light coming from its surface. \"We're thrilled with the science insights Parker Solar Probe has provided thus far. Parker continues to outperform our expectations, and we are excited that these novel observations taken during our gravity assist manoeuvre can help advance Venus research in unexpected ways,\" said Nicola Fox, division director for the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters. Parker managed to one step ahead and captured the longest visible wavelengths-into the near-infrared spectrum-on the nightside. Otherwise, the wavelength is not detectable on the dayside due to the bright sunshine reflected off Venus' cloud tops. NASA reveals that the imager was particularly designed to detect faint glow in the solar atmosphere and wind. However, scientists hoped that they could also use it to image clouds of Venus as well to some degree. And indeed, the results turned out to be pretty good! The images showcase prominent features of Venus like the continental region Aphrodite Terra, the Tellus Regio plateau, and the Aino Planitia plains. NASA says these images would help scientists understand Venus better, especially its surface geology, presence of various minerals, and even how the planet evolved to its present state.

The flyby is crucial as the probe will approach the Sun towards the Earth-facing side and will provide unique opportunities for future missions towards the brightest star in our solar system. The February 25 close approach will bring the spacecraft within 85,29,523 kilometers from our star. Nasa said that Parker is learning more about our star with its science instruments as it gets closer than ever before. The probe is hurtling towards the Sun at a speed of 3,592 kilometers per hour. \"During this close approach, Parker Solar Probe passes the Suns Earth-facing side.

This will be the 11th flyby out of the 24 orbits planned for the probe around the Sun, including seven gravity assists from Venus. The Parker Solar Probe, named after Eugene Parker, who gave the concept of solar wind, will provide data about solar activity and study the mysterious corona. The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to study the Sun. With the new solar cycle beginning and a flurry of activities noted in recent weeks on the Sun, studying it has become critical to understanding space weather. Nasa said that at the closest approach, Parker Solar Probe will be hurtling around the Sun at approximately 6,92,017 kilometers per hour. In the final three of the 24 orbits around the Sun, the probe will go as close as nine solar radii to the Sun's surface, which is nine times the radius of the Sun, or about 61,63,787 kilometers. In December last year, the Parker Solar Probe became the first human-made object to venture into the Sun's atmosphere, known as the corona. During the flyby, the spacecraft sampled particles and magnetic fields emerging from the Sun. The spacecraft and instruments are being protected from the Suns heat by a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite shield, which can withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft that reach nearly 1,377 degrees Celsius. \"At closest approach to the Sun, while the front of Parker Solar Probe's solar shield faces temperatures approaching 1,400 degrees Celsius, the spacecraft's payload will be near room temperature, at about 29 degrees Celcius,\" Nasa said.

The plucky spacecraft, heavily shielded against the sun's radiation and extreme heat, will dip to within 5.3 million miles of the solar surface on Friday. That's about 14 times closer than the orbit of Mercury, our closest planet to the sun. The exact time of the closest approach, known as perihelion, will be 10:36 a.m. EST, according to a spokesperson at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which oversees the mission. At closest approach, the spacecraft will be flying at about 364,660 mph ; Parker Solar Probe has held the speed record for fastest spacecraft since 2018, a couple of months after its launch. By the end of its mission, the spacecraft will be send home data from within just 3.83 million miles of the sun's surface. Getting that close to the sun will allow scientists to continue making observations about the solar environment, particularly the atmosphere, which scientists call the corona. The incredibly hot corona is millions of degrees hotter than the surface, regardless of the scale of temperature used, and it's not quite clear yet how this huge jump in temperatures happens. Parker Solar Probe launched in August 2018 to study the sun's outer atmosphere and includes four different instrument suites to learn more about how the corona works, and how it affects space weather near our planet. Space weather can affect our planet in numerous ways, especially when coronal mass ejections of charged particles from our sun hit infrastructure such as power lines or satellites. These events, however, also can produce colorful displays high in up in our atmosphere called auroras. While doing solar science, Parker is also performing flybys of other planets to pick up speed and to do some side science observations. An example includes visible-light pictures of Venus that the probe captured, released earlier in February.

Occurring at 10:36 a.m. EST on February 25, this was the 11th close approach - or perihelion in the spacecraft's orbit around the Sun - of 24 planned for Parker Solar Probe's primary mission. Most of these passes occur while the Sun is between the spacecraft and Earth, blocking any direct lines of sight from home. But every few orbits, the dynamics work out to put the spacecraft in Earth's view - and the Parker mission team seizes these opportunities to organize broad observation campaigns that not only include telescopes on Earth, but several spacecraft as well. More than 40 observatories around the globe, including the recently commissioned Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii, among other major installations in the southwestern United States, Europe and Asia, are training their visible, infrared and radio telescopes on the Sun over the several weeks around the perihelion. About a dozen spacecraft, including NASA's STEREO, Solar Dynamics Observatory, TIMED, and Magnetospheric Multiscale missions, ESA's and NASA's Solar Orbiter, ESA's BepiColombo, the JAXA-led Hinode, and even NASA's MAVEN at Mars are making simultaneous observations of activity stretching from the Sun to Earth and beyond. The pass also marked the midway point in the mission's 11th solar encounter, which began February 20 and continues through March 2. The spacecraft checked in with mission operators at APL - where Parker Solar Probe was designed and built - on February 28 to report that it was healthy and operating as expected.

Both NASA and the University of Chicago, where Parker had worked for decades, announced his death. \"We were saddened to learn the news that one of the great scientific minds and leaders of our time has passed,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in an agency statement. \"Dr. Eugene Parker's contributions to science and to understanding how our universe works touches so much of what we do here at NASA,\" he added. \"Dr. Parker's legacy will live on, through the many active and future NASA missions that build upon his work.\" NASA's Parker Solar Probe launched in August 2018 to study the sun's outer atmosphere, called the corona, by diving within 4 million miles of the visible surface of the sun. The spacecraft uses four instrument suites to study the superheated corona in an attempt to understand where the solar wind originates. The mission is expected to continue observations until 2025. The mission, originally dubbed Solar Probe+, was named for Parker in 2017, making him the first living scientist to see a spacecraft named in his honor. Parker himself attended the launch, his first ever. \"Anyone who knew Dr. Parker, knew that he was a visionary,\" Nicola Fox, director of NASA's heliophysics division, said in the agency statement. \"I was honored to stand with him at the launch of Parker Solar Probe and have loved getting to share with him all the exciting science results, seeing his face light up with every new image and data plot I showed him. I will sincerely miss his excitement and love for Parker Solar Probe. Even though Dr. Parker is no longer with us, his discoveries and legacy will live forever.\" Parker was born in 1927 in Houghton, Michigan, and completed an undergraduate degree in physics from Michigan State University in 1948 and a Ph.D. at the California Institute of Technology in 1951. He first worked as an instructor and assistant professor at the University of Utah. In 1955, Parker joined the University of Chicago, where he contributed to astrophysics for another 67 years, according to the university's statement. Two years after his appointment, he realized the superheated corona of the sun should, in theory, create charged particles leaving the sun's surface at high speed. Other scientists didn't believe him, Parker recalled in 2018. \"The first reviewer on the paper said, 'Well I would suggest that Parker go to the library and read up on the subject before he tries to write a paper about it, because this is utter nonsense.'\" Support at last came from a colleague of Parker's at the university, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar - who himself, decades later became the namesake of NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. While the future Nobel Prize winner wasn't a fan of the particle idea, Chandrasekhar accepted Parker's paper because he could not find problems with Parker's mathematics, the University of Chicago said. It only took a few more years before Parker's proof came through. In 1962, NASA's Mariner 2 spacecraft discovered the solar wind during its voyage to Venus. In the following decades, Parker expanded his research to examine cosmic rays, galactic magnetic fields, and other topics in astrophysics. As a result of his broad interests, a range of scientific concepts are named for him. \"His name is littered across astrophysics: the Parker instability, which describes magnetic fields in galaxies; the Parker equation, which describes particles moving through plasmas; the Sweet-Parker model of magnetic fields in plasmas; and the Parker limit on the flux of magnetic monopoles,\" the university wrote of Parker. Parker was also chair twice over for both the university's astronomy and astrophysics department, as well as the astronomy section of the National Academy of Sciences. He retired in 1995, but remained active in the field of astrophysics until shortly before his death. \"Gene represented to me the ideal physicist - brilliant and accomplished, personable, articulate, but also humble,\" Robert Rosner, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago and a longtime colleague of Parker's, said in the university statement. \"I will never forget the pleasure he took in exploring a science problem, and his terrific physical insights which were then buttressed by his analytical skills,\" Rosner added. \"And one can never forget the encouragement he gave to everyone he interacted with - his own students and postdocs, and his colleagues. His passing indeed marks a great loss for us all.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/eugene-parker-solar-probe-scientist-dead"}, {"title": "The Sun's Puzzling Heating Problem Is Closer to Being Solved", "date": "2022-03-24", "content": "At 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the sun's surface seems like it would be one of the hottest places in our solar system. But in the outermost layer of its atmosphere called the corona, temperatures can reach 100 times higher. Why? That's a mystery that has puzzled scientists for decades. It's known as the coronal heating problem. Using a supercomputer, astrophysicists have been able to reconcile two of the major theories for the corona's extreme heat and show they match up neatly with observations taken by NASA's Parker Solar Probe, a tiny robot that recently became the first spacecraft to \"touch the sun.\" Their study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Astronomy, uses a six- dimensional simulation of a small patch of the sun's corona to analyze how particles are heated up and how they interact with the mammoth furnace's magnetic fields. \"What is nice about our result is that it links together two previous theories that had each been very well studied,\" said Jonathan Squire, an astrophysicist at the University of Otago in New Zealand. The theories revolve around \"turbulence,\" which heats up the corona by transferring energy from close to the sun outward, and a type of magnetic wave known as \"ion cyclotron waves.\" The theories both have holes that don't line up with observations made by spacecraft and telescopes. They struggle to explain how the corona can get so hot on their own. So Squire and his co-authors basically shrugged their shoulders and asked: \"Well, why don't we have both?\" The computer simulations they performed show that turbulence drives the ion cyclotron waves, \"which effectively keeps the \"good bits\" of both of the theories individually,\" according to Squire. Though the team didn't directly use data from NASA's Solar Probe in this paper, it did provide a point of comparison and its data seemed to match what the sun simulation spat out, giving the researchers confidence in their simulations. This doesn't necessarily mean the \"coronal heating problem\" is solved, but Squire said the team has made important progress in understanding the phenomenon. He points out that \"there may be multiple different mechanisms operating in different parts of the sun\" and different mechanisms could be heating the corona in different ways. While all this seems like a problem that's 100 million miles away from home, the corona -- and the solar wind that blasts out of the sun -- can wreak havoc on Earth. They send particles blazing across space that can cause geomagnetic storms, messing with our planet's magnetic field and disrupting satellites. In early February, a batch of recently launched SpaceX Starlink satellites were doomed after a geomagnetic storm hit them just after launch, preventing the broadband satellites from reaching their desired orbit. They eventually came crashing back to Earth, burning up in the atmosphere. Squire said the reason those storms are so violent must be related to the ways in which the corona and solar wind heats up. Indirectly, turbulence and ion cyclotron waves might one day take out your internet -- unless we can see them coming. \"In order to have better predictions for space weather and geomagnetic storms,\" Squire said, \"we have to understand more about how the corona works.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/space/the-suns-puzzling-heating-problem-is-closer-to-being-solved/"}, {"title": "NASA's sun-grazing Parker Solar Probe will zip through its 12th stellar closeup today", "date": "2022-06-01", "content": "NASA's sun-grazing spacecraft will make its 12th close flyby of our star on Wednesday, marking the halfway point of the mission. During this flyby, the Parker Solar Probe, which is specially designed to take the extreme solar heat and radiation, will get as close as 5.3 million miles of the solar surface, which is about as near as it drew during the last close approach on Feb. 25. Flying 14 times closer than the orbit of Mercury - our solar system's closest planet to the sun - Parker will reach a top speed of 364,660 mph. That's roughly 21 times faster than the International Space Station's speed as it orbits Earth. The exact time of the closest approach, known as perihelion, will be 6:50 p.m. EDT, according to a spokesperson at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which oversees the mission. Parker isn't set to break its speed record again this time, as it has several times throughout its mission. But what's more valuable that superlatives is how so many close passes are providing information about the sun's complex behavior, which leads to phenomena such as superheating the million-degree corona that is much hotter than the plasma on the sun's surface. \"The Parker Solar Probe mission is not only reshaping the landscape of solar and heliophysics research before our eyes, but it is enticing us to pursue challenging ideas that, just a few years ago, we considered out of reach,\" Nour Raouafi, the mission's project scientist from JHUAPL, said in a recent statement. The mission has crossed the Alfv\u00e9n critical surface now numerous times, for example. That's where solar material leaves the surface and becomes the solar wind, a critical radiation vector that affects space weather all over the solar system. Scientists now know that the boundary is wrinkled, rather than a smooth curve. \"Sampling the solar wind below the Alfv\u00e9n critical boundary is essential to understanding the heating and acceleration of the solar wind,\" stated BWX Technologies' Justin Kasper, principal investigator for Parker's Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons instrument. Some of Parker's other discoveries include finding a dust-free area around the sun where the grains sublimate due to extreme heat, determining the origin of magnetic field \"switchbacks\" at magnetic \"funnels\" in the solar surface, and better understanding the nature of solar energetic particles. The mission is expected to better uncover the nature of space weather, which can affect our planet by shorting out satellites, power lines or other infrastructure during the most powerful storms. More usually, however, the events are harmless and produce colorful displays high in up in our atmosphere called auroras. Parker Solar Probe launched in August 2018 and includes four different instrument suites. It also does periodic planetary flybys of Venus to pick up speed or adjust course, sometimes nabbing stunning images along the way. The next such flyby will occur in August 2023. All told, the Parker Solar Probe is expected to make 24 close passes of the sun during its seven-year mission, which is scheduled to wrap up in mid-2025.

Launched in August 2018 the spacecraft keeps breaking its own records for speed and proximity to our local star. This time it got to within five million miles of the sun's surface. At first glance this seems ridiculously far off, so let's put that feat into perspective for the wonder it truly deserves. Our sun is a gigantic ball of self-sustaining nuclear fusion. Every second it converts unimaginable amounts of hydrogen into helium, releasing mind-boggling amounts of energy in the process. It is this energy that powers all life on Planet Earth: it provides us with heat and light, and a gravitational center to stick to, lest we'd be flung into the vast empty cold of space. It's a pretty run-of-the-mill star, quite average in every way when compared to the other stars out there. And yet, so many mysteries remain. It's weird to consider that the sun has an atmosphere. We tend to think of an atmosphere as some air-like gas, something you can breathe. Compared to Earth's thin blue line that the astronauts on board the International Space Station see, the sun's atmosphere is huge - this is the brightly glowing corona we can spot during a total solar eclipse. While the sun's surface is a mere 6000F the corona clocks in at over a million degrees, so the further away you get from the sun's surface the hotter it gets! Parker is gathering data to help unravel the mystery of the crazy hot solar atmosphere. To do so it needs to dive right in there! Granted, nothing human- made can withstand such insanely high temperatures, and while Parker is equipped with the Mother of all Heatshields it also zips through the point of closest approach at blistering speeds - pun fully intended - in order to emerge unscathed on the other side. It folds its diminutive solar panels close to its body, points its heatshield at the sun and goes for it. At 364,660 mph this close approach is a calculated risk, and the closer it gets with each flyby the faster it will go. There are 12 more close encounters planned, nudging a little closer and going a little faster every so often. The spacecraft's data has already led to a number of fascinating discoveries, such as the nature of the sun's complicated magnetic field, or finding a dust- free zone since literally anything left there for too long gets vaporized. Parker is also examining the material flung out by the sun which then travels long distances as the so-called solar wind, the effects of which we can see on Earth as the Northern Lights for example. The site also includes a neat countdown timer to the next mission milestone. In order to achieve its ever-tightening orbits around the sun the spacecraft makes the occasional flyby of the planet Venus, steals a teensy bit of the planet's momentum to fling itself onto different trajectories and grabbing some gorgeous views in passing. As pretty as Venus may look in the morning or evening sky, it is a hellish place for sure, with surface temperatures that melt lead and crushing atmospheric pressures. There's a certain elegance in Parker's journey to visit two such hot places repeatedly! However, solar science is not just for super-tough spacecraft. In fact - you - can be a solar scientist as well, working in your comfy air- conditioned home at your computer or smartphone! And so maybe you want to consider becoming a citizen scientist today! What's stopping you? There are currently two projects listed which you can do here in central Georgia, the Solar Jet Hunter and the Sun Grazer Project. Both allow you to do actual science alongside professional researchers by looking for indicators of comets or those puzzling jets of plasma. Signing up is easy and you work at your own pace. Get the whole family involved to maximize your output! When it's just too hot to do anything outside, chilling at home with some solar science is the way to go. Sadly, Eugene Parker, the namesake of the Parker Solar Probe passed away three months ago, but his legacy lives on in so many ways: from the death-defying spacecraft to the Milledgeville citizen scientist lounging on the couch while scrutinizing images for clues!

In 1975, the Soviet Venera 9 and 10 probes returned our first-ever pictures of the surface of Venus. These were followed by images from the Venera 13 and 14 probes in 1982. In the decades since, we've only seen views of the cloud tops, or very specialized radar or infrared images of the surface terrain. Now, NASA's Parker Solar Probe has given us a new look, as its highly- sensitive WISPR cameras captured the surface glowing through the layers of cloud. \"The surface of Venus, even on the nightside, is about 860 degrees Fahrenheit ,\" Naval Research Laboratory physicist Brian Wood said in a NASA press release. Wood is the lead author of a new study published this week that analyzed PSP's flyby images of Venus. For reference, 860\u00b0F is 475\u00b0C. \"It's so hot that the rocky surface of Venus is visibly glowing, like a piece of iron pulled from a forge,\" Wood said. When the WISPR cameras on the spacecraft were designed, planetary imaging wasn't exactly on the team's mind. These cameras were specifically built to capture imagery of the Sun's corona and the solar wind. So, the first glimpse the cameras gave of the surface of Venus, above, was an unexpected bonus. The mission team was only hoping for a close-up look at the planet's cloud tops as the spacecraft sped by. Instead, they got much more. According to NASA: \"Clouds obstruct most of the visible light coming from Venus' surface, but the very longest visible wavelengths, which border the near-infrared wavelengths, make it through. On the dayside, this red light gets lost amid the bright sunshine reflected off Venus' cloud tops, but in the darkness of night, the WISPR cameras were able to pick up this faint glow caused by the incredible heat emanating from the surface.\"* When PSP made its next Venus flyby, in February 2021, the team was ready, instructing the spacecraft to take multiple images as it zoomed past the planet. Watch below: Venus' surface glows through its cloud layers on Parker Solar Probe's fourth flyby \"Venus is the third brightest thing in the sky, but until recently we have not had much information on what the surface looked like because our view of it is blocked by a thick atmosphere,\" Wood said. \"Now, we finally are seeing the surface in visible wavelengths for the first time from space.\" Parker Solar Probe's mission is to investigate the Sun and the solar wind. In the process of its mission, the spacecraft draws closer and closer to the Sun, and the method it uses for this is to fly past Venus for a little extra 'kick' from the planet's gravity. As of now, in February 2022, PSP has made five Venus flybys. It is due for at least two more before the expected end of the mission - one in August 2023 and another in November 2024. Further images captured by WISPR during those encounters could provide us with even more knowledge about Earth's sister planet. NASA said that since different minerals glow in different wavelengths of light when heated, these WISPR images and those taken in the future could help scientists plot a more detailed map of the geology of Venus. \"We're thrilled with the science insights Parker Solar Probe has provided thus far,\" Nicola Fox, division director for the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters said in the press release. \"Parker continues to outperform our expectations, and we are excited that these novel observations taken during our gravity assist maneuver can help advance Venus research in unexpected ways.\" ", "url": "https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/news/article/parker-solar-probe-saw-the-first-views-of-surface-of-venus-from-space"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Solar Orbiter records a solar switchback proving they exist", "date": "2022-09-30", "content": "The ESA described its new observation as the \"first evidence of a switchback in the solar corona\".

NASA's Parker Solar Probe, for example, detected abrupt reversals in the sun's magnetic field, though it did not capture any imagery. The ESA's Solar Orbiter probe was designed to take the most close-up images of the sun and collect data on its magnetic field. The probe observed the S-shaped structure, known as a switchback, in the solar plasma in March this year. The observation was published, alongside a new study, on Monday, September 12, in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. NASA's Parker Solar Probe makes the closest approach any spacecraft has made to the sun, orbiting at distances within just a few million miles of the star's surface. Solar Orbiter keeps its distance by comparison. Orbiting a little further from the sun has the benefit of allowing the Solar Orbiter to equip and use imaging instruments, which would not be able to survive the closer approaches the Parker Solar Probe makes to the sun. Scientists compared images taken by Solar Orbiter's cameras at different wavelengths and they found that the switchback phenomenon occurred just above an active sunspot - a cooler region of the sun characterized by dense and twisted magnetic fields.

So far, no contact has been made between the space probe and the solar phenomenon. However, its survivability or operational capability is of concern since solar storms are known for disrupting signals. The potential contact came after NASA's Parker Solar Probe came a relatively close distance of 5.3 million miles within the Sun's surface on September 6 at 2:04 a.m. EDT. It is the spacecraft's 13th close approach of the Sun. According to Nour Raouafi, a project scientist at Johns Hopkins University, nobody has ever hovered near a solar event in close proximity with the Sun before, as cited by Space.com. Raouafi managed the mission and works for the university's applied physics laboratory. Parker Solar Probe has yet pass through a solar flare or a coronal mass ejection during its perihelion but its trajectory and contact with a solar storm can change this month, according to a statement by NASA. The US space agency says the spacecraft has approached the Sun amid an increasing solar activity, as part of its Solar Cycle 25, which started its solar minimum in December 2019 and expected its solar maximum by 2025, according to astronomers. The intensity and frequency of solar storms are determined by the phase of the current cycle, where more solar activities are expected during the maximum stage by 2025. This is expected to increase during its 11-year solar cycle. In recent weeks and months, the Sun has emitted enormous solar storms, including solar flares from zombie sunspots, CMEs, and a solar wind. These solar eruptions have generated a variety of space weather hazards, including geomagnetic storms, solar radiation storms, and radio blackouts. These space events have led to disruption of Earth's radio and satellite technology, affecting electronic devices, equipment, and craft dependent on them. In December 2021, the Parker Solar Probe touched the Sun, which was never seen in history. This was made possible when it flown through the Sun's upper atmosphere, the corona, where it collected solar particles and sampled magnetic fields. According to NASA TV, the event is the first of its kind where a spacecraft touched our solar system's only star. It is also considered as a major step in the field of solar science, bringing new discoveries similar to the moon landing which led to the understanding on how our natural satellite was formed. Touching the Sun is a \"monumental moment\" for the field and a truly significant achievement, according to Thomas Zurbuchen, an associate administrator of the Science Mission directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Zurbuchen emphasized the feat offers us novel insights regarding our Sun's evolution and its wide implications in our solar system. In addition, it also influenced everything we learned about the Sun and other stars throughout the universe.

They have also coordinated observation times with Solar Orbiter, an ESA /NASA mission that will view the Sun from the same angle as Parker, but 58.5 million miles farther from the Sun's surface. Parker's observations do not always overlap with those of other observatories, such as Solar Orbiter or Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A, another NASA solar probe. But when they do, it offers significant advantages. \"By combining the data from multiple space missions and even ground observatories, we can understand the bigger picture,\" Raouafi said. \"In this case, with both Parker and Solar Orbiter observing the Sun from different distances, we will be able to study the evolution of the solar wind, gathering data as it passes one spacecraft and then the other.\" This is not the first time Parker and Solar Orbiter have been in alignment for one of Parker's perihelions.

Solar Orbiter, a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency, will observe the sun at the same time as Parker, but from 58.5 million miles away after Solar Orbiter made a flyby of Venus on Saturday. \"By combining the data from multiple space missions and even ground observatories, we can understand the bigger picture,\" Raouafi said. \"In this case, with both Parker and Solar Orbiter observing the sun from different distances, we will be able to study the evolution of the solar wind, gathering data as it passes one spacecraft and then the other.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/parker-solar-probe-13th-sun-flyby"}]}]
