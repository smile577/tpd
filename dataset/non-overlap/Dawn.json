Kepler and INSIDE Jupiter have been submitted to past rounds of the Discovery program, while Dawn appears to be a new proposal. One mission will be selected later this year for full funding, with a September 2006 launch deadline and budget of $299 million. NASA also said Thursday it was funding a \"mission of opportunity\" to provide seismic and wind sensors for the French \"NetLander\" mission, a network of four spacecraft that will land on Mars in 2007.", "url": "https://www.spacetoday.net/Summary/7?id=7"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "'Dawn' Discovery Mission Selected for 2006 Launch", "date": "2001-12-21", "content": "NASA today announced that \"Dawn\" will be one of the two new Discovery missions slated for launch in 2006. The ion-propulsion powered mission will make a nine-year journey to orbit Vesta and Ceres, the two most massive asteroids known. The asteroids, located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, have recorded what the early solar system was like when the terrestrial planets formed. \"This is terrific,\" said University of Arizona astronomer Mark V. Sykes, a scientist on the Dawn mission. \"We've been proposing advanced propulsion technology missions for many years now, and it's great to have an opportunity to actually fly one.\" The Dawn mission is led by Christopher T. Russell of the University of California - Los Angeles. The project is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Orbital Sciences Corp., Dulles, Va., will develop the spacecraft. NASA selected the missions from 26 proposals made in early 2001. The missions must stay within the Discovery Program's development-cost cap of about $299 million. \"Dawn will study the conditions and processes of planet formation during the earliest epoch of our solar system by orbiting and studying Ceres and Vesta,\" Sykes said. Dawn builds on decades of asteroid and meteorite studies, he added. \"Ceres is more than a quarter the diameter of the moon, is water-rich, and has retained its primitive composition and condition. Vesta, on the other hand, was dry, heated to the point of melting, and preserves a record of its subsequent differentiation. \"Almost all asteroids that we observe today are the fragments of larger asteroids like Vesta and Ceres that were destroyed by ancient catastrophic collisions. By studying Vesta and Ceres, we gain a much greater understanding of how these modern fragments were once put together,\" Sykes said. Actually, scientists already have pieces of one of the asteroids within reach - as meteorites that landed on Earth. \"Cratering collisions have knocked off pieces of Vesta, which have been recovered as meteorites. They provide us with detailed information on geochemical processes that have occurred within specific sites on Vesta from the time of its formation at the beginning of the solar system,\" Sykes said. \"Going to Vesta will give us the big picture within which these hand-sized pieces fit. It will be like going from studying bits of hair, nail, and bone to seeing and studying the entire animal up close for the first time,\" he added. Sykes, an associate astronomer at Steward Observatory, specializes in the study of asteroids, comets and interplanetary dust. He is the Chair of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society. Dawn will carry a framing camera and mapping spectrometer provided by the German Aerospace Center, DLR, Institute of Sensor Technology and Planetary Exploration in Berlin; a laser altimeter experiment provided by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in conjunction with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; a gamma ray/neutron spectrometer from the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory; and a magnetometer provided by UCLA. Ion engines will power the spacecraft to the asteroid belt, where it first orbits Vesta in an ever-tightening circle and then spirals outward and heads to its rendezvous with Ceres. The spacecraft will orbit as high as 800 kilometers (500 miles) to as low as 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) above the surface of the asteroids. Flybys of more than a dozen other asteroids along the way are planned. NASA also selected the Kepler mission for 2006 launch. Kepler, a spaceborne telescope, will search for Earth-like planets around stars beyond the solar system. \"Kepler and Dawn are exactly the kind of missions NASA should be launching, missions that tackle some of the most important questions in science yet do it for a very modest cost,\" said Edward Weiler, associate administrator for space science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"It's an indicator of how far we've come in our capability to explore space when missions with such ambitious goals are proposed for the Discovery Program of lower-cost missions rather than as major projects costing ten times as much.\"", "url": "https://news.arizona.edu/story/dawn-discovery-mission-selected-for-2006-launch"}, {"title": "JPL Asteroid Mission Gets Thumbs Up from NASA", "date": "2001-12-21", "content": "A mission that will orbit the two largest asteroids in the solar system is one of a pair of missions chosen by NASA for the agency's Discovery program.

Using the same set of instruments to observe these two bodies, both located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Dawn will improve our understanding of how planets formed during the earliest epoch of the solar system. Ceres has quite a primitive surface, water-bearing minerals, and possibly a very weak atmosphere and frost. Vesta is a dry body that has been resurfaced by basaltic lava flows, and may have an early magma ocean like Earth's Moon. Like the Moon, it has been hit many times by smaller space rocks, and these impacts have sent out meteorites at least five times in the last 50 million years. The mission will determine these pre-planets' physical attributes, such as shape, size, mass, craters and internal structure, and study more complex properties such as composition, density and magnetism. The Dawn mission builds on the highly successful ion-propulsion technology pioneered by NASA's Deep Space 1 spacecraft. During its nine-year journey through the asteroid belt, Dawn will rendezvous with Vesta and Ceres, orbiting from as high as 800 kilometers (500 miles) to as low as 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) above the surface. \"I'm ecstatic that we'll have such a great opportunity to show what ion propulsion can do,\" said JPL's Sarah Gavit, Dawn project manager. \"Ceres and Vesta are two of the largest unexplored worlds in our solar system. We'll learn about early planet formation in ways that wouldn't have been possible before this mission.\" She said she looks forward to working with Orbital Sciences, a new industry partner for NASA's interplanetary spacecraft. Orbital Sciences Corporation, Dulles, Va., will develop the Dawn spacecraft. \"With its cutting-edge capability, Kepler may help us answer one of the most enduring questions humans have asked throughout history: are there others like us in the universe?\" said principal investigator William Borucki of NASA's Ames research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., leader of the second selected mission. The Kepler mission differs from previous ways of looking for planets orbiting other stars. Kepler will look for the 'transit' signature of planets that occurs each time a planet crosses the line-of-sight between the planet's parent star and the observer. When this happens, the planet blocks some of the light from its star, resulting in a periodic dimming. This periodic signature is used to detect the planet and to determine its size and orbit. Kepler will continuously fix its gaze at a region of space containing 100,000 stars and will be able to determine if Earth-sized planets make a transit across any of the stars. The industrial partner for mission hardware development is Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colo. Kepler's selection involves a delayed start of development of up to one year due to funding constraints in the Discovery program. NASA selected these missions from 26 proposals made in early 2001.

The Dawn spacecraft will draw on extensive design heritage and operational experience from Orbital's LEOStar low-orbit satellites and the company's StarBus geosynchronous-orbit platforms. It also will incorporate JPL's solar- electric (ion) propulsion system and deep-space communications link. The spacecraft will weigh about 2,750 pounds (1,245 kilograms) at launch and will generate approximately 8 kilowatts of solar power at Earth's distance from the Sun. The Dawn spacecraft's core structure will measure about six feet (two meters) high, while its solar arrays will span almost 70 feet (21 meters) in length.

Dawn successfully completed the formulation phase in February of 2004 and entered phase C/D or the implementation phase. In phase C/D planning is complete and the ordering of parts and construction of the flight system can begin. Because of increased oversight in the Discovery program, Dawn was required to pass additional reviews and tests before undergoing its Critical Design Review (CDR) in June of this year. The CDR is the last hurdle before the assembly of the flight system. Dawn met or exceeded all of the additional criteria NASA Headquarters had levied and had an extremely successful CDR. Dawn now has an unconditional go ahead to proceed to launch. The next major step in the process after the flight system is assembled is to review preparedness for test, integration and launch operations. This is followed by flight readiness reviews to assure we are ready to operate the spacecraft. The schedule we are following is tight but we are monitoring it carefully and holding to our planned launch in mid June 2006. I am very pleased with our progress to date, and am extremely appreciative of the tremendous efforts expended by the JPL, Orbital and the instrument teams in getting us to where we are today.

Colleen Hartman, NASA deputy associate administrator for science, said the agency expects to complete the review in February and then decide whether and how to proceed with Dawn, a Discovery-class mission that until recently was being readied for a June 2006 launch. Dawn is designed to orbit the solar system's two largest known asteroids over a nine-year period. According to NASA, Dawn is running about 11 percent over its $373 million budget as program officials wrestle with a number of technical problems mostly related to development of the spacecraft's ion propulsion system. NASA successfully demonstrated ion propulsion in 1998 on its Deep Space 1 mission. But Dawn would be NASA's first purely scientific mission to rely exclusively on the highly efficient propulsion technology. Deep Space 1's xenon-ion propulsion system powered the experimental spacecraft for more than three years until NASA finally ended the mission in December 2001. It was during that same month that NASA announced its selection of the Dawn proposal for funding under the Discovery program of cost-capped science missions. Dawn, like Deep Space 1, is being managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Hartman said the ion propulsion system is the primary source of Dawn's technical problems. She said the Dawn team has run into trouble with the engine's power processing unit and is experiencing qualification problems with its xenon propellant tank. It is not clear that the team knows how to solve the problems, she said . At the same time, Hartman said, NASA has concerns about the overall management of the project that it wants to review in depth before going forward. NASA has told the Dawn team to \"stand down\" for three months while separate technical and managerial reviews are conducted. \"When you have these kinds of problems, a stand-down is the most sensible way to go to make sure nothing is done that will do any further harm,\" Hartman said. \"This is just a time to take a look at the systems engineering of Dawn overall to make sure we are confident about the path to closure on all of these things.\" Hartman said the stand-down, while unusual for a mission as close to launch as Dawn, should not be construed as an indication that NASA intends to cancel the mission. \"I have no a priori conclusions,\" she said. \"We have every managerial option we can use at our disposal.\" She also said the order was not meant to send a message that NASA is taking a harder line on cost growth. \"I don't think it's a change in terms of a harder line or not a harder line,\" she said. \"We are very serious about cost containment in these missions. Good systems engineering and good program management are always the things that help us close our programs.\" Dawn's principal investigator, Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles, said he is confident that NASA will decide to go forward with the mission at the conclusion of the reviews. Russell also said Dawn can tolerate a launch delay without jeopardizing the science objectives of the mission. The launch window the Dawn team has been shooting for, he said in a recent interview, is over a year long. Meanwhile, NASA plans to select its next Discovery mission candidates in the year ahead. An announcement of opportunity is due to be released in the coming months. NASA is raising the cost cap on the next round of Discovery missions to $425 million. Hartman said the $75 million increase, the program's first in three years, was overdue. \"Our cost of doing business has increased, particularly for launch vehicles,\" she said.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/technical-management-problems-prompted-delay-dawn-mission/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA Asteroid Mission Won't Launch This Year", "date": "2006-01-21", "content": "A NASA spacecraft built to explore two of the solar system's largest asteroids won't launch this year because the space agency is dealing with cost overruns and technical issues in the project. The planned summer launch of the Dawn spacecraft has been indefinitely postponed, said Andrew Dantzler, director of NASA's solar system division. Mission managers had been ordered to halt work on Dawn last fall while the project was assessed by an independent review team, which is expected to present its findings to NASA on Jan. 27. Even if NASA gives Dawn the green light, it would take another year for engineers to finish routine testing of the spacecraft, said mission principal investigator Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles. \"It's like running a relay race,\" Russell said. \"You're on your last leg and the judges suddenly say 'Stop.' You lose your momentum.\" Dawn is part of a NASA program called Discovery that seeks to explore the solar system on what for NASA is considered a shoestring budget. The program includes the Stardust mission, which last week returned to Earth with samples of comet dust. Dawn, however, has suffered several setbacks, including ruptures of two of its fuel tanks during testing, forcing engineers to reduce the amount of xenon gas that will be loaded into the tanks. The project was capped at $371 million, according to Russell, and when project scientists asked for an extra $40 million last year, NASA ordered the standdown to figure out why it was going over budget. Dantzler said that while Dawn is vital to advancing knowledge of the solar system's beginnings, overfunding it would hurt other missions. \"This is first-class science and we'll do everything we can to give it the go-ahead,'' Dantzler said in a recent interview. Dawn was supposed to be launched from Florida in June. Powered by an ion engine fueled by the xenon gas, it was to make a nine-year journey to Ceres and Vesta, located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids are believed to be remnants from the solar system's formation about 4.5 billion years ago, and studying them could provide clues into how the sun and planets emerged. Previous missions to asteroids include a Japanese probe that is believed to have landed on one last year to collect samples. Dawn would be the first spacecraft to spend months orbiting two large asteroids to study them in depth. The two asteroids are believed to have formed in different parts of the solar system and to have undergone different evolutionary processes. Ceres, the solar system's largest asteroid at about 600 miles long, appears to have a warm surface and evidence of a weak atmosphere. Vesta is about 320 miles long and appears to have been resurfaced by basaltic lava.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20060213020557/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/ap_060121_dawn_hold.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Dawn Asteroid Mission Cancelled", "date": "2006-03-03", "content": "A NASA mission being readied for launch and designed to explore two large asteroids in the solar system has been officially cancelled. \"Wemade the decision yesterday to cancel Dawn,\" said Andrew Dantzler, director of NASA's solar system division in Washington, D.C. Dantzlertold SPACE.com that NASA is looking at distributing Dawn hardware toother missions currently being considered or in the future. \"Some of the subsystems should be good for other spacecraft,\" he said. The Dawn spacecraft was to utilize an ion engine system, making use of xenon gas. Aslow-but-steady acceleration is created via an ionized propellant stream. Ionpropulsion relies on interactions of external and internal magnetic fields withelectric currents driven through the stream, thereby imparting thrust to aspacecraft on which is it mounted. Makinguse of its ion engine, Dawn was to reach 4 Vesta in 2011 and 1 Ceres in 2015. These objects arethe two most massive asteroids known, yet are very different from each other.Scientists had hoped by studying the asteroids they would glean clues about theformation of the solar system. As a NASA Discovery-class mission, Dawn was selected in December 2001--one of NASA's corps of spacecraft that are developed on a fast-paced schedule and atmodest cost compared to so-called \"flagship\" missions. Dawnwas managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California with Orbital Sciences Corporation of Dulles, Virginia developing the spacecraft. Themission had been on NASA's books for liftoff in mid-June 2006, but late lastyear was placed in \"stand down\" mode. Technical issues and cost-growth in theproject led to the decision, with an independent team assigned the duty to lookinto the problems. Lastyear it was becoming clear that there were issues with Dawn, Dantzlerexplained. \"The path for resolving all the technical issues and the certaintyon the cost number were not clear,\" he said. Theindependent assessment team for Dawn was pulled together to dig in and take atlook at mission issues \"and what it would take to get Dawn to be ready.\" Thatteam reported to NASA in January that there were 29 individual major issuesthat needed to be dealt with before Dawn was ready to go, Dantzler said. Also,there was an increased cost growth of 20 percent over Dawn's confirmation costcap of $373 million, he added, as well as a 14-month or more delay in launch. \"Overthe past month or so we've been deliberating over those findings,\" Dantzlersaid, leading to yesterday's decision. Canceling Dawn was \"the fiscally responsible thing to do,\" he said, \"...and at some point you just have to drawthe line.\" NASAreached a point where it was not clear how long and how much money it wouldtake to get Dawn off the ground, Dantzler said. The space agency is looking ata close-out cost--handling such things as hardware storage and close-outpaperwork--of somewhere between $9 million to $12 million, he said. \"Thisis clearly a tough decision. We don't take it lightly at all. But, ultimately,I believe it's the right one for the good of the Discovery program,\" Dantzlersaid. Amongthe technical problems encountered, \"there were still serious concerns\" aboutthe readiness of the ion engine propulsion system for Dawn, Dantzler said. Whenword came last year of the stand down, Dawn's principal investigator,Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles told SPACE.com that the mission could tolerate a later launch date - without any scienceimpact. He remained hopeful that NASA would allow the mission to proceed tolaunch. \"Iam having a difficult time processing and accepting the cancellation,\" saidLucy McFadden of the Department of Astronomy at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland and a Dawn team member. \"Withthe success of the Discovery Program's Deep Impact and Stardust missions,and the recent and exciting scientific results from the Hubble Space Telescopeon Ceres...we were poised to emerge into the asteroid frontier with the Dawnspacecraft,\" McFadden told SPACE.com. McFaddensaid that scientists can better understand asteroids as true protoplanets, \"ifwe could only send the spacecraft there.\" Furthermore, there are equallyintriguing clues to the intricacy of Vesta, a very different asteroid that wasalso on Dawn's trajectory, she explained. \"Thereare hundreds of people in this country and in Europe who have worked on the Dawn project for four years and had committed another decade to it...and now we aredropped,\" McFadden said. \"What can I say? It makes me cry.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/2116-nasas-dawn-asteroid-mission-cancelled.html"}, {"title": "Probe built to visit asteroids killed in budget snarl", "date": "2006-03-03", "content": "A robotic mission to study two of the solar system's largest asteroids has been killed by NASA after months of uncertainty while extensive reviews probed the mission's funding and technical credentials. The cancellation of Dawn comes amid other proposed cuts in the agency's science budget in an effort to fulfill the Vision for Space Exploration, which calls for completing the assembly of the space station, retiring the space shuttle fleet, and developing the next-generation Crew Exploration Vehicle. However, Dawn's cancellation is a rarity. Most missions under consideration for termination or deferment are relatively early in the development and design phases, but Dawn's spacecraft is currently sitting at a contractor facility at Orbital Sciences where it was undergoing final assembly last year. Missions such as Triana - a politically charged Earth observation satellite - have also found their way onto the chopping block as construction neared completion. In 1998, a NASA remote sensing satellite named Clark also fell victim to budget concerns and launch delays. NASA has tried in the past to re-use parts and instruments from abandoned spacecraft on other missions. The future of the Dawn hardware is currently unclear. Managers of the Dawn mission were first warned of trouble last October, when NASA officials ordered a halt to operations as final testing was getting underway before shipment of the craft to its Florida launch site in advance of a then-planned June 2006 blastoff. NASA simultaneously launched a thorough review of the cost overruns and technical problems facing the mission. At that point, workers were bolting on the last boxes and testing the assembled spacecraft. After the stand down, the vehicle was \"safed\" and attention was focused on paperwork items and answering questions from the independent assessment team, Dawn Principal Investigator Christopher Russell told Spaceflight Now. \"My first reaction to the news of the stand down was shock and a feeling that there must have been a better way to accomplish the confidence building that NASA obviously needed,\" Russell said. \"It is emotionally very hard to stop a race when you see the finish line in sight. And it is very hard on those people who were laid off when the stand down took place. A stand down is a very big hammer. It is not for finishing nails.\" Dawn was to have been the ninth mission of the Discovery program, which attempts to fly a higher number of missions that are lower in cost and smaller in scope than earlier NASA programs. It was selected for implementation in 2001. Plans originally called for Dawn to rocket into space aboard a Delta 2 booster as early as this June to begin its circuitous trek through the solar system that would have included a fly-by of Mars in February 2009. Dawn would have then arrived at asteroid Vesta in late 2011, where a stay of at least six months was anticipated. After departing Vesta, Dawn's ion engines would have navigated the probe toward asteroid Ceres, where it would have entered orbit in August 2015 and stayed until the end of the mission. The stand down initially made the June launch impossible, and postponements to November 2006 and early 2007 followed. Officials say Dawn had until October 2007 to launch and still reach Mars for a critical gravity assist maneuver. Dawn's science payload consisted of a framing camera provided by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute and the German Aerospace Center, DLR. The Italian Space Agency was responsible for the visible and infrared mapping spectrometer. The Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico built a gamma ray and neutron detector. The two asteroids targeted by Dawn are believed to have remained intact since their formation in the very early stages of the solar system. Scientists expected to learn the chemical composition of both asteroids, search for water-bearing minerals and a metallic core, and determine their precise mass, shape, volume, rotation rate, and gravity. The Discovery program had capped the costs of Dawn at $371 million, but project officials saw the first indication of going over-budget in early 2005, according to Russell. A new cost analysis system alerted management of a potential $7 million deficit. \"We then did a grass roots estimate of what it would take to launch successfully,\" Russell said in January. \"So everyone on the project was asked to look carefully at the work to go and provide their best estimate of the cost. This number was higher, $17 million, as one might expect when (giving) people a chance to re-estimate.\" \"Then we called in a committee of experts who just took a top level look at the costs and schedule and recommended that we add more cost and schedule reserve and fund it. This number was $40 million. It was a worst-case number but it was the number that NASA used to decide that Dawn needed to be stopped for a while so that an assessment of readiness for launch could be made.\" In the period leading up to the stand down, worries also spread concerning several key spacecraft issues. Relying on a solar electric ion propulsion system, Dawn was to have carried a tank for the xenon gas propellant required by the three cutting edge engines. The xenon tank - composed of a titanium liner covered with composite wrapping - is located deep inside the spacecraft bus, and other pieces were added around it during the manufacturing process. The flight tank inside Dawn passed pre-flight tests that included taking it to pressures far above those necessary for ground or space operations. Yet when similar tanks were put through more stringent tests, they ruptured at pressures lower than the expected design limits. By finding that the tank was not as strong as first thought, engineers were forced to compensate the weakness by forming a new strategy that included not filling the tank to its full capacity. Trouble with the Power Processing Units was also plaguing the project. Built by L3 Communications, the units provide the electrical power to the thrusters in the ion propulsion system. Officials say the delivery of at least one PPU was delayed and that there may have been workmanship problems. Another concern with the stress on the craft's materials during the \"bakeout\" procedure was also raised shortly before the work stoppage was ordered. \"It was not any one problem with the spacecraft, but the problems continued to occur as the mission development continued,\" Russell said before the cancellation. \"I would say this is the normal course of events in this business. Those holding the purse strings did not have my confidence. I do not believe any one problem such as a blown fuse, or over-heating of a part, or some contamination on a connector was the trigger. It was that we reported every problem as it occurred, so there was a series of problems.\" Despite these issues, scientists close to the project felt that Dawn's problems were not all that different from those encountered during in preparation for the launch of any deep space probe. \"I have always felt that Dawn was in better shape than previous missions with which I was involved,\" Russell said earlier. \"At a minimum, we are 'in family' with the other missions in terms of open paperwork, schedule delays, and technical issues.\" As recently as four weeks ago, Russell still held out hope that Dawn would be cleared to proceed toward launch. The Discovery program is currently accepting new proposals for a new mission that must launch by 2013 with costs under $425 million. Next in line for the program is the Kepler mission that will seek Earth-size planets around nearby stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

The cancellation, announced Thursday, is the latest setback for NASA, which has been forced to delay science missions to focus on developing a new manned spacecraft to return to the moon in the next decade. Earlier this year, the space agency said it had postponed the planned launch of the Dawn spacecraft this summer as it awaited a review by an independent team. The team presented its findings at a meeting with NASA officials and project scientists in January. The project was capped at around $371 million, project scientists said previously. But the program was ordered to stand down after scientists asked for an additional $40 million last year. Exact costs were not available Thursday. Dawn was supposed to lift off in June on a nine-year voyage to two of the solar system's largest asteroids, Ceres and Vesta, which reside in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Dawn mission was put on standdown last October after going over budget and suffering several setbacks that included the rupture of two xenon fuel tanks during testing, forcing engineers to reduce the amount of xenon to be loaded in the tanks. Asteroids are believed to be remnants from the solar system's formation about 4.5 billion years ago, and studying them could provide clues into how the sun and planets formed. Dawn would have been the first spacecraft to orbit the two asteroids, which scientists believe formed in different parts of the solar system and had different evolutionary processes. The Dawn spacecraft was to reach Vesta, 220 million miles (350 million kilometers) from Earth, in 2011. It was then supposed to have reached Ceres, about 258 million miles (410 million kilometers) from Earth, in 2015. It was to spend several months orbiting each asteroid, photographing the surface and studying the interior composition, density and magnetism. Dawn was part of a NASA program called Discovery that aims to explore the solar system on what the space agency considers to be a shoestring budget. The program includes the Stardust mission, which returned to Earth in January with samples of comet dust. The Dawn mission was managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

The Dawn project was canceled on March 2, five months after it was put on hold because of cost overruns and technical problems. NASA's unusual step to review Dawn's termination came after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which manages the mission, presented new evidence in support of it, the space agency said Wednesday in a statement. It's the first time in recent memory that a NASA center has challenged a headquarters decision on a canceled mission, said NASA spokeswoman Erica Hupp. The review, headed by NASA Associate Administrator Rex Geveden, will take into account JPL's new findings and the results from an independent team dispatched to evaluate the mission. A decision was expected as early as the end of the month. NASA headquarters declined to say what the new evidence was and refused to make Geveden available for an interview. JPL spokeswoman Veronica McGregor said the center had no comment pending the review. JPL director Charles Elachi previously expressed disappointment in the cancellation. Elachi said the technical woes cited by the independent team were either resolved or close to being fixed in time for a liftoff next year. Powered by a xenon ion engine, Dawn was supposed to be the first spacecraft to circle Ceres and Vesta, two of the solar system's largest asteroids that reside in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists believe asteroids are leftover rocky remnants from the solar system's birth about 4.5 billion years ago, and studying them could yield insight into how the sun and planets formed. NASA put Dawn on hold last October due to budget issues and problems with the spacecraft's fuel tanks. It then convened an independent team to assess the program. Project managers were taken aback earlier this month when Mary Cleave, NASA's associate administrator for the science mission directorate, scrubbed the mission after a congressional budget hearing. Dawn's cancellation came at a time when NASA had been forced to delay several science missions to focus on retiring the space shuttle fleet and developing new manned vehicles to return to the moon in the next decade. Andrew Dantzler, director of NASA's solar system division, previously cited cost overruns and technical issues as the main factors for cutting Dawn.

The space agency officially killed the missionearlier this month, citing an independent assessment that flagged over twodozen major issues in need of resolution before Dawn was ready to go. The abandonment of the mission was also due to its increasedcost growth of 20 percent over Dawn's confirmation cost cap of $373 million, aswell as a 14-month or more delay in launching the spacecraft, NASA officialssaid at the time. The death of Dawn has stirred up anger in scientificcircles, both in the United States and abroad - a fact that surfaced hereearlier this week at the 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC). When pressed by scientists to clarify whether or not theDawn mission has been restored, NASA Associate Administrator for Science, MaryCleave, said NASA is responsive to Congressional language that dictates \"if weget to a certain percentage cost overrun we have to review a project. And if itgets to another percentage Congress will zero the money going in and we will bein this limbo with no money going in.\" Another reply regarding the status of Dawn came from AndrewDantzler, director of NASA's solar system division in Washington, D.C. \"I really can't get into the details on Dawn,\" Dantzler toldthe LPSC gathering, but noted that the cancellation \"is under review by ourmanagement.\" Because of that fact, he added, it would not be appropriate to getinto specifics. The cost to standdown Dawn was slated not to be more than $5 million dollars and hasn'tbeen, Dantzler said. \"Continuing Dawn is significantly more,\" he said. Dantzler said that termination of a mission or a budget cut \"is a very serious issue,\" with NASA doing everything it can not do that. In terms of the technical problems of Dawn, Dantzler saidthat \"it would not be wise to go into technical detail.\" While the findings of a new review are yet to play out, NASA's cancellation of Dawn in the first place incensed scientists, not onlythose in the U.S. but in other countries taking part in the mission. \"It's totally unacceptable what's happening now,\" said Gerhard Neukum, professor of planetary sciences at Freie Universit't Berlin inGermany and a member of the Dawn team. There is international involvement in Dawn, Neukum pointedout. \"NASA has responsibility to their cooperation partners first and foremostbefore they go to the last resort of canceling a mission,\" he told SPACE.com. \"It's absolutely ridiculous what NASA is doing,\" Neukumsaid, \"because most of the money has been spent.\" Neukum noted that \"the mission is practically ready to go.There are a few technical problems that are overstated on NASA's side. It's nota well-based, neutral review in my opinion.\" \"We didn't know what was going on,\" Neukum said. \"If thereis cost-overrun you just can't go on,\" he admitted, but added: \"You have toreview it and see where it comes from and then try to remedy things. You findthe cause and possibly save the mission. That should be the first goal.\" The response from NASA officials here at the LPSC meetingconcerning the cancellation of Dawn seemed to Neukum as if they cancelled themission to free some money for other purposes. \"This is absolutely unacceptable what's going on there. Itwas unilateral, without prior warning and no discussion,\" Neukum said. \"I knowthat there were some other technical problems, but no fundamental ones. Theyall could be fixed,\" he explained. Dawn is under the rubric of NASA's econo-class Discoveryprogram. It was selectedin December 2001 to be developed on a fast-paced schedule and at modest costcompared to so-called \"flagship\" missions. Using ion propulsion, Dawn's objective has been to reachasteroids 4 Vesta in 2011 and 1 Ceres in 2015. By surveying those mini-worldsup-close, scientists want to glean clues about the formation of the solarsystem. Dawn is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) inPasadena, California with Orbital Sciences Corporation of Dulles, Virginiadeveloping the spacecraft. The mission was slated for liftoff in mid-June 2006, butlate last year was placed in \"stand down\" mode. Mounting technical issues and cost growth in the project led to the standdown, with an independent assessment team tagged with the duty to look into theproblems. The scuffle over Dawn was spotlighted by Jonathan Lunine,Professor of Planetary Sciences and of Physics at the University of Arizona inTucson during a major talk at LPSC on the future of solar system exploration. \"Dawn -- which actually did get canceled but is now on somekind of life-support...or there's some religious ceremony in which it's beingresurrected -- if it does go to two very large asteroids, Ceres and Vesta, itis a very important mission.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/2163-nasa-dawn-mission-cancellation-review.html"}, {"title": "NASA Reinstates the Dawn Mission", "date": "2006-03-27", "content": "NASA senior management announced a decision Monday to reinstate the Dawn mission, a robotic exploration of two major asteroids. Dawn had been canceled because of technical problems and cost overruns. The mission, named because it was designed to study objects dating from the dawn of the solar system, would travel to Vesta and Ceres, two of the largest asteroids orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter. Dawn will use an electric ion propulsion system and orbit multiple objects. The mission originally was approved in December 2001 and was set for launch in June 2006. Technical problems and other difficulties delayed the projected launch date to July 2007 and pushed the cost from its original estimate of $373 million to $446 million. The decision to cancel Dawn was made March 2, 2006, after about $257 million already had been spent. An additional expenditure of about $14 million would have been required to terminate the project. The reinstatement resulted from a review process that is part of new management procedures established by NASA Administrator Michael Griffin. The process is intended to help ensure open debate and thorough evaluation of major decisions regarding space exploration and agency operations. \"We revisited a number of technical and financial challenges and the work being done to address them,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Rex Geveden, who chaired the review panel. \"Our review determined the project team has made substantive progress on many of this mission's technical issues, and, in the end, we have confidence the mission will succeed.\" ", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2006-03-nasa-reinstates-dawn-mission.html"}, {"title": "NASA Reinstates Cancelled Asteroid Mission", "date": "2006-03-27", "content": "NASA's once-canceled Dawn mission to visit a pair of asteroids has been reinstated following amission review, space agency officials said Monday. NASA initially canceled the Dawn mission, which calls for an ion-powered spacecraft to visit two large asteroids, earlier this month only to reverse that decision, which drew ire and opposition from planetary scientists at this month's 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC). After an in-depth study of the cost over runs and technical challenges plaguing Dawn's development, NASA officials concluded that the mission should proceed towards asummer 2007 launch target. \"When you're doing deep planetary missions. There are always pretty tall challenges,\" NASA associate administrator Rex Geveden told reporters in a Monday teleconference. \"And it looks like Dawn is ready to take those on and beat them.\" The decision buoyed Dawn mission scientists, who had mourned the project's cancellation earlier this month. \"This mission goes up and down, but I'm happy,\" Dawn team member Lucy McFadden, of the Department of Astronomy at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland, told SPACE.com. \"I want toget to work and get this thing off the ground.\" Dawn's new light NASA first approved the Dawn mission in 2001 as part of its low-cost Discovery mission program. The spacecraft's novel ion propulsion system draws on technology demonstrated by NASA's DeepSpace 1 probe, though Dawn would mark the agency's first science mission toemploy such an engine. Europe's SMART-1 probe currently circling the moon also uses ion propulsion. \"This is,in fact, quite an ambitious mission,\" said Colleen Hartman, NASA's deputyassociate administrator for science mission directorate, during the teleconference. \"The things we're doing here are tough, they're not easy.\" Dawn isdestined to rendezvous and orbit both Vesta and Ceres,two of the largest asteroids in the Asteroid Belt, in 2011 and 2015, respectively. \"Getting toCeres and Vesta will be opening up our eyes to newworlds,\" McFadden said, adding that the large asteroids formed quickly in theearly Solar System and harbor many mysteries for scientists, including theirsurface composition and features. \"We just have the barest hint from maps that we've derived from the Hubble Space Telescopeon their surface features.\" During its development, the cost Dawn's mission swelled from an initial $373 million to$446 million due to technical challenges, NASA officials said. That costoverrun and a 14-month launch delay from its intended summer 2006 target prompted NASA's March 2 decision to scrap the mission, which came after $257 million had already been spent, the agency said. An additional $14 million would have been required to cancel the mission completely, NASA said. Off again, on again Technical challenges revolving around Dawn's propulsion system, xenon fuel tank and thermal stresses \"among others\" contributed to its cancellation, NASA officials said, adding that those concerns have since been addressed byadditional data. \"What we had here was a very gut-wrenching decision\" Hartman said. \"And we're veryhappy to be going forward.\" But areview process instituted by NASA chief Michael Griffin to evaluate the cancellation of NASA space missions proved successful for Dawn's supporters. \"The science mission directorate decided to terminate it, and the appeal [was] tosee if we continue to fund Dawn or go on with that termination,\" said Andrew Dantzler, director of NASA's solar system division at the agency's Washington, D.C. headquarters, during an interview last week. NASA officials said Monday that the process is likely not one that will occur often, adding that Dawn has accrued about $5 million in additional costs since the agency ordered mission managers and scientists to stand downlast fall when cancellation discussions began in earnest. \"We revisited a number of technical and financial challenges and the work beingdone to address them,\" NASA associate administrator Rex Geveden said in anearlier statement. \"Our review determined the project team has made substantive progress, we have confidence the mission will succeed.\" The fundsto save the project likely prevented other programs from moving ahead, Hartman added. \"These arehard choices and sometimes future missions or current missions have tosacrifice,\" Geveden added during the teleconference.

During the past month, it has endured the extreme heat and cold of spaceflight in a large vacuum chamber at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC. In the last few months of 2006, the spacecraft underwent a broad range of tests at Orbital Sciences Corporation in Dulles, Virginia. It passed all of them, and for graduation the spacecraft, along with its retinue of mechanical and electrical test and support equipment, was sent on a pleasingly uneventful drive to NRL during the first weekend in January. Once it arrived, preparations began immediately for the next set of tests in NRL's thermal vacuum chamber. After the spacecraft and special monitoring equipment were installed in the chamber, plates whose temperature could be individually controlled were positioned around the spacecraft to ensure the desired thermal test conditions could be achieved. Pumps began removing air early in the evening of January 23, and by the next morning, the interior of the chamber was more than 100 million times below normal atmospheric pressure. Dawn experienced the same vacuum condition last summer, but that was to drive off contaminants. This time, the goal was to operate the spacecraft in ways similar to what it will face during its mission. By subjecting it to heat and cold, and testing the performance of its subsystems under both extremes, the engineering team could verify that the critically important thermal control subsystem will be able to keep temperatures within desired limits throughout the full range of conditions Dawn will encounter in space. The enormous solar arrays had been removed at Orbital and will not be reconnected to the spacecraft until April. The vacuum chamber at NRL is not large enough to accommodate the arrays when they are open, extending 19.7 meters tip-to-tip. If they had been in their stowed, or folded, position for these tests, as they will be when on the rocket, they would have covered parts of the structure that are supposed to be exposed in space. That would have retained heat inside the probe and prevented these tests from accurately duplicating the temperatures it will experience in space. After the chamber pressure was reduced, the temperature was raised gradually to 45\u00b0C and held there for almost a week while engineering and science subsystems were put through their paces. Following that, quite unaware of the hibernal, but comparatively balmy, conditions outside NRL, the spacecraft was brought to -25\u00b0C for several more days of tests. Although it is designed to operate under these conditions, few of the Dawn team members are well suited either to working in the absence of air or at such temperatures. Therefore, on February 8, when the time came to make planned changes in the test configuration, the chamber was brought back to normal atmospheric pressure and temperature so people could enter. Tests resumed the next day under vacuum. Among other activities in this second phase, some mission scenario tests were conducted. Unlike the many tests focused on individual subsystems, these were designed to make the subsystems work together as they must when Dawn is operating in orbit around distant Vesta, the first of its mysterious and enticing destinations. In fact, the mission scenario tests provide an opportunity to assess even more than the collective performance of the subsystems; the spacecraft and some of the systems in mission control operate together in much the same way they will during the mission. On February 14, Dawn's ion propulsion system was powered on for its long- awaited \"hot fire test.\" The ion propulsion system cannot operate in normal atmospheric pressure, so although its individual components had been tested quite extensively, this was the only opportunity to test them all together. The digital control interface units, power processor units, xenon feed system, and thrusters all performed beautifully. The extremely gentle thrust, as described in the last log, caused no more movement of the spacecraft than if a piece of paper had been lain on it, but the team certainly felt a powerful boost to see the bluish glow of the thruster and gain one more indication that Dawn is getting close to flight. The spacecraft has 3 thrusters, with only 1 to be operated at a time in the mission. In this test, one of them could not be fired because it was blocked by hardware supporting the spacecraft. That thruster still had a nearly full test. It ionized xenon but did not apply the voltage needed to accelerate the ions. Between the other 2 thrusters, the ion propulsion system operated at 5 different throttle levels for a total of 34 minutes of thrusting. To generate propulsion, the thrusters emit high velocity xenon ions. The impingement of those ions on nearly any object, including the chamber wall, could erode it, blasting off contaminants that could settle on the spacecraft. Therefore, specially designed targets were positioned about 2 meters from the thrusters. Myriad specially oriented fibers of carbon on the targets captured most of the materials that the ions would otherwise have liberated. Sensors located in the vicinity proved that this system did indeed prevent adverse levels of contamination from accumulating. In fact, it worked so well that the hot fire test could have continued longer than planned, but there was no need for an extension. The thermal vacuum testing concluded on February 17, and the spacecraft was removed from the chamber two days later. As the operations in the vacuum chamber were so intensive, with the team working around the clock, a tremendous amount of data was collected, and it will require several weeks for engineers to analyze all of them. Serving its purpose well, however, the test has already pointed to several changes that will bring the maturing space probe closer to its final readiness for flight, such as adjusting the size of some heaters, the amount of insulation over certain components, and the values of parameters in software that control temperatures. While this and other work is being conducted on the spacecraft, the unit that governs the delivery of electrical power from the solar arrays to the onboard subsystems will be removed and returned to JPL where engineers will make some modifications. With the thermal vacuum work having been completed, representing the end of Dawn's many months of environmental testing, this would conclude our update on Dawn's progress, were it not for an item we report on with some pride. The last log was chosen by readers on a majority of planets surveyed as being among the 1000 \"Most Interesting Dawn Articles Written on December 28, 2006.\" Lest this be misinterpreted as being even more prestigious than it is, it should be revealed that this recognition applies only in the category of articles of 1900 - 2000 words. Nevertheless, it is this kind of appreciation that makes the many seconds of writing seem worthwhile. This surge in interest may be attributed to the inclusion of an explanation of the principles underlying the ion propulsion system, the remarkable technology that enables Dawn to undertake its unique and exciting mission. Thus, to build upon the success of the previous log, it may be interesting to explore how the IPS is used and why it makes operating Dawn different from deep space missions with conventional propulsion. We'll see much much more about this as we join Dawn on its long flight through space, but for now, let's take a very brief look at how spacecraft reach their extraterrestrial destinations and see some of the differences when ion propulsion is used. The physics that explains the complex beauty of orbital ballet tells us that the velocity of any object in orbit around the Sun, be it one of humankind's interplanetary robotic explorers or the solar system's natural residents of planets, asteroids, and comets, depends upon the exact shape and size of its orbit and where it is in the orbit. All orbits are ellipses, but the degree of flattening and the overall size allow for an infinite range of theoretically possible orbits. Because of our understanding of the mathematical principles, if we know the orbit, we can calculate the velocity at any position in the orbit; if we know the velocity at any one position, we can calculate the entire orbit. We also know that if we change the velocity at any position, the overall shape and size of the entire orbit will change. Celestial navigators have developed remarkably sophisticated methods of using these seemingly simple principles to achieve astronomical accuracy in flying throughout the solar system. To deliver a spacecraft to its remote destination, engineers use the nature of orbits to choreograph the perfect cosmic dance, ensuring that the individual performers arrive at the same spot at the same time. When the paths of the spacecraft and the target cross, the laws of celestial motion dictate that the objects following the orbits travel at very different velocities, generally many kilometers per second for interplanetary missions. If the goal is to fly by the target, the spacecraft conducts its observations during the brief time they are near each other; no additional orbit changes are needed. Suppose instead the objective is to go into orbit around the destination. That means the spacecraft will join the target as the latter follows its own orbit around the Sun, just as the moon and satellites in Earth orbit accompany our planet on its annual heliocentric loop. To accomplish this, the spacecraft must swerve from its original solar orbit in order to match the speed and direction of its new solar orbit, which is precisely the same as the target's orbit around the Sun. Perhaps imagining this, as one gazes thoughtfully into the cosmic void, it becomes clear why spacecraft usually have to execute a large burn of their propulsion systems to get into orbit around another solar system body. That maneuver accomplishes the swerve to change the craft's path around the Sun. Interplanetary missions with conventional chemical propulsion rely on a powerful rocket to be thrown from Earth into orbit around the Sun, after which they spend months or years following that orbit, coasting to their targets. On occasion, the flight may be interrupted by a brief firing of the spacecraft's engine to adjust its course or a more dramatic passage by a planet whose gravity alters the orbit, thereby boosting the probe on its way, but for the most part, the journey is a very passive one, with the craft doing little to help itself along. Upon reaching its target, it fires up its engine again to veer into its new orbit. In effect, most missions floor it very briefly and coast most of the time. The use of the IPS creates a very different situation. The rocket does not place Dawn into an orbit that will intersect the orbit of its target. Dawn is so much more capable of its own maneuvering, that it relies on the rocket only to propel it away from Earth. Once its journey has begun, it steers its own course. By thrusting gently but persistently for years, Dawn constantly reshapes its orbit around the Sun. The flight profile -- the direction and timing of the thrusting -- is calculated to smoothly sculpt Dawn's orbit, gradually changing the trajectory so that it is identical to that of its quarry. With its amazingly low rate of fuel consumption, Dawn will spend most of its mission with a light touch on the accelerator. Contrary to common intuition, unlike missions with chemical propulsion, Dawn will not have to execute a special, dedicated ion thrusting maneuver to get into orbit around Vesta or Ceres. Indeed, the thrusting to arrive in orbit will be no different from the years of thrusting that precede it. With the utmost elegance, Dawn will approach each target very slowly because, under the influence of its IPS, its orbit around the Sun will slowly take the required shape. Instead of veering and swerving, Dawn's maneuvering will be characterized more by grace and delicacy. As it creeps up on an asteroid, it will slip into orbit so gently that a casual observer would not even notice the transition. One of the many consequences of the whisper-like force of the IPS is that engineers must ensure that the flight profile allows enough time to accomplish the needed thrusting. Because of the rigors of space travel and the complexity of spacecraft engineering, all probes experience the occasional unexpected event that interferes with planned activities, and much sophisticated work is devoted to developing systems to safeguarding the lonely craft when such anomalies arise. So the Dawn mission must be designed to account for the inevitable glitches that will interrupt thrusting, whether they be from a burst of cosmic radiation, a software bug, or a balky component. For a conventional planetary orbit insertion, if the maneuver of a few tens of minutes were missed, the objectives of the entire mission would be lost -- there can be no second chance. Propulsion then is truly vital, so most missions have very short periods of extremely high vulnerability and long periods of no vulnerability at all. A great deal of effort is devoted to protecting the critical minutes. With ion propulsion, missions generally have very long intervals of low vulnerability. Part of the arcane science of formulating Dawn's flight profile is ensuring that the mission can tolerate weeks of missed thrusting at any time and still make its way to the distant worlds Vesta and Ceres to help unlock the secrets they hold. Dawn's next destination is Cape Canaveral. We will check in again in April once the spacecraft has arrived at that familiar part of the solar system to begin final preparations for launch.

Dawn isslated to rendezvous and orbit Vesta in 2011 before heading off for a February 2015 appointment with Ceres. Both asteroids sit in the Asteroid Belt that runs between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

By studying the asteroids Vesta and Ceres, astronomers hope to learn more about how the rest of the solar system formed, including Earth. Dawn lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Air Force station in Florida, US, at 1234 GMT on Thursday aboard a Delta II rocket. Before it gets to the asteroid belt, Dawn will first swing by Mars in February 2011. This encounter will boost it on towards its scheduled rendezvous with asteroid Vesta in August 2011. After nine months orbiting Vesta, Dawn will depart for the 975-kilometre-wide Ceres, which is large enough to be considered a 'dwarf planet' under the new official classification system, a designation it shares with two icy denizens of the outer solar system, Pluto and Eris. It should arrive at Ceres in 2015. Watch an animation of the Dawn mission. \"Dawn will be the first mission to journey into and explore the heart of our asteroid belt,\" says Jim Adams, deputy director of NASA's planetary science division at the agency's headquarters in Washington, DC, US. \"It will be the first to journey and orbit around two celestial bodies and it will be the first to visit a dwarf planet.\" Dawn relies on an ion propulsion system to get to its destinations, only the second NASA probe to do so. Such engines use an electric field to accelerate electrically charged atoms, or ions, to high speed, pushing the spacecraft in the opposite direction. They provide far more thrust for a given amount of fuel than conventional rocket engines. \"The first time I ever heard of ion propulsion was in a Star Trek episode,\" says Dawn mission engineer Marc Rayman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, US. \"One of the rewards of working on a project like this is getting to turn that science fiction into science fact.\" Vesta and Ceres are large enough to be thought of as worlds of their own, and are some of the last such worlds in the inner solar system that remain unexplored, Rayman says&colon; \"I think many people think of asteroids as kind of little chips of rock, but the places that Dawn is going to really are more like worlds they really are like small planets.\" Brush with death Scientists hope that investigating Vesta and Ceres will help them learn more about the formation of solar system objects in general and their evolution. Vesta appears to be much drier and more modified than Ceres, which is farther from the Sun than Vesta and contains a lot of water ice. Various problems, including bad weather and logistical problems with the launch of NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander, had caused repeated postponements of the spacecraft's launch. Launch delays have not been the only problem for Dawn. The mission had a close brush with death in March 2006, when NASA announced a decision to cancel it, citing cost overruns. But less than a month later, the agency revived the mission. Also, minor damage to the spacecraft had to be repaired after a worker accidentally dropped a tool on one of its solar panels in June.

In this phase of the mission, each day of thrusting changes the probe's speed by 6.7 meters/second (15 miles/hour). Dawn will operate its ion thrusters for a total of more than 5 years, providing the extraordinary boost required to orbit both main belt asteroid Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres in the quest to understand the dawn of the solar system. Some readers may be reminded of the prophetic sagacity of Tardigrade the Celeritous, who, with uncanny prescience (and, at the time, abstruseness), is believed to have said that the journey of 11 kilometers/second (25,000 miles/hour) begins with a single day of thrusting. The spacecraft is outfitted with 3 ion thrusters but will never use more than 1 at a time. In October and November, during the initial checkout phase of the mission, all 3 thrusters were tested and confirmed to be healthy and ready for operation. Following the flight plan, thruster #3 was the first to propel the craft in its interplanetary cruise phase, which began on December 17. In the 184 days from the beginning of interplanetary cruise until ion thruster #1 took over, thruster #3 operated for a total of 147 days, flawlessly changing Dawn's orbit around the Sun. Each week the thrust was turned off for a few hours when the spacecraft turned to point its main antenna to Earth, and a few days every month or so have been devoted to other, non-thrusting activities. (Readers are encouraged to review the logs posted since December to remind themselves of such activities. That might yield an unexpected reward, as it may now be revealed that the text of those logs contains a highly encrypted message with information of astonishing import. If you find it, please let this writer know, as he has absolutely no idea what it is!) The effect of thruster #3's operation during this mission phase was to change the spacecraft's speed by about 0.96 kilometers/second (2150 miles/hour). Thanks to the exceptionally high efficiency of the ion propulsion system, Dawn's solar system xenon footprint in accomplishing this was only 39 kg (86 pounds). (Note also that its carbon footprint was 0.) Switching from one thruster to another is simple (to the extent that anything is simple for early 21st century humans controlling a spacecraft in deep space). The potential complication in this case was explained in the previous log. Our readers survey (conducted by Telepathic Business Services, Inc. when their employees had time between major poker competitions) shows that 3 readers do not fully recall the details and will not refer to that log, so the issue is summarized here. The 3 ion thrusters point in different directions on the spacecraft. To provide thrust in the correct direction in space, Dawn has to rotate to aim the designated thruster in that direction. The use of thruster #1 now requires the craft to assume an orientation quite different from any that had been experienced before, and engineers were not confident certain components would remain within their required temperature limits when the Sun shone on them. Last month's test, in which the spacecraft spent a few hours pointing in the required direction, provided some of the data needed to establish when it would be safe to commit to the use of thruster #1 for long periods of time. The results agreed with previous analyses, which had shown that all the components would remain in their prescribed temperature ranges if thruster #1 were put to use this month. Probably. Probably? That \"probably\" was not good enough. Ever-cautious mission controllers were not sufficiently confident to let the spacecraft remain in the new orientation for a week at a time, because there were a few components whose temperatures still could not be predicted well enough. The analyses were conclusive that the temperatures would be safe for more than 24 hours, as it takes a long time for that hardware to heat up. Therefore, the team devised a new approach. A typical set of commands for 5 weeks of operation with thruster #1 was formulated. In addition, engineers prepared instructions for storage onboard to stop thruster #1, rotate to the thruster #3 orientation, resume thrusting, and perform all the other associated functions, the description of which is precluded by laws on profoundly incomprehensible prose. (While such laws are applicable only in the vicinity of supermassive stars, we obey them out of consideration for such regions of our distribution.) The instructions were structured so that only a single, brief message from Earth would be needed to trigger the switch back to thruster #3. On June 18, the spacecraft turned from pointing its antenna to Earth to aim thruster #1 in the correct direction and initiated thrusting. A Deep Space Network antenna that was available was scheduled to listen in to the spacecraft on June 19. Dawn was programmed to use one of its small antennas, with a very broad radio beam, to transmit temperature measurements. Dawn's terrestrial team members receiving the data found the results to be much as expected. As predicted, the temperatures had not yet stabilized, and all were within the desired ranges. When they had about two hours of measurements in hand, engineers were able to predict with high confidence what the final temperatures would be. This confirmed that continued operation was safe, so there was no need to switch back to thruster #3. (Providing the spacecraft with the capability to make that decision, while that might seem pretty neat, would have required more work than the neatness would have merited.) As some may recall from long, long ago (to be specific, 8 paragraphs ago), several days of coasting are included in the flight plan occasionally. Activities for some of those times are planned long in advance. Other such periods are held in reserve in case mission controllers identify the need for some previously unplanned work that could not be accommodated in the normal schedule. June 16 - 18 was one such interval. The mission has been going so smoothly, however, that no special activities were required then. The team did take advantage of the extra time that the primary antenna was pointed to Earth to clean up some file buffers and perform other maintenance on some of the spacecraft's computers. With the mission continuing so well, the Dawn team can devote much of its attention to preparing for future events. Although the Dawn project has no specific plans, readers may rest assured that the team members, as with their fellow residents of Earth, are completing personal plans to commemorate the centennial of the Tunguska event on June 29 (the event occurred on June 30 in Siberia's time zone). The next item of interest occurs on June 30, when the spacecraft exceeds the outermost reaches of the orbit of Mars; the probe will be farther from the Sun than that planet ever travels. Earth reaches its greatest distance from the Sun on July 4, when it will be almost 1.7% farther than its average distance. (On January 2, it was about 1.7% closer than average.) Then even as Earth begins a slow fall toward the Sun (a trend that will continue until next January), Dawn will continue its climb outward. On July 10, the robotic explorer will be twice as far from Earth as Earth will be from the Sun. At that time it will be 304 million kilometers (189 million miles) from the planet it left on a lovely dawn in September 2007. At these extraordinary distances, humankind (and even some of our other readers) does not have the technology to see the spacecraft. Indeed, Dawn is barely discernible in a pair of portraits taken when it was more than 300 times closer to Earth. Yet some who follow the mission might enjoy gazing in the direction of the probe as they contemplate its journey deeper into space and the ambitious and exciting mission that lies ahead. For those in the continental United States, the spacecraft will be between 3* and 5* northeast of the moon in the evening of July 6 as the moon is approaching the western horizon. (In other words, Dawn will appear to be 6 to 10 times the moon's diameter away, north and higher in the sky.) Although quite invisible to your eyes, in that direction your mind may be able to see with great clarity one of your planet's envoys to the cosmos. With a blue-green trail of xenon ions behind it and appointments with distant, uncharted, alien worlds ahead of it, Dawn will be silently and contentedly carrying out its mission to extend our reach into space and to help fulfill our passionate search for knowledge and our yearning for adventure. Dawn is 286 million kilometers (178 million miles) from Earth, or more than 760 times as far as the moon and 1.88 times as far as the Sun. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take 32 minutes to make the round trip.

Its path to that distant realm of the solar system is now bringing it closer to the Sun, and thanks in part to all the thrusting it has accomplished with its remarkable ion propulsion system, it has recently achieved its lowest speed so far in the mission. To understand this enigmatic behavior, read on! As most of you who have read about or visited the solar system know, the asteroid belt is much farther from the Sun than Earth is. Dawn passed outside the orbit of Mars in June, but it has not yet traveled far enough from the Sun to reach asteroid Vesta, its first destination. Dwarf planet Ceres, Dawn's second target, resides still farther in the depths of space. So readers with memories that extend as far back as the previous paragraph may wonder why Dawn apparently is backtracking, now approaching the Sun. Despite the many innovations that make this project so fascinating, the Dawn team has not yet discovered how to travel backwards in time. that occurred while writing the last log.) To see why Dawn seems to be reversing course, both heading toward the Sun and traveling more slowly now than at the beginning of its mission, we need to consider some of the principles that govern space travel. Your correspondent offered some comments on these concepts in a log for a different interplanetary mission, Deep Space 1. If not for some unexpected legal issues with certain species in spiral galaxies capable of abstract thought, we would simply reprint that material here. Instead, we shall consider some of the same ideas but with different words. The goal of this text is to provide only the gist of some of the fundamentals. In an act of selfless charity to help our hungry friends the Numerivores of Q2237+0305, this log will include more numbers than usual. It is not necessary to study them in detail; some readers may find them helpful and others may feel free to gloss over them. In any case, we can provide an absolute guarantee that by the end, with even a casual comprehension of this material, the interested reader would not find even the doctorate level examinations from the prestigious Galactic Institute of Space Travel to be difficult. The overwhelming majority of craft humans have sent into space have remained in the vicinity of Earth, accompanying that planet on its annual revolutions around the Sun. The satellites of Earth remain bound to it by its gravity. As fast as they seem to travel compared to residents of the planet, from a solar system perspective, their incessant circling of Earth means their paths through space are not very different from Earth's itself. Everything on the surface and in Earth orbit travels around the Sun at an average of around 30 kilometers/second, completing one full solar orbit every year. To undertake its interplanetary exploration and travel elsewhere in the solar system, Dawn needed to break free of Earth's grasp, and that was accomplished by the rocket that carried it to space last year. Dawn and its erstwhile home went their separate ways, and the Sun became the natural reference for the spacecraft's position and speed on its travels in deep space. Despite the enormous push the Delta II rocket delivered to Dawn, the spacecraft still did not have nearly enough energy to escape from the powerful Sun. So, being a responsible resident of the solar system, Dawn remains faithfully in orbit around the Sun, just as do Earth and the rest of the planets, asteroids, comets, and other members of the Sun's entourage. Whether it is for a spacecraft or moon orbiting a planet, a planet or Dawn orbiting the Sun, the Sun orbiting the Milky Way galaxy, or the Milky Way galaxy orbiting the Virgo supercluster of galaxies, any orbit is the perfect balance between the inward tug of gravity and the inexorable tendency of objects to travel in a straight path. If you attach a weight to a string and swing it around in a circle, the force you use to pull on the string mimics the gravitational force the Sun exerts on the bodies that orbit it. The effort you expend in keeping the weight circling serves constantly to redirect its path; if you let go of the string, the weight's natural motion would carry it away in a straight line. The force of gravity diminishes with distance, so the Sun's pull on a nearby body is greater than on a more distant one. Therefore, to remain in orbit, to balance the relentless tug of gravity, the closer object must travel faster, fighting the stronger pull. The same effect applies at Earth. Satellites that orbit very close must streak around the planet at about 7.7 kilometers/second to keep from being pulled down. The moon, orbiting 1000 times farther above, needs only to travel at about 1.0 kilometers/second to balance Earth's weaker grip at that distance. Notice that this means that for an astronaut to travel from the surface of Earth to the International Space Station, it would be necessary to accelerate to quite a high speed to rendezvous with the orbital facility. But then once in orbit, to journey to the much more remote moon, the astronaut's speed eventually would have to decline dramatically. Perhaps speed tells an incomplete story in describing the travels of a spacecraft, just as it does with another example of countering gravity. A person throwing a ball is not that different from a rocket launching a satellite. Both represent struggles against Earth's gravitational pull. To throw a ball higher, you have to give it a harder push, imparting more energy to make it climb away from Earth, but as soon as it leaves your hand, it begins slowing. For a harder throw, it will take longer for Earth's gravity to stop the ball and bring it back, so it will travel higher. But from the moment it leaves your hand until it reaches the top of its arc, its speed constantly dwindles as it gradually yields to Earth's tug. The astronaut's trip from the space station to the moon would be accomplished by starting with a high speed \"throw\" from the low starting orbit, and then slowing down until reaching the moon. The rocket that launched Dawn threw it hard enough to escape from Earth, sending it well beyond the International Space Station and the moon. Indeed, the spacecraft is now more than 1 million times farther away than the station. Dawn's maximum speed relative to Earth on launch day was so high that Earth could not pull it back. As mentioned in an earlier log, Dawn was propelled to 11.46 kilometers per second, well in excess of the space station's orbital speed given 3 paragraphs above. But it remains under the Sun's control. If the spacecraft had never operated its ion propulsion system, it would have coasted away from the Sun, slowing down the entire time, reaching the top of its interplanetary arc on July 2, 2008. Then, at almost 242 million kilometers from the Sun, as it succumbed to the massive star's pull, it would have begun its inward fall. Many solar system residents find measuring distances in millions of kilometers to be inconvenient, so it is common to use the \"astronomical unit\". The average distance between Earth and the Sun, nearly 150 million kilometers is defined to be 1 AU. So Dawn would have reached almost 1.62 AU from the Sun without thrusting. After that, the probe would not have fallen all the way back to the Sun, ending in a useless blaze. Because it departed from Earth, which was already orbiting the Sun, and not from a stationary platform, it began with energy adequate to keep it at Earth's orbit. Upon allowing the Sun to pull it back, it would come only to about that same orbit, reaching a minimum distance of 1.00 AU from the Sun on April 1, 2009. So Dawn would have been in an elliptical solar orbit, ranging from 1.00 AU to 1.62 AU. It would have traveled faster and faster as it swooped to its smallest distance and then slowed down again as it sailed back out to the largest distance, much like a person on a swing, slowing near the top, speeding through the lowest point, and then repeating that pattern. The change in speed with distance is an essential characteristic of all orbits. Now think again of the ball you throw. If it had a tiny propulsion system to help it along its way, that extra boost would propel it higher, supplementing the energy you imparted to it when it left your hand. Unlike a powerful rocket that accelerates as it ascends, if the additional thrust were low, it might not be able to completely counter the slowing from Earth's gravity, but it might help reach a higher altitude before beginning its fall. As Dawn's famously efficient ion propulsion system has given it a delicate but steady push on its flight away from the Sun, the spacecraft has been able to resist the Sun's incessant pull longer. Instead of turning back in early July, Dawn flew outward until August 8. Even with all the thrusting, it was constantly slowing down, and when the Sun's gravity overwhelmed it, it began its inward flight. But by then the ion thrusting had changed the shape of its elliptical orbit so it would not fall back as far as Earth's orbital distance. If it undertook no more thrusting after August 8, it would come back only to 1.16 AU from the Sun, reaching that distance on June 14, 2009. As we will see in future logs, it will not have the opportunity to drop even that close to the Sun however, because ion propulsion continues modifying its orbit. In addition, on approximately February 18, 2009, the probe will pass by Mars, and the gravitational deflection will cause still more changes to its orbit around the Sun, which eventually will take it to the asteroid belt. On September 27, 2007, some 2 minutes after it had separated from its rocket, Dawn reached its highest speed relative to the Sun for the entire mission. At that time, it was traveling at about 38.95 kilometers/second. Earth were moving around the Sun at the more leisurely pace of 29.70 kilometers/second. So what has been the effect of Dawn's thrusting since then? By August 8 it had expended about 55.4 kilograms of xenon propellant, some for tests during the initial checkout phase of the mission and most with the specific intent of altering its orbit around the Sun. If this were solely for the purpose of accelerating without the complex patterns involved in orbital dances, the effect would have been to increase Dawn's speed by 1.38 kilometers/second. But because of the way forces and velocities work in space travel, in pushing Dawn away from the Sun, allowing it to travel \"higher\" before the Sun pulled it back, the ion propulsion system helped Dawn continue away from the Sun until, on August 8, it was more than 1.68 AU from the master of the solar system. By then, its speed had fallen to 20.77 kilometers/second. At the same moment Dawn was orbiting the Sun at that rate, distant Earth was racing in its orbit at 29.38 kilometers/second. When Dawn began coming back in toward the Sun, it was in a different part of the solar system from where it would have been had it never applied its ion propulsion system to so patiently yet persistently change the orbit the Delta rocket left it in. In the absence of any ion thrusting, the spacecraft would have been 0.45 AU away from its actual location on August 8. Dawn will rendezvous with Vesta in about 3 years. To match that asteroid's orbit around the Sun, our robotic explorer will have to continue tuning its orbital parameters so that it will be almost 2.3 AU from the Sun while traveling at about 20 kilometers/second, farther and slower than its current orbit or that of its quondam planetary domicile. Achieving the required speed and distance alone is not enough to ensure Dawn can slip into orbit around Vesta, but we will consider other aspects of this problem in a future log. In the meantime, we can think of the general problem of flying elsewhere in space as similar to climbing a hill. For terrestrial hikers, the rewards of ascent come only after doing the work of pushing against Earth's gravity to reach a higher elevation. Similarly, Dawn is climbing a solar system hill with the Sun at the bottom. It started from Earth, at 1 AU in elevation; and its first rewards await it higher up that hill at 2.3 AU, where Vesta, traveling at only about two thirds of Earth's speed, keeps its records of the dawn of the solar system. Ceres is still higher up the hill, moving even more slowly to balance the still-weaker pull of the Sun. If this were only a climb, it would be easy to stop at the correct spot on the solar system hill. This simple analogy fails us here though, because everything is in orbital motion. With a big enough rocket, or gravitational boosts, it would not be difficult to throw Dawn hard enough that it would fly out to Vesta or beyond, and some other spacecraft have coasted past that distance from the Sun. But to enter orbit, Dawn must precisely match Vesta's path around the Sun, joining it for a portion of the asteroid's regular 3.6-year circuit around the Sun, just as Earth's natural and human-made satellites stay with it throughout its 1-year orbit. That is part of the reason the spacecraft needs ion propulsion. The ion propulsion system allows Dawn not only to carry its scientific instruments up that hill but also to \"stop\" on the slope, neither falling back toward the Sun nor coasting by the asteroid. When a subsequent log addresses what more is required than speed and distance, we will see why this is more difficult than it may appear. We are confident that in meeting this great challenge, should Dawn remain healthy, it will be a shoo-in in the next solar system Olympics, aiming not for a bronze medal, nor for one of silver or gold but rather for the most highly coveted: the xenon medal. We promised near the beginning that for those who completed this arduous log, the examinations at the prestigious Galactic Institute of Space Travel would not prove difficult. The reason is simple: there is no such organization; we made it up. Nevertheless, following Dawn's long and ambitious journey does not require mastery of the concepts touched upon here. All that really is needed is the desire to learn more about the cosmos, to share in one of humankind's bold adventures to explore the unknown as we set our sights on extraordinarily distant goals and aspire to something well beyond the confines of our humble home in the universe. Dawn is 352 million kilometers from Earth, or 955 times as far as the moon and 2.33 times as far as the Sun. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take 39 minutes to make the round trip.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2008/8/august-2008"}, {"title": "", "date": "2008-09-27", "content": "On the first anniversary of its departure from Earth, Dawn continues with what it has been doing for most of its time in space: with the greatest patience it is gently reshaping its orbit around the Sun with its ion propulsion system. In its first year of travels, the spacecraft has thrust for a total of about 253 days, or 69% of the time. Dawn has been in powered flight for 85% of the time since the beginning of its interplanetary cruise phase in December 2007 and about 0.000000005% of the time since the Big Bang. While for most spacecraft, firing a thruster to change course is a special event, it is Dawn's wont. All this thrusting has cost the craft only 67 kilograms of its supply of xenon propellant, which was 425 kilograms 1 year ago. The thrusting so far in the mission has achieved the equivalent of accelerating the probe by 1.68 kilometers per second. As the preceding log described, because of the principles of motion for orbital flight, whether around the Sun or any other gravitating body, Dawn is not actually traveling this much faster than when it launched. But the effective change in speed remains a useful measure of the effect of any spacecraft's propulsive work. Having accomplished only one-eighth of the thrust time planned for its entire mission, Dawn has already exceeded the velocity change required by many spacecraft. .) Since launch, our readers who have remained on or near Earth have completed exactly 1 revolution around the Sun. Orbiting farther from the Sun than Earth, and moving at a more leisurely pace, Dawn has not traveled even two-thirds of the way around the Sun. Of course, unlike Earth, when it has completed 1 full circuit, it will not be at the same place it started. Earth's orbit is quite repetitive, but the combined effects of the powerful rocket launch, the extensive ion thrusting, and the gravitational deflection from Mars next February will cause the spacecraft to be farther from the Sun at the end of its first revolution than it was at the beginning. As readers who have followed the Dawn mission during 2008 know, the spacecraft occasionally engages in activities other than routine thrusting as its adventure progresses. On August 26, mission controllers commanded the primary and backup cameras to execute their calibration routines. This not only served to confirm that both units remain healthy, but it also let engineers verify one of the new features in the software radioed to each camera in April that was not tested at that time. On September 22, an updated version of a method to establish how much power Dawn's extraordinary solar arrays can generate was tested successfully. The first test was conducted in July, and it yielded only some of the desired information. The revised procedure was very similar to the earlier one, principally differing in the timing of some instructions and values of parameters based on the analysis of that initial run. Because the entire activity, even including the 41-minute round-trip travel time for radio signals, required less than 3 hours in the middle of the afternoon, among the most significant changes that ever- observant mission controllers detected was that no meals were incorporated into the carefully engineered plan. As in July, the test included rotating both solar array wings 45 degrees, so they did not point directly at the Sun, thus reducing how much light they received and converted to electrical power. The test was carried out during the spacecraft's routine weekly interruption in thrusting to point its main antenna to Earth, but the ion propulsion system was commanded into service when it otherwise would have been idle. Its role then was not to provide propulsion ; rather, it participated because it is the greatest consumer of power onboard. Dawn's enormous solar arrays, even turned partially away from the Sun and more than 1.66 times farther from the radiant orb than Earth is, were able to provide the 2.5 kilowatts requested by the ion drive at full power. Later in the mission, after all the data have been analyzed thoroughly, the next step in the solar array calibration will be to command the arrays to rotate farther, where they are not expected to be able to deliver all the power requested. As Dawn begins its second year of interplanetary flight, the probe steadfastly continues its long journey in the quiet solitude of space, quite isolated from events on or near the distant planet that used to be its home. While no spacecraft has left the vicinity of the Earth-moon system in the year since Dawn's departure, much has happened there, even as the explorer has remained focused on accomplishing its voyage in deep space. From the first circulation of protons at the Large Hadron Collider 100 meters underground, to the beginning of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission 550 kilometers overhead, to the arrival of SELENE and Chang'e 1 at the moon, humankind's thrilling work to understand nature has continued. Apparently there have been some other kinds of news as well, from shocking revelations about celebrities, to competitions among athletes and among politicians, to still more shocking revelations about celebrities, but such information is harder to find, given the news media's nearly exclusive focus on myriad science topics. Dawn is 374 million kilometers from Earth, or 980 times as far as the moon and 2.49 times as far as the Sun. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take 42 minutes to make the round trip.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2008/9/september-2008"}, {"title": "Dawn Spacecraft Shuts Down Ion Engines", "date": "2008-11-21", "content": "The Dawn spacecraft's three ion engines have done their work for now, and mission engineers shut down the frugal but powerful ion propulsion system on Thursday as scheduled. The spacecraft is now gliding toward a Mars flyby/gravity assist in February 2009. \"Dawn has completed the thrusting it needs to use Mars for a gravity assist to help get us to Vesta,\" said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer from JPL \"Dawn will now coast in its orbit around the sun for the next half a year before we again fire up the ion propulsion system to continue our journey to the asteroid belt.\" The unique propulsion system will allow Dawn to travel to the asteroid Vesta in 2011, enter orbit around the asteroid, and then leave that orbit to head to orbit another asteroid, Ceres in 2015. This has never been accomplished before, and the ion engines make it all possible. Dawn's ion engines are vital to the success of the misson's 8-year, 4.9-billion-kilometer (3-billion-mile) journey to asteroid Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres. Just one of these extremely frugal powerhouses can generate more than 24 hours of thrusting while consuming about .26 kilograms (about 9 ounces) of the spacecraft's xenon fuel supply - less than the contents of a can of soda. Over their lifetime, Dawn's three ion propulsion engines will fire cumulatively for about 50,000 hours (over five years) - a record for spacecraft. Dawn's ion engines may get a short workout next January to provide any final orbital adjustments prior to its encounter with the Red Planet. Ions are also scheduled to fly out of the propulsion system during some systems testing in spring. But mostly, Dawn's three ion engines will remain silent until June, when they will again speed Dawn toward its first appointment, with Vesta. Vesta is the most geologically diverse of the large asteroids and the only known one with distinctive light and dark areas - much like the face of our Moon. Ceres is the largest body in the asteroid belt. By utilizing the same set of instruments at two separate destinations, scientists can more accurately formulate comparisons and contrasts. Dawn's science instrument suite will measure shape, surface topography, tectonic history, elemental and mineral composition, and will seek out water-bearing minerals. In addition, the Dawn spacecraft itself and how it orbits both Vesta and Ceres will be used to measure the celestial bodies' masses and gravity fields.

The planet's gravity will help boost the probe on its way to rendezvous with Vesta. While the spacecraft has its sights set on the asteroid belt, its path is now bringing it closer to Earth. Meanwhile, from Earth's perspective, Dawn appears to be approaching a blindingly close encounter with the Sun. With so much happening in the solar system, all readers, whether local or not, are invited to turn their attention here. In the last log, we saw that Dawn was nearing the end of an extended period of thrusting with is ion propulsion system that began on December 17, 2007. When it left Earth on September 27, 2007, the Delta II rocket deposited the spacecraft into a carefully chosen orbit around the Sun. By October 31, 2008, the spacecraft had completed the thrusting it needed to change that orbit so it would encounter Mars at just the right time, location, and angle to sling it on its way to Vesta. During this interplanetary cruise phase, Dawn thrust for 270 days, or 85% of the time. Expending less than 72 kilograms of xenon propellant, the spacecraft changed its speed by about 1.81 kilometers per second. Although controlling an interplanetary probe across hundreds of millions of kilometers of deep space and guiding it accurately enough to reach its remote destination seems as if it should be a very simple task, readers may be surprised to know that it is not. Let's consider just one aspect of the problem. Suppose you want to shoot an arrow at a target. Unlike typical archers, you are so far from the target that you can only barely see it. In that case, aiming for the bull's-eye is essentially out of the question. Adding to the problem may be a variable breeze that could nudge the arrow off course. Shooting sufficiently accurately to get the arrow even to the vicinity of the target would be challenging enough; hitting the precise point you want on the target is just too difficult. For readers who are principally interested in archery, this concludes our in- depth analysis of the sport. Now let's consider how to change the situation to make it more similar to an interplanetary mission. If the arrow had a tiny radio locator mounted on it, you would be able monitor its progress as it flew closer to the target. This would be like watching it on a radar screen. You might see your arrow miss the target entirely or, if you had made a particularly good shot, hit somewhere on it. Now if you could occasionally send a signal to the arrow, perhaps to change the angles of the feathers, you might not be able to alter its course drastically, but you could change it a little. So if your initial shot had been good enough, you could guide the arrow to the desired destination. Shooting the arrow is akin to launching a spacecraft, and its flight to the target represents the interplanetary journey, although operating a spacecraft involves far greater precision. Our knowledge of where the spacecraft is and where it is heading is amazingly, fantastically, incredibly accurate, but it is not perfect. This point is essential. Keeping most spacecraft on course is a matter of frequently recalculating the position, speed, and direction of travel and then occasionally fine-tuning the trajectory through burns of the propulsion system. Dawn's near-constant use of its advanced ion propulsion system for most of 2008 changes the story, but only a little. The thrust plan was calculated before launch and then updated once our arrow was free of the bow. Throughout the interplanetary cruise phase, a new thrust plan was transmitted to the spacecraft about every 5 weeks, each time with slight updates to account for the latest calculations of Dawn's orbit around the Sun. With this method, the small adjustments to the trajectory have been incorporated into the large, preplanned changes. The mission control team requires about 5 weeks to design, develop, check, double-check, transmit, and activate a 5-week set of commands. By the time the spacecraft is executing the final part of those instructions, it is following a flight plan that is based on information from 10 weeks earlier. During most of the mission, when there are months or even years of thrusting ahead of it, subsequent opportunities to adjust the trajectory are plentiful. In contrast, for the last period of preplanned thrusting before Mars, controllers modified their normal process for formulating the commands, making a fast update for the final few days of thrusting. By including the latest navigational data in the computations for the direction and duration of the concluding segment of powered flight, the mission control team put Dawn on a more accurate course for Mars than it otherwise would have been. Even with this strategy, navigators recognized long ago that subsequent adjustments would be required. The plan for approaching Mars has always included windows for trajectory correction maneuvers. Dawn's first TCM occurred on November 20. As navigators refined their trajectory calculations after thrusting finished on October 31, they determined that the spacecraft was quite close to the aim point they wanted, but still not exactly on target. In fact, rather than being on a course to sail a few hundred kilometers above Mars, the probe's path would have taken it to the surface of the planet. Despite the power of the ion propulsion system, Dawn does not have the capability to bore through the rocky planet and continue on its way to Vesta. Such a situation is not surprising. Suppose in the archery, the bull's-eye were 30 centimeters in diameter, but we preferred to hit a point 2.2 centimeters outside the bull's-eye, near the 11:00 position. As our arrow approached the target, it might turn out that it was going to miss the target entirely, it might be headed for some other point on the target, and it just might be that it was headed for the bull's-eye itself. Dawn's case was this last one, so TCM1 put it on track for the destination we desired. Amazing sports analogies for the fantastic accuracy of interplanetary navigation usually fail to account for TCMs, as most arrows, balls, and other projectiles do not include active control after they are on their way. Your correspondent has presented his own simile for the astonishing accuracy with which a spacecraft can reach a faraway destination, but most such analogies neglect TCMs, without which deep-space missions could not be accomplished. For reasons we will not divulge, Dawn's first TCM has been designated TCM1. On November 20, just as it had for all of its previous thrusting, the spacecraft pointed a thruster in the required direction and resumed emitting the familiar blue-green beam of xenon ions to alter course. While typical thrusting during the mission has lasted for almost 7 days at a time, in this case only a short burn was necessary. Propelling itself from about 4:31 pm to 6:42 pm PST was just enough to fine-tune its course and change its speed by a bit more than 60 centimeters per second. This adjustment was modest indeed, as at that time Dawn was traveling around the Sun at more than 22.5 kilometers per second. Dawn and Mars, following their separate orbits that will intersect on February 17, 2009, were moving relative to each other at 3.17 kilometers per second. Dawn's second TCM window is in January. Traveling two-thirds of the way from here to Mars, the navigational accuracy then will be still better, with smaller deviations from the planned target point being detectable, so another refinement in the trajectory then is likely. In the meantime, Dawn will follow its orbital path with its ion thrusters idle. As Dawn travels through space on its own, its path has been essentially independent of Earth's. We saw in a previous log that the weaker grasp exerted by the Sun at Dawn's greater distance means that it travels more slowly around the solar system. While Earth has completed more than 1 full revolution since launch, Dawn has not yet rounded the Sun once. After receding from the Sun until early August, the spacecraft began falling back, albeit only temporarily. The probe attained its maximum distance from Earth on November 10. The spacecraft was more than 384 million kilometers from its one-time home. Although it will make substantial progress on its journey in the meantime, Dawn's distance to Earth will continue to decrease until January 2010, when it will be less than one-third of what it is today. In the summer of that year, however, as Earth maintains its repetitive annual orbital motion and the explorer climbs away from the Sun, it will surpass this month's distance to Earth. The complex choreography of the solar system's grand orbital dance rarely calls for a circular orbit; rather, the dancers follow ellipses around the Sun. Thanks to the details of the shapes of their orbits, the greatest separation between Earth and Dawn did not occur when they were precisely on opposite sides of the Sun, although the alignment was close to that. On December 12, their dance steps will take them to points almost exactly on opposite sides of the Sun. For observers on Earth, this is known as solar conjunction, because the spacecraft and the Sun will appear to be in the same location. In reality, of course, Dawn will be much farther away than Earth's star. It will be 147 million kilometers from Earth to the Sun but 379 million kilometers from the planet to its cosmic envoy. Its apparent proximity to the Sun presents a helpful opportunity for terrestrial readers to locate Dawn in the sky. On December 9 - 15, the spacecraft will be less than 1 degree from the Sun, progressing from east to west and passing just 1/3 degree south of that brilliant celestial landmark on December 12. The Sun itself is 1/2 degree across, so this is close indeed; the spacecraft will sneak in to less than 1 solar diameter from the disk. To demonstrate how small the separation is, if you blocked the Sun with your thumb at arm's length during this week around conjunction, you also would cover Dawn. For those interested observers who lack the requisite superhuman visual acuity to discern the remote spacecraft amidst the dazzling light of the Sun, conjunction still may provide a convenient occasion to reflect upon this most recent of humankind's missions far into the solar system. This small probe is the product of creatures fortunate enough to be able to combine their powerful curiosity about the workings of the cosmos with their impressive abilities to explore, investigate, and ultimately understand. While its builders remain in the vicinity of the planet upon which they evolved, their robotic ambassador now is passing on the far side of the extraordinarily distant Sun. This is the same Sun that has been the unchallenged master of our solar system for 4.5 billion years. This is the same Sun that has shone down on Earth throughout that time and has been the ultimate source of so much of the heat, light, and other energy upon which the planet's inhabitants have been so dependent. This is the same Sun that has so influenced human expression in art, literature, and religion for uncounted millennia. This is the same Sun that has motivated scientific studies for centuries. This is the same Sun that acts as our signpost in the Milky Way galaxy. This is the same Sun that is more than 100 times the diameter of Earth and a third of a million times the planet's mass. And humans have a spacecraft on the far side of it. We may be humbled by our own insignificance in the universe, yet we still undertake the most valiant adventures in our attempts to comprehend its majesty. Solar conjunction means even more to Dawn mission controllers than the opportunity to meditate upon what magnificent feats our species can achieve. As Earth, the Sun, and the spacecraft come closer into alignment, radio signals that go back and forth must pass near the Sun. The solar environment is fierce indeed, and it causes interference in those radio waves. While some signals will get through, communications will be less reliable. Therefore, controllers plan to send no messages to the spacecraft from December 5 through December 18; all instructions needed during that time will be stored onboard beforehand. Deep Space Network antennas, pointing near the Sun, will listen through the roaring noise for the faint whisper of the spacecraft, but the team will consider any signals to be a bonus. There is plenty of other work to do while waiting to resume communications after conjunction. In addition to preparing for the visit to Mars, engineers will continue to interpret the results of election day. On November 4, the Dawn team voted unanimously for more power. They commanded the spacecraft to execute a set of steps to yield data that will reveal the full potential of the enormous solar arrays to generate electrical power. The method was tested first on July 21, and then refined for a test on September 22. For this month's measurement, the commands were identical to those used for the second test with one exception that had been planned from the beginning: the solar arrays were rotated to point 60 degrees away from the Sun instead of 45 degrees. The solar arrays are so powerful that when they are pointed directly at the Sun, the spacecraft could not draw enough power to measure their full capability. The data collected show the electrical behavior of the arrays as the ion propulsion system was commanded through its start-up, drawing more and more power. Unlike the two tests, this calibration was designed so that with the arrays pointed so far from the Sun, they would not be able to provide as much power as was requested. Engineers wanted to find the point at which the arrays would no longer be able to satisfy the demands. They were not disappointed; power climbed up and up until no more was available. The prospect of having a spacecraft not be able to meet its own power demands may seem risky, but the procedure was carefully designed, analyzed, and simulated, and it executed perfectly. When the ion propulsion system asked for more power than the arrays could deliver, in the language of the trade, the solar arrays \"collapsed.\" Now to some, this suggests something not entirely desirable, such as 2 bent and twisted wings, each with 5 warped panels, and 11,480 shattered solar cells, the fragments sparkling in the sunlight as they tumbled and floated away from the powerless probe. In this case though, \"collapse\" is an electrical, not a mechanical, phenomenon and hence would be somewhat less visually spectacular and quite reversible -- a key attribute for a mission with well over 6 years of space exploration ahead of it. Once all the data are analyzed, controllers will have a better prediction for how much power the arrays will be able to generate for the rest of the voyage. Dawn is 20 million kilometers from Mars. It is 383 million kilometers from Earth, or 950 times as far as the moon and 2.59 times as far as the Sun.

NASA officials working on the Dawn mission, which is designed to unlock secrets of how the solar system formed, shut down the spacecraft's engines last week as part of a planned maneuver during its 3-billion-mile journey to the asteroid Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres. For Mark Sykes, director of the Tucson-based Planetary Science Institute and a Dawn co-investigator, shutting down the spacecraft's ion engines is just another sign that the mission is on schedule for its encounter with Vesta in 2011. \"All the systems are working extremely well, including the ion thrusters,\" Sykes said. \"It's a good achievement for us to demonstrate that this technology can work in this context.\"", "url": "https://tucson.com/news/local/education/college/dawn-mission-on-track-to-find-how-planets-form/article_0f507474-b894-56cd-8869-6848b2ab5ea1.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Spacecraft Falling For Mars", "date": "2009-02-12", "content": "Launched in September of 2007, and propelled by any one of a trio of hyper-efficient ion engines, NASA's Dawn spacecraft passed the orbit of Mars last summer. At that time, the asteroid belt (where Dawn's two targets, asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres reside), had never been closer. In early July the spacecraft began to lose altitude, falling back towards the inner solar system. Then on October 31, 2008, after 270 days of almost continuous thrusting, the ion drive turned off. \"Not only are our thrusters off and we are dropping in altitude, we are plunging toward Mars,\" said Marc Rayman, the Dawn project's chief engineer from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"And everybody here on Dawn could not be happier.\" The team's joy at plummeting towards a planet named for the Roman god of war is not unfounded. Mars, the final stop for many a NASA spacecraft, was always an important, and weighty, waypoint for the Dawn mission. It all has to do with one of the heavy subjects of rocket science, gravity assists. A gravity assist is the use of the relative movement and gravity of a planet or other celestial body to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft, typically in order to save fuel, time and expense. A spacecraft traveling to an outer planet (or in this case asteroid) will decelerate because the incessant tug of the sun's gravity slows it down. By flying a spacecraft close by a large planet and its large gravity field, some of the planet's speed as it orbits the sun is transferred to the spacecraft. In Dawn's case, it is using the Red Planet's tremendous angular momentum (the speed at which Mars orbits the sun) to give it a little extra oomph. \"A big oomph actually,\" said Rayman. \"The gravity of Mars will change Dawn's path about the sun, enlarging its elliptical orbit and sending the probe farther from the sun. It will also change Dawn's orbital plane by more than 5 degrees. This is important because Dawn has to maneuver into the same plane in which Vesta orbits the sun.\" If Dawn had to perform these orbital adjustments on its own with no Mars gravitational deflection, it would have required the spacecraft to fire up its engines and change velocity by more than 5,800 miles per hour (9,330 kilometers per hour). Such velocity changes would have required Dawn to carry an extra 230 pounds (104 kilograms) of xenon fuel. \"Without the gravity assist, our mission would not have been affordable, even with the extraordinary capability of the ion propulsion system,\" said Rayman. \"That's why we are happy Dawn is now plunging toward Mars.\" Also happy for the opportunity to fly past the fourth rock from the sun is Dawn's science team. With asteroid Vesta still more than two-and-a-half years away, Mars provides the perfect opportunity to give their highly-tuned instruments a workout. \"It is fortuitous that we need Mars to get out to Vesta and Ceres,\" said Carol Raymond, Dawn's deputy principal investigator, from JPL. \"Since there are other spacecraft currently operating at Mars with similar instrumentation, we will be able to check our measurements against their knowledge of Mars, and carry that information farther out into the solar system.\" But the Mars gravity assist is not the final hurdle on Dawn's road to the asteroid belt. The subsequent 30 months include more than 27 months of blue-green tinged ion thrusting to successfully rendezvous with Dawn's first target Vesta. While an accurately flown encounter with the planet Mars makes a big difference in the life of NASA's asteroid pioneer, the planet itself does not come out unscathed. Weighing in at all of 2,500 pounds (1,134 kilograms), Dawn has its own mass and thereby its own gravitational field. In contrast, the somewhat more massive planet is almost 600 million-million-million times more substantial than that of the spacecraft. \"The laws of physics tell us that Mars will pay a price for helping Dawn,\" said Rayman. \"The flyby will cause Mars to slow in its orbit enough that after one year, its position will be off by about the width of an atom. If you add that up, it will take about 180 million years for Mars to be out of position by one inch (2.5 centimeters). We appreciate Mars making that sacrifice so Dawn can conduct its exciting mission of discovery in the asteroid belt.\" Dawn's 4.8-billion-kilometer (3-billion-mile) odyssey includes orbiting asteroid Vesta in 2011 and the dwarf planet Ceres in 2015. These two giants of the asteroid belt have been witness to much of our solar system's history. By using Dawn's instruments to study both objects for several months, scientists can more accurately compare and contrast the two. Dawn's science instrument suite will measure geology, elemental and mineral composition, shape, surface topography, geomorphology and tectonic history, and will also seek water-bearing minerals. In addition, the Dawn spacecraft's orbit characteristics around Vesta and Ceres will be used to measure the celestial bodies' masses and gravity fields. The Dawn mission to Vesta and Ceres is managed by JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The University of California, Los Angeles, is responsible for overall Dawn mission science.

The ion-powered spacecraft used the gravitational pull of Mars to slingshot around the planet and hurtle outward toward its next stop, the asteroid Vesta. The maneuver was expected to boost Dawn's speed by more than 5,800 mph and set the asteroid probe on track to reach Vesta in August 2011. \"Without the gravity assist, our mission would not have been affordable, even with the extraordinary capability of the ion propulsion system,\" said Marc Rayman, chief engineer for Dawn's mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Dawn use selectricity generated by its solar arrays to charge a stream of xenon gasparticles and fires the resulting ions out a nozzle to slowly build up speed asit flies through space. Ion engines allow spacecraft to fly farther using less fuel. Tuesday's Mars flyby was expected to give Dawn a power boost equivalent to about 230 pounds of xenon fuel. For comparison, Dawn's current setup allows itto fire its engines for more than 24 hours while consuming about 9 ounces of fuel. Dawn is expected to fire its engine for about 50,000 hours - more than any other spacecraft - by the end of its mission. Japan's asteroid probe Hayabusa, which reignited its xenon engine last month, has fired its ion drive for more than30,000 hours during its mission to the space rock Itokawa. Hayabusa is slowlyreturning to Earth to deliver a capsule that may contain samples of the Itokawaasteroid. Nextstop, Vesta: Launchedin 2007, Dawn is making its way toward Vesta and Ceres as part of a missionto better understand the formation of the solar system. The 3 billion-mile trip is expected to take about eight years, with Vesta, the probe's first target, still more than 2 1/2 years away. Vesta is alarge oblong asteroid with a rocky composition. Ceres, meanwhile, is round andthe largest space rock in the asteroid belt. Aboutthe size of Texas, it actually qualifies as a small dwarf planet. Dawncarries instruments to hunt for water-bearing minerals, as well as measure theshape, surface topography, tectonic history, elemental and mineral compositionof both targets. It is also expected to measure their masses and gravityfields. But first,Dawn has to actually reachVesta and Ceres, and to do that it needed the speed boost from Tuesday's flyby. Thespacecraft made its closest approach past Mars 7:28 p.m. EST, when it zoomed within 341 miles of the red planet. Missionscientists planned to use the rendezvous to test out Dawn?s cameras and otherinstruments as a sort of dress rehearsal for the Vesta encounter. But thereis a downside to Dawn's swing past Mars. Just as the probe nabbed a speed boostfrom the planet, the encounter slowed Mars by a tiny fraction, mission managers said. \"The flyby will cause Mars to slow in its orbit enough that after one year, itsposition will be off by about the width of an atom.

But if you were aboard that spacecraft right now, you'd be getting a spectacular view of the planet Mars. That's because, as I type this, Dawn is passing just 341 miles (549 km) from the Red Planet. During this brief encounter Mars's gravity will bend the craft's trajectory by 5\u00b0 and boost its velocity by about 2,500 miles per hour (1.1 km per second). Had Dawn not encountered Mars en route to the asteroid belt, it would have needed to carry an additional 230 pounds of xenon to fuel its super-efficient ion-powered engines. That would have been too much to bring along, nixing the mission plans. Mars does more than simply give Dawn a swift kick onward - it provides a handy calibration target for the craft's three scientific instruments: a visible-light camera, a visible and infrared mapping spectrometer, and a gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer nicknamed GRaND. (A press release about GRaND's activities is here.) Because Dawn's approach path is on the dark side of Mars, the best tourist snapshots will come right after the flyby. (For a complete timeline of what happens when, read the interesting and informative online blog written by project manager Marc Raymond.) But don't expect to see images beamed to Earth right away. To pan across the planet's amazing ocher plains, eons-old craters, and other features, Dawn has had to pivot away from its alignment with Earth. It'll return to its normal cruise attitude and reestablish high-rate communication in a couple of days, when the pretty pictures will start streaming home. Then, on February 20th, Dawn swings back to view Mars one more time.

The spacecraft is healthy and coasting, keeping its main antenna pointed to Earth, as it will for most of the next 3 months. After that, it will resume its familiar routine of devoting most of the time to gently thrusting with its ion propulsion system, with only a short period each week for communications. Following the last log, as the probe succumbed to the gravitational pull of the red planet, its trajectory gradually began to change. Flying true to the plan, Dawn swooped close to Mars and then left it behind on a new course, having taken advantage of Mars's gravity. The spacecraft plunged to within 542 kilometers of the planet, reaching that lowest altitude at 4:27:58 pm PST on February 17. The last time it had been so close to another solar system body was on September 27, 2007, as it left Earth to begin its long journey to the asteroid belt. In the intervening time, it traveled alone for 1.06 billion kilometers. The targeting of the encounter was well within acceptable limits. Before embarking on the mission, long before launch, engineers chose 500 kilometers as a convenient initial target altitude for planning purposes. With the extraordinary capability of the ion propulsion system, Dawn easily could accommodate significant deviations from the plan. To accomplish its mission, the probe needed to fly anywhere through a window shaped liked a croquet wicket, extending from more than 750 kilometers above the planet down to 300 kilometers. The width at the bottom of the wicket was almost 670 kilometers. In an effort to broaden our readership beyond only those sentient beings in the universe who share in the passion for the exploration of the solar system, the November and January logs included some material for anyone passionate about archery. We compared Dawn's flight by Mars to shooting an arrow at a target 47 kilometers away. The objective was to hit a small region just outside the 30-centimeter red bull's-eye. For the readers who have joined us because of that topic, we return to it once again here. Our original target altitude of 500 kilometers corresponded to about 17.2 centimeters from the center of the bull's-eye. Using navigational data from January, we predicted Dawn would fly by at 543 kilometers above the surface, the arrow sinking into the target about 17.4 centimeters from the center, just outside the red circle. Now we know that that prediction was in error by the equivalent of about 40 micrometers. The arrow was off from that expected location by about the thickness of a hair. The location of the original target was at the 11:00 position, but the base of the wicket-shaped window extended from where the hour hand would be at 10:51:02 to 11:03:49. As a reminder, because we are concerned only about the hour hand, the tick marks adjacent to the 11:00 position correspond to 10:48 and 11:12, so this wicket is very narrow. In January, it appeared our arrow was headed for about 11:03:42. In fact, the actual trajectory took the spacecraft through the window at the 11:03:40 position. The gravity assist was extremely accurate indeed. The archers hit their target and won the big prize: the continuation of the mission of exploration in the asteroid belt, seeking answers to questions about the dawn of the solar system. In addition to the gravity assist, which was essential to the success of the mission, the operations team had devised a plan to acquire some bonus data to aid in the calibration of the science instruments, as described last month. In order to point its instruments at their calibration targets, the probe oriented itself for a short time in such a way that light reflected from Mars reached its \"star tracker\". This unit tracks stars in order to help the attitude control system establish the spacecraft's orientation in the zero-gravity of spaceflight. The tracker's camera images stars and its internal computer recognizes patterns, much as you might recognize some of the lovely constellations visible from your planet and use them to orient yourself at night. When Mars light entered the star tracker, the camera was dazzled, temporarily unable to see the stars. If you reside on a planet with a large moon, you may have experienced a similar phenomenon. It is much harder to see stars when the bright moon interferes. Engineers had anticipated this behavior. Because they knew the star tracker likely would be unable to provide useful data to the attitude control system for a while, gyroscopes had been powered on well beforehand. Using these spinning masses, attitude control can sense turns and keep track of how the attitude changes even when the star tracker is not yielding accurate information. As another preventive measure, commands stored on board temporarily precluded protective software, known as fault protection, from seeing any alerts indicating that the star tracker was not able to produce valid data. Because they expected the data to be invalid, engineers did not want fault protection to respond under the mistaken impression that the tracker was unhealthy. As Dawn approached Mars, with instruments powered and beginning their calibrations, the light reached the star tracker, but it performed better than expected. After reaching its minimum distance, as the spacecraft rotated during its ascent, the star tracker's line of sight moved closer still to Mars. Almost 2 minutes after the closest approach, the device finally was overwhelmed with light and reported that it could not track stars, declaring itself to be nonoperational and causing a software flag to be hoisted to alert interested parties. As planned, attitude control relied on gyros and fault protection remained blind to the alert. About 11 minutes later, as the spacecraft's attitude continued to change, the star tracker's view moved far enough from Mars that the unit once again could discern stars. When it recognized patterns, it reported its data to attitude control, which readily used them. All was well, and the tracker had functioned better than anticipated, identifying stars with Mars closer to its line of sight than anticipated. Another 7 minutes after that, as Dawn's momentum continued to carry it away from Mars, the stored command to restore fault protection's ability to see any star tracker problems was executed. The star tracker was indeed working well, but the compulsive reader will note that the chronology above does not include lowering the virtual flag that was raised when the tracker announced it had stopped tracking stars. A software bug, hardy enough to elude the operations team and survive the rigors of the deep-space environment, prevented the flag from coming back down when the tracker resumed normal operation. Although attitude control was making good use of the data, when fault protection saw the flag, it fulfilled its function; treating the tracker as if it were unhealthy, the protective software deactivated the unit. Fault protection's next step was to try to use the backup star tracker. Another bug, identified last year while the spacecraft was in flight, deprived the second tracker of the time necessary to complete its activation routine. With no star tracker available, fault protection correctly followed the plan its designers had given it: it interrupted the calibrations, powered off the instruments, and put the spacecraft into \"safe mode,\" awaiting instructions from Earth on what to do next. The operations team, following events on distant Earth, observed the signature of safe mode. There was no urgency in responding, however, because the instrument calibrations could not be restarted, and the crucial gravity assist was unaffected by the spacecraft's activities. Mars would sling Dawn in the intended direction without regard for the probe's actions. The cause of the \"safing\" was quickly determined, and the team returned the spacecraft to its normal operational configuration within about 2 days. In addition, all the bonus calibration data that the instruments had transferred to the spacecraft's main computer before they were deactivated were transmitted to Earth. The gamma ray and neutron detector obtained excellent measurements of both gamma rays and neutrons from Mars. The instrument has been operated a number of times in flight to measure high- energy radiation that pervades space as it strikes the spacecraft, but, unlike the other science sensors onboard, it can detect bodies only when it is very close to them. Dawn's other instruments have observed distant planets and stars several times already, but that is not possible for GRaND, even with its suite of sophisticated detectors. Mars is the only occasion in the mission for it to observe a specific, well-characterized object. It was powered on in January in anticipation of this opportunity. GRaND obtained a thorough set of data as Dawn traveled down to its lowest point, despite being over the night side of the planet part of that time, because it does not require illumination by the Sun to \"see\" its subject. It acquired additional valuable data as the spacecraft receded from Mars. This was GRaND's only measurement of a planetary body; and, apart from being quite brief, it was performed in much the same way it will be when Dawn orbits each of its protoplanetary destinations. It was especially good fortune that space radiation levels were relatively low during the encounter with Mars, making the radiation escaping from the atmosphere and surface particularly clear for GRaND. Scientists will compare GRaND's data with measurements of gamma rays and neutrons by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft, helping them prepare for interpreting the unique observations it will make of Vesta and Ceres to reveal many of the atomic constituents of those protoplanets. The visible and infrared spectrometer's data were not stored in the spacecraft's main computer memory before the safing because the camera's data had priority. One of the images the camera acquired is shown here. With the benefit of an excellent gravity assist, the Dawn project is gratified to have Mars behind and Vesta now so clearly ahead. Having obtained even more than was needed from the red planet, Dawn is ever more eager to press on to its destinations in the asteroid belt. Dawn is 4.1 million kilometers from Mars. It is 336 million kilometers from Earth, or 915 times as far as the moon and 2.26 times as far as the Sun. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take 37 minutes to make the round trip. Dr. Marc D. Rayman 3:00 am PDT March 8, 2009 P.S.

Universe Today finally had the chance to catch up with the team from the Dawn mission following this maneuver to find out how things went, and how the spacecraft is doing following the gravity assist operations. \"The gravity assist accomplished exactly what we needed to get on course for Vesta,\" Dawn Chief Engineer Marc Rayman told UT. \"In addition to the gravity assist, we decided to undertake some bonus instrument calibrations, taking advantage of flying by such a well-studied planet. In doing so, we obtained some performance data on some of our instruments.\" The image seen here of Mars' surface is one of the results of those calibrations. Dawn will be visiting two different asteroids, Vesta and Ceres. Because of its distinctive ion engine, the spacecraft will be able to enter orbit around Vesta in August of 2011, remain there until May of 2012, then leave orbit and head to Ceres, arriving in February of 2015. The thrusters work by using an electrical charge to accelerate ions from xenon fuel to a speed 10 times that of chemical engines. But what does this mean for a gravity assist - is there any difference between an ion engine versus and a chemical thruster in a gravity assist? \"In most ways, there is no difference,\" said Rayman. \"We used the ion thruster to get on course for the gravity assist, but the spacecraft coasted for most of the 4.5 months before it reached Mars. When we had to refine the trajectory, we used the ion thruster because it is so much more efficient than conventional propulsion. Moreover, because the ion propulsion affords so much flexibility in the mission, we did not have to hit as small a 'window' at Mars.\"", "url": "https://www.universetoday.com/27012/dawn-spacecraft-on-target-for-vesta-following-gravity-assist/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "", "date": "2009-09-27", "content": "Dawn is celebrating the second anniversary of leaving its home planet by engaging in the same function it has performed most of its time in space: with the utmost patience, it is using its ion propulsion system to gradually modify its orbit around the Sun. In its interplanetary travels, the spacecraft has thrust for a total of about 389 days, or 53% of the time. While for most spacecraft, firing a thruster to change course is a special event, it is Dawn's wont. All this thrusting has cost the craft only 103 kilograms of its supply of xenon propellant, which was 425 kilograms on September 27, 2007. The thrusting so far in the mission has achieved the equivalent of accelerating the probe by 2.62 kilometers per second. As previous logs have described, because of the principles of motion for orbital flight, whether around the Sun or any other gravitating body, Dawn is not actually traveling this much faster than when it launched. But the effective change in speed remains a useful measure of the effect of any spacecraft's propulsive work. Having accomplished only one-fifth of the thrust time planned for its entire mission, Dawn has already far exceeded the velocity change achieved by most spacecraft. .) Since launch, our readers who have remained on or near Earth have completed 2 revolutions around the Sun, covering about 1.88 billion kilometers. Orbiting farther from the Sun, and moving at a more leisurely pace, Dawn has traveled 1.57 billion kilometers. As it climbs away from the Sun to match its orbit to that of Vesta, it will continue to slow down to Vesta's speed. Since Dawn's launch, Vesta has traveled only 1.18 billion kilometers. Readers with nothing better to do have already discovered that much of the text in the 3 preceding paragraphs is taken verbatim from the log that commemorated Dawn's first anniversary of being in space, with the principal changes being that the numbers are updated here.. This is not a result of any more otiosity than normally displayed by your correspondent; rather, comparing the beginning of this log with last year's may be helpful for measuring the progress in the intervening time. Of course, most of the last 12 months was devoted to coasting, and the gravitational boost from Mars is not reflected in the effect of the ion thrusting, but the comparison may be illuminating for some readers. This also provides a handy preview of the beginning of the September 27, 2010 log. Note to self: Perhaps there really is an option here for greater lassitude. Think about that after taking a nap. Another way to investigate the progress of the mission is to chart how Dawn's orbit around the Sun has changed. This discussion will culminate with a few more numbers than we usually include, and readers who prefer not to indulge may skip this material, leaving that much more for the grateful Numerivores. Orbits are ellipses. So as members of the solar system family follow their paths around the Sun, they sometimes move closer and sometimes move farther from it. For thinking about these distances, we may remind ourselves once again of the convenient unit of measure in the solar system, the astronomical unit. In addition to orbits being characterized by shape, or equivalently by the amount of flattening, and by size, they may be described in part by how they are oriented in space. Using the bias of terrestrial astronomers, the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun is a good reference. Other planets and interplanetary spacecraft travel in orbits that are tipped at some angle to that. Vesta and Ceres do not orbit the Sun in the same plane that Earth does, and Dawn must match its orbit to that of its targets. Now we can see how Dawn has been doing by considering the size and shape and the angle of its orbit on its anniversaries. The table below shows what the orbit would be if the spacecraft terminated thrusting on its anniversaries; the orbits of its destinations, Vesta and Ceres, are included for comparison. Of course, when Dawn was on the launch pad on September 27, 2007, its orbit around the Sun was exactly Earth's orbit. After launch, it had its own orbit. Readers may disregard the table or gaze into it for insight or inspiration for as long as they like. The point of it, however, is to illustrate both that Dawn has come a long way since the launch pad, and it has a long journey ahead before it begins its exploration of Vesta. But the trek will be a little shorter than mission planners had anticipated until quite recently. As we have seen in a previous log, the plan for thrusting depends on how much electrical power will be available to the ion propulsion system, which converts electrical power into thrusting power. Greater electrical power translates into higher thrust. Last year Dawn's engineers, who remain on distant Earth, devised a method to calibrate the solar arrays, and the spacecraft dutifully carried it out. The resulting data, combined with an extensive refinement of the mathematical model that predicts solar array power, allowed the team to be confident in increasing the prediction of the future availability of power by up to 10%. Equipped with this crucial information, they could update the plan for thrusting. Many other factors affect the design of the thrust profile as well. As one example, how effective the thrust is depends on how massive the spacecraft is. Although weightless, Dawn still has mass, and the greater the mass, the lower the acceleration provided by the ion thruster. This phenomenon is no different from what readers experience frequently even in the gravity of their home planet. The heavier the load you carry, the more gradually you will accelerate, whether the effort is exerted by the muscles in your legs or the engine in your car. Dawn's mass decreases as the mission progresses because the ion propulsion system expends xenon and the reaction control system expends hydrazine. By refining predictions for how much of these propellants will be onboard at all times for the rest of the mission, engineers could predict how long it will take Dawn to propel itself into the same orbit around the Sun as Vesta and then later into the same orbit as Ceres. After an extended set of analyses late in 2008 and the first half of 2009, all the elements needed to update the thrust plan were in place. The seemingly modest improvement in solar array power is by far the dominant one. When all were combined, the result revealed that Dawn's remarkable maneuvering capability over the course of the mission will be even better than engineers had been counting on. The probe will be able to reach Vesta about 6 weeks earlier than had previously been planned. Moreover, the newfound capability will enable the craft to travel from Vesta to Ceres more quickly, so the deadline for leaving the first world to reach the second on schedule in 2015 is about 6 weeks later. Together, these changes allow the explorer to increase its planned 9-month stay at Vesta to 12 months. This is of extraordinary benefit to the project. Vesta promises to be a fascinating place to visit, and we know quite well from other solar system adventures that no matter how much data we collect, there is always still more to learn. Mission planners had been working hard to squeeze as much as possible into the precious time they expected Dawn could spend at Vesta, so being able to increase the duration of its residency there by a third makes a tremendous difference. As details continue to be formulated for all the activities necessary to operate at and study this alien world, the additional time will prove extremely valuable in allowing the team to accommodate the glitches that are inevitable in such a complex expedition and to uncover as much of Vesta's intriguing story as possible. Dawn is already following the new flight plan, targeting where Vesta will be in July 2011. It is not enough, though, just for them to be in the same place at the same time. That would result in a flyby, but our probe will enter orbit around the protoplanet, accompanying it on its orbit around the Sun, just as satellites of Earth remain close by throughout the planet's solar orbit. The craft will remain with Vesta until July 2012, when it will begin thrusting to Ceres. We have discussed before why flying by is significantly less challenging than matching orbits, a capability that would be essentially impossible without the ion propulsion system. A subsequent log will delve further into this issue, as it is a fundamental feature of this ambitious mission. As Dawn begins its third year in space, now on its new and better course, much work remains before it can return the scientific bounty it seeks. We hope readers will continue to follow the progress of this bold adventure in the exciting years to come. Dawn is 1.50 AU from Earth, or 555 times as far as the moon and 1.50 times as far as the Sun. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take 25 minutes to make the round trip. Dr. Marc D. Rayman 4:34 am PDT September 27, 2009 P.S. The astronomical unit has been mentioned in these logs frequently enough that we will include that convenient unit of measurement from now on in the famously unimaginative concluding paragraph. It might appear redundant to present the distance from Earth both in astronomical units and in terms of how many times as far as the Sun it is. Isn't that simply 2 different ways to describe exactly the same quantity? Well, no it is not; they are different, although they are close. An astronomical unit is the average distance between Earth and the Sun and hence does not change. The actual distance varies slightly throughout the year, so Earth's distance from the Sun at any given time may not be precisely the average value of 1.00000000 AU. This would be more apparent if your correspondent did not round off the numbers as dramatically. The details on that closing text are that Dawn is 1.50456971 AU from Earth. At the same time, Earth is 1.00222102 AU from the Sun, very close to the average, but not exactly equal to it. So Dawn is 1.50123544 times as far from Earth as the Sun is, given the distance to the Sun now. When rounded off, the distance in astronomical units and the distance in terms of how far the Sun is both come out to 1.50, but we see they are not really equal. Other times of the year, when the actual distance to the Sun is farther from the average, the difference will be apparent. As long as these secrets of the final paragraph are being revealed, here are the rest: the distance relative to the moon is rounded to the nearest multiple of 5, and the travel time for radio signals to the nearest minute. But just for this special occasion: Dawn is 556.865373 times as far as the moon right now, and radio signals take 25 minutes 1.574966 seconds. Approximately.

The previous standard-bearer for velocity change, NASA's Deep Space 1, also impelled by ion propulsion, was the first interplanetary spacecraft to use this technology. The Deep Space 1 record fell on Saturday, June 5, when the Dawn spacecraft's accumulated acceleration over the mission exceeded 4.3 kilometers per second (9,600 miles per hour). \"We are using this amazing ion-engine technology as a stepping-stone to orbit and explore two of the asteroid belt's most mysterious objects, Vesta and Ceres,\" said Robert Mase, Dawn project manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. A spacecraft's change in velocity refers to its ability to change its path through space by using its own rocket engines. This measurement of change begins only after the spacecraft exits the last stage of the launch vehicle that hurled it into space. To get to where it is in both the record books and the asteroid belt, the Dawn spacecraft had to fire its three engines - one at a time-- for a cumulative total of 620 days. In that time, it has used less than 165 kilograms (363 pounds) of xenon propellant. Over the course of its eight-plus-year mission, Dawn's three ion engines are expected to accumulate 2,000 days of operation -- 5.5 years of thrusting -- for a total change in velocity of more than 38,620 kilometers per hour (24,000 miles per hour). \"I am delighted that it will be Dawn that surpasses DS1's record,\" said Marc Rayman, chief engineer for the Dawn mission and a previous project manager for Deep Space 1. \"It is a tribute to all those involved in the design and operations of this remarkable spacecraft.\" At first glance, Dawn's pedal-to-the-metal performance is a not-so-inspiring 0-to-97 kilometers per hour (0-to-60 miles per hour) in four days. But due to its incredible efficiency, it expends only 37 ounces of xenon propellant during that time. Then take into consideration that after those four days of full-throttle thrusting, it will do another four days, and then another four. By the end of 12 days, the spacecraft will have increased its velocity by more than 290 kilometers per hour (180 miles per hour), with more days and weeks and months of continuous thrusting to come. In one year's time, Dawn's ion propulsion system can increase the spacecraft's speed by 8,850 kilometers per hour (5,500 miles per hour), while consuming the equivalent of only 16 gallons of fuel. \"This is a special moment for the spacecraft team,\" said Dawn's principal investigator, Chris Russell of the University of California Los Angeles. \"In only 407 days, our minds will be on another set of records, the data records that Dawn will transmit when we enter Vesta orbit.\" Dawn's 4.8-billion-kilometer (3-billion-mile) odyssey includes exploration of asteroid Vesta in 2011 and 2012, and the dwarf planet Ceres in 2015. These two icons of the asteroid belt have been witness to much of our solar system's history. By using the same set of instruments at two separate destinations, scientists can more accurately formulate comparisons and contrasts. Dawn's science instrument suite will measure shape, surface topography and tectonic history, elemental and mineral composition, as well as seek out water-bearing minerals. In addition, the way the Dawn spacecraft orbits both Vesta and Ceres will be used to measure the celestial bodies' masses and gravity fields. While Dawn surpassed Deep Space 1's record for velocity change, Deep Space 1 will continue to reign as holder for the longest duration of powered spaceflight for another few months.

The malfunction occurred June 17 and knocked out one of Dawn's four attitude control reaction wheels used to orient the spacecraft as it flies toward thetwo biggest asteroids in the solar system. Dawn's mission is aimed at exploring the asteroid Vesta in 2011 and 2012 and dwarf planet Ceres - which is also the solar system's largest asteroid - in 2015. Currently, the problem is not expected to throw Dawn off its asteroid rendezvous schedule, NASA mission managers said. \"We're looking at the data carefully in order to understand what the long- termprospects are for this reaction wheel,\" said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"In the meantime, we're continuing our planned activities with the spacecraft.\" Typically three of the four wheels spin at any given time. Different spinning speed sallow the spacecraft to hold steady or rotate as needed. The problem arose when \"all members of the team but the insomniacs and the spacecraft itself were slumbering,\" Rayman wrote in a Sunday mission blog entry. Automatic sensors detected an unusual excess of friction building up on reaction wheel No. 4, and shut it down accordingly. Engineers have mostly ruled out the friction buildup being the result of a new software update, reactivation of the spacecraft or a recent velocity change. Such a problem would normally have prompted Dawn to activate its unused reaction wheelas a replacement. But all four reaction wheels had already been operating because the spacecraft had entered safe mode.

The 12-inch-wide ion thrusters provide less thrust than conventional engines, but they will provide propulsion for years during the mission and provide far greater capability to change velocity. \"We feel a little like Columbus approaching the shores of the New World,\" said Christopher Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \"The Dawn team can't wait to start mapping this terra incognita.\" Dawn previously navigated by measuring the radio signal between the spacecraft and Earth, and used other methods that did not involve Vesta.

Dawn is now halfway through its final approach to Vesta and has been snapping photos of the space rock with its navigation camera. \"Our destination is within sight, and this team is very excited that we're finally closing in on Vesta,\" said Robert Mase, Dawn project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The huge space rock's gravity will capture Dawn into orbit on July 16, when about 9,900 miles separate the pair. At that point, the probe and the asteroid will both be about 117 million miles from Earth. Unlike many other spacecraft that go into orbit around other worlds, this capture won't require any dramatic maneuvers or last-minute burns, researchers said. Dawn has been using its low-thrust ion propulsion system to close in on Vesta's orbit slowly but surely, so it should slip nicely into orbit on July 16. Many researchers classify Vesta as a protoplanet. In the early days of the solar system, it was well on its way to becoming a full-fledged rocky planet - like Earth or Mars - before Jupiter's huge gravity stirred things up in the asteroid belt, preventing further growth, researchers said. Scientists are interested in Vesta partly because it's so big, and partly because it was one of the first rocky bodies to form in our cosmic neighborhood, researchers said. \"The surface of Vesta will hold a record of the earliest history of the solar system,\" said Dawn principal investigator Christopher Russell of UCLA. During its year at Vesta, Dawn will map the asteroid's surface in detail, characterize its topography and mineralogy and study its gravitational field. It will do this from several different orbits, ranging from 1,700 miles above Vesta's cratered surface to just 120 miles. The information Dawn gathers should help scientists learn a great deal about Vesta's formation and geological history, researchers said. \"The Dawn team is going to, over the next year, enable us to get a bird's-eye view of this new world. Until now, it's only been a fuzzy blob,\" Adams said. \"The Dawn team will paint a face on that fuzzy blob.\" Dawn's work won't be done when it finishes its year at Vesta. In July 2012, it will depart the space rock and head to an even bigger body: the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt. Dawn should arrive at the 605-mile-wide Ceres in early 2015, researchers said. The spacecraft's observations will allow scientists to compare and contrast the two giant bodies, which have been shaped by different forces, researchers said. But for now, mission scientists are focusing on Vesta, which is just now starting to come into focus for the first time. \"This is an unprecedented opportunity to spend a year at a body that we really know nothing about,\" said Carol Raymond, Dawn deputy principal investigator at JPL. \"We're literally on the edge of our seats, waiting for this data to come in.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/12062-nasa-dawn-vesta-asteroid-update.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Search Is On for Moon Around Asteroid Vesta", "date": "2011-07-11", "content": "The debate over whether the giant asteroid Vesta has a moon could soon be decided. NASA's Dawn spacecraft will go into orbit in mid-July, when it will take the best-ever photographs of the big rock. Those photographs will give scientists the best evidence yet for or against the existence of a moon around Vesta. You might think of asteroids as isolated bodies tumbling alone through space, but it's entirely possible for these old \"loners\" to have companions. Indeed, 19-mile-wide asteroid Ida, 90-mile-wide Pulcova, 103-mile-wide Kalliope, and 135-mile-wide Eugenia each have a moon. And 175-mile-wide Sylvia has two moons. Measuring 330 miles across, Vesta is much larger than these other examples, so a \"Vesta moon\" is certainly plausible. Where do such moons come from? The Dawn spacecraft's chief engineer Marc Rayman suggests one possible source of a moon around Vesta: \"When another large body collides with an asteroid, the resulting debris is sprayed into orbit around the asteroid and can gradually collapse to form a moon,\" Rayman said in a statement. Another possibility is a game of \"gravitational pinball,\" such as when a moon formed elsewhere in the asteroid belt might, through complicated gravitational interactions with various bodies, end up captured by the gravity of one of them. The Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes have looked for Vesta moons before, and so far seen nothing. But Dawn is about to be in position for a closer look. This Saturday, just one week before Dawn goes into orbit around Vesta, the moon hunt will commence. Dawn's cameras will begin taking images of the space surrounding the asteroid, looking for suspicious specks, as it approaches. \"If a moon is there, it will appear as a dot that moves around Vesta in successive images as opposed to remaining fixed, like background stars,\" says Dawn team member Mark Sykes. \"We'll be able to use short exposures to detect moons as small as 27 meters 89 feet in diameter. If our longer exposures aren't washed out by the glare of nearby Vesta, we'll be able to detect moons only a few meters in diameter.\" Moon watching: While you won't see \"find a moon\" among the mission's science goals, a moon- sighting would be a nice feather in Dawn's cap. Not that it will need more feathers. The probe is already primed to build global maps and take detailed images of the asteroid's surface, reveal the fine points of its topography, and catalog the minerals and elements present there. Besides, Dawn will become a moon itself when it enters orbit around Vesta. And the probe's motions as it circles will provide a lot of information about the rocky relic. \"We'll use the spacecraft's radio signal to measure its motion around Vesta,\" Sykes said. \"This will give us a lot of detailed information about the asteroid's gravitational field. We'll learn about Vesta's mass and interior structure, including its core and potential mascons .\" Today, the spacecraft is steadily gaining on its target. And with the images taken on this approach to asteroid Vesta, a never-before-seen world grows ever larger and clearer. \"The pictures are beginning to reveal the surface of this battered, alien world,\" Rayman said. \"They're more than enough to tantalize us. We've been in flight for four years, we've been planning the mission for a decade, and people have been looking at Vesta in the night sky for two centuries. Now, finally, we're coming close up to it, and we'll be getting an intimate view of this place.\" Into the unknown: This is not only the first time a spacecraft has visited this alien world, it's also the first time a spacecraft has visited a massive body we haven't approached previously in a short flyby mission. \"In each case, flyby missions occurred first, providing a good estimate of the target's gravity along with information on other aspects of its physical environment, including whether any moons are present,\" Rayman said. \"This time we're much less certain what we'll find.\" At a recent press conference, NASA Planetary Science Deputy Director Jim Adams told reporters that Dawn will \"paint a face on a world seen only as a 'fuzzy blob' up to now.\" What does Rayman think Vesta's face will look like? \"Wrinkled, ancient, wizened, with a tremendous amount of character that bears witness to some fascinating episodes in the solar system's history,\" he said. If a new moon is among the episodes, Rayman has a name in mind. \"How about 'Dawn'?\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/12220-vesta-asteroid-moon-nasa-dawn-search.html"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft to Enter Asteroid's Orbit on July 15", "date": "2011-07-14", "content": "On July 15, NASA's Dawn spacecraft will begin a prolonged encounter with the asteroid Vesta, making the mission the first to enter orbit around a main-belt asteroid. The main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Dawn will study Vesta for one year, and observations will help scientists understand the earliest chapter of our solar system's history. As the spacecraft approaches Vesta, surface details are coming into focus, as seen in a recent image taken from a distance of about 26,000 miles. Engineers expect the spacecraft to be captured into orbit at approximately 10 p.m. PDT Friday, July 15. They expect to hear from the spacecraft and confirm that it performed as planned during a scheduled communications pass that starts at approximately 11:30 p.m. PDT on Saturday, July 16. When Vesta captures Dawn into its orbit, engineers estimate there will be approximately 9,900 miles between them. At that point, the spacecraft and asteroid will be approximately 117 million miles from Earth. \"It has taken nearly four years to get to this point,\" said Robert Mase, Dawn project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Our latest tests and check-outs show that Dawn is right on target and performing normally.\" Engineers have been subtly shaping Dawn's trajectory for years to match Vesta's orbit around the sun. Unlike other missions, where dramatic propulsive burns put spacecraft into orbit around a planet, Dawn will ease up next to Vesta. Then the asteroid's gravity will capture the spacecraft into orbit. However, until Dawn nears Vesta and makes accurate measurements, the asteroid's mass and gravity will only be estimates. So the Dawn team will need a few days to refine the exact moment of orbit capture. Launched in September 2007, Dawn will depart for its second destination, the dwarf planet Ceres, in July 2012.

After studying Vesta in unprecedented detail, the Dawn probe is expected fire up its ion propulsion system to leave orbit and head to Ceres - an object so big it is the largest asteroid in the solar system and officially designated a dwarf planet. Ceres is about 590 miles wide. Dawn will arrive at this target in 2015, NASA officials said. Dawn launched in September 2007 and has covered more than 1.7 billion miles on the voyage to Vesta. Just after Dawn arrived at Vesta, the spacecraft beamed a message to Earth to alert its NASA controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., of the milestone. But the exact time of the probe's asteroid arrival is not yet known, NASA officials said.

If the asteroid is less massive, the gravitational pull would be weaker and Dawn would have taken longer to reach orbit. Missions to asteroid. But arrival time aside, the Dawn probe is most assuredly blazing a new trail in space, NASA officials said. While past missions by NASA and other space agencies have sent spacecraft to visit asteroids, none of those targets were in the asteroid belt. In 2000, NASA's Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous Shoemaker probe went into orbit around the asteroid Eros, ultimately landing on the space rock at the end of its mission. Japan's Hayabusa mission sent a probe to collect samples from the asteroid Itokawa. That mission returned tiny grains of Itokawa to Earth last year. Dawn's mission was first-approved by NASA in 2001, a year after the NEAR Shoemaker arrival at Eros. But budget issues prompted NASA to cancel the mission in March 2006, which sparked outcry among researchers. NASA reinstated the mission just weeks after its cancellation. NASA is now planning to launch a new asteroid mission called Osiris- Rex, in spacecraft to a near- Earth asteroid in 2016 and collect samples from the space rock in 2020. That mission is expected to return any samples it collects to Earth in 2023.

So far, Dawn has beamed back surprising views of Vesta that revealed an enormous mountain in the asteroid's southern hemisphere and show that its crater surface is incredibly diverse place. \"We are learning many amazing things about Vesta, which we call the smallest terrestrial planet,\" Chris Russell, principal investigator of the Dawn mission, said in a statement. \"Like Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury, Vesta has ancient basaltic lava flows on the surface and a large iron core ... The south polar mountain is larger than the big island of Hawaii, the largest mountain on Earth, as measured from the ocean floor. It is almost as high as the highest mountain in the solar system, the shield volcano Olympus Mons on Mars.\" Vesta's giant southern mountain is nearly as tall as Olympus Mons, the largest mountain in the solar system, which soars about 15 miles above the surface. On Earth, the largest terrestrial volcano is Mauna Loa in Hawaii, which rises up 6 miles high, including the portion of the volcano that extends underwater to the sea floor. Mount Everest, the tallest mountain above sea level on Earth, is a paltry 5.5 miles tall. Dawn also revealed that Vesta's surface appears to be much rougher than most asteroids in the main asteroid belt, which is a vast region full of space rocks between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Additionally, preliminary estimates of crater age dates on Vesta suggest that regions in the southern hemisphere are far younger than in the north - with some areas in the southern hemisphere only about 1 to 2 billion years old. The findings were presented today at the 2011 European Planetary Science Congress and the Division for Planetary Sciences Joint Meeting in Nantes, France. The $466 million Dawn spacecraft entered orbit around Vesta on July 15, beginning a yearlong mission to orbit and study the asteroid. After a year of studying Vesta, the Dawn probe is expected to head off to explore Ceres, the largest asteroid in the solar system. Vesta, which measures about 330 miles across, is the second- largest object in the main asteroid belt and is the brightest asteroid in our solar system. The surface of Vesta provides scientists with clues into the space rock's past. Since July, Dawn has been moving steadily closer to Vesta, transitioning into a polar orbit as it scans the asteroid's surface. In mid- August, the probe mapped the entire sunlit surface of Vesta in visible and infrared wavelengths. The spacecraft has since moved into a lower orbit and will spend the coming month mapping the asteroid's sunlit surface at a different resolution, said Carol Raymond, Dawn's deputy principal investigator. Scientists are now closely studying Vesta's craters, ridges and hills, and hope to have the sunlit surface of the asteroid completely mapped by the end of the year, Russell added. NASA's Dawn spacecraft obtained this image with its framing camera on July 18, 2011. It was taken from a distance of about 6,500 miles away from the protoplanet Vesta. Dawn's framing camera is equipped with seven color filters that collect spectral information that enable scientists to show surface features in false color maps that would not normally be visible to the naked eye. These false colors are ratios of light intensity at different wavelengths, and are indications of different surface materials. The spacecraft's observations showed particularly strong differences in surface composition around craters. \"Data from different wavelengths can be combined to investigate different types of materials,\" said Maria Cristina de Sanctis, of Italy's National Institute for Astrophysics, which manages Dawn's Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer. \"The color variations seen by VIR suggest variability in the surface mineralogy.\" NASA's Dawn spacecraft took this image of the south polar region of Vesta, which has a diameter of 330 miles. The image was taken on July 9, 2011, and it has a scale of about 2.2 miles per pixel. To enhance details, the resolution was enlarged to .6 miles per pixel. This region is characterized by rough topography, a large mountain, impact craters, grooves and steep scarps. Researchers also said that the difference in the number of craters in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere is also striking. The relative ages of the craters and regions can be roughly calculated by counting the number of craters per unit area in the different terrains. Early estimates show that areas in the south may be much younger than in the north. The oldest ages that have been found in the south so far are younger than 4 billion years old, which was surprising to the researchers since meteorites from Vesta were calculated to be about 4 billion years old. But, the ages of Vesta's craters should become more precise as Dawn continues its yearlong mapping mission, the scientists said. \"The variation in Vesta's brightness as the sun angle changes indicates that the surface of Vesta is very rough, causing light to scatter,\" Raymond said in a statement. \"This roughness could be at the scales of surface features or at the scale of individual minerals in the rocks, or both. Vesta's roughness is larger than most asteroids in the main asteroid belt.\" NASA's Dawn probe has only just begin its mission to map Vesta, and should continue to study the asteroid through mid-2012 before continuing on to its next target: Ceres.

The asteroid appears as a small, bright pearl against a background of stars. Vesta is also known as a protoplanet, because it is a large body that almost formed into a planet. \"After plying the seas of space for more than a billion miles, the Dawn team finally spotted its target,\" said Carol Raymond, Dawn's deputy principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"This first image hints of detailed portraits to come from Dawn's upcoming visit.\" Vesta is 530 kilometers in diameter and the second most massive object in the asteroid belt. Ground- and space-based telescopes obtained images of the bright orb for about two centuries, but with little surface detail.

To enter orbit, Dawn must match the asteroid's path around the sun, which requires very precise knowledge of the body's location and speed. By analyzing where Vesta appears relative to stars in framing camera images, navigators will pin down its location and enable engineers to refine the spacecraft's trajectory. Dawn will start collecting science data in early August at an altitude of approximately 1,700 miles above the asteroid's surface. As the spacecraft gets closer, it will snap multi-angle images, allowing scientists to produce topographic maps. Dawn will later orbit at approximately 200 kilometers to perform other measurements and obtain closer shots of parts of the surface. Dawn will remain in orbit around Vesta for one year.

Jaumann made the film by stitching together high-resolution images that were taken by Dawn from July- to-August 2011. \"If you want to know what it's like to explore a new world like Vesta, this new video gives everyone a chance to see it for themselves,\" Jaumann said in a statement. \"Scientists are poring over these images to learn more about how the craters, hills, grooves and troughs we see were created.\" At the beginning of the video, Vesta appears at the center of the frame, looming larger and larger as the spacecraft approaches. From this global viewpoint, Vesta's mysterious band of ridges and troughs at its equator can be seen. Viewers then fly over the asteroid with scenic close-ups of Vesta's battered surface, including three huge craters that are peculiarly linked at their rims. Mission scientists nicknamed these craters in Vesta's northern hemisphere the \"Snowman\" craters because of their distinct likeness to the wintery figure. This bird's-eye view of Vesta also includes a virtual tour of a massive mountain inside an expansive crater at the rock's south pole. The central peak stands a staggering 16 miles high, which is more than twice the height of Mount Everest. Since arriving at Vesta, Dawn has been beaming back the clearest views yet of the huge, battered space rock. The images featured in the film were obtained as the spacecraft approached the asteroid, and as the probe made its first orbit collecting science data. This orbit, which is known as the survey orbit, took the probe to an altitude of about 1,700 miles above Vesta's surface. \"Dawn's data thus far have revealed the rugged topography and complex textures of the surface of Vesta, as can be seen in this video,\" Carol Raymond, Dawn deputy principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement. \"Soon, we'll add other pieces of the puzzle such as the chemical composition, interior structure, and geologic age to be able to write the history of this remnant protoplanet and its place in the early solar system.\" A set of three craters, nicknamed \"Snowman,\" are seen in this image of the asteroid Vesta's northern hemisphere. This image was obtained by the framing camera on NASA's Dawn spacecraft on July 24, 2011, from a distance of about 3,200 miles. Measuring 330 miles across, Vesta is the second-most-massive object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Because of its size, many astronomers classify Vesta as a protoplanet, saying it would have continued to develop into a rocky planet like Earth or Mars if Jupiter's gravity had not wreaked havoc in the asteroid belt long ago. NASA's Dawn mission is the first prolonged visit to a large asteroid. The spacecraft was launched in September 2007 and has since traveled more than 1.7 billion miles. Dawn arrived at Vesta July 15 and will spend a year studying the giant rock and taking detailed photos of it from three different orbits. Then, the spacecraft will leave Vesta's orbit and travel to the asteroid Ceres, which is the largest body in the main asteroid belt. Ceres measures about 590 miles across and is so large that it is considered to be a dwarf planet. Dawn is expected to arrive at Ceres in February 2015.

Dawn recently entered its lowest orbit yet around the rock, which lies in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The cozy orbit is allowing the spacecraft to observe new details about a body that scientists think could have been a planet, had things developed differently. Small grooves, lines and dimples along Vesta's surface are revealed in the new photos, potentially giving astronomers clues about the space rock's history, as well as the history of the solar system as a whole. The asteroid is covered in craters from impacts of smaller asteroids in the crowded debris field where it orbits. This close-up photo of the asteroid Vesta taken by NASA's Dawn spacecraft shows a part of one of the troughs at the equator of the asteroid. In the image, the floor of one of the equatorial troughs appears as the brighter deposit at the bottom of this image, contrasted against the darker band of the trough edge. Dawn beamed the new images to Earth on Dec. 13, and NASA released them Wednesday. Dawn entered its closest orbit on Dec. 12, spiraling down to an altitude 130 miles above the asteroid's surface. Scientists plan to keep the probe there for about 10 weeks, before sending Dawn back up higher to observe with a wider field of view again. While in this lowest orbit, researchers hope Dawn collects data to shed light on the composition of Vesta's surface and its interior structure. The spacecraft will take optical photos, as well as measurements of gamma-rays and neutrons from the surface. Vesta is the second most-massive body in the asteroid belt, with a width of about 330 miles. It's what's known as a protoplanet, because if Jupiter's gravity hadn't swept away nearby material as the solar system was forming, scientists think Vesta could have developed into a full-fledged planet. The $466 million Dawn probe launched in 2007 on a mission to study Vesta and another intriguing space rock, the dwarf planet Ceres. In July 2012, Dawn will depart Vesta and head for its new target, where it's expected to arrive by February 2015.

Though generally thought to be quite dry, roughly half of the giant asteroid Vesta is expected to be so cold and to receive so little sunlight that water ice could have survived there for billions of years, according to the first published models of Vesta's average global temperatures and illumination by the sun. \"Near the north and south poles, the conditions appear to be favorable for water ice to exist beneath the surface,\" says Timothy Stubbs of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Stubbs and Yongli Wang of the Goddard Planetary Heliophysics Institute at the University of Maryland published the models in the January 2012 issue of the journal Icarus. The models are based on information from telescopes including NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Vesta, the second-most massive object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, probably does not have any significant permanently shadowed craters where water ice could stay frozen on the surface all the time, not even in the roughly 300-mile-diameter crater near the south pole, the authors note. The asteroid isn't a good candidate for permanent shadowing because it is tilted on its axis at about 27 degrees, which is even greater than Earth's tilt of roughly 23 degrees. In contrast, the moon, which does have permanently shadowed craters, is tilted at only about 1.5 degrees. As a result of its large tilt, Vesta has seasons, and every part of the surface is expected to see the sun at some point during Vesta's year. The presence or absence of water ice on Vesta tells scientists something about the tiny world's formation and evolution, its history of bombardment by comets and other objects, and its interaction with the space environment. Because similar processes are common to many other planetary bodies, including the moon, Mercury and other asteroids, learning more about these processes has fundamental implications for our understanding of the solar system as a whole. This kind of water ice is also potentially valuable as a resource for further exploration of the solar system. Though temperatures on Vesta fluctuate during the year, the model predicts that the average annual temperature near Vesta's north and south poles is less than roughly minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit. That is the critical average temperature below which water ice is thought to be able to survive in the top 10 feet or so of the soil, which is called regolith. Near Vesta's equator, however, the average yearly temperature is roughly minus 190 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the new results. Based on previous modeling, that is expected to be high enough to prevent water from remaining within a few meters of the surface. This band of relatively warm temperatures extends from the equator to about 27 degrees north and south in latitude. \"On average, it's colder at Vesta's poles than near its equator, so in that sense, they are good places to sustain water ice,\" says Stubbs. \"But they also see sunlight for long periods of time during the summer seasons, which isn't so good for sustaining ice. So if water ice exists in those regions, it may be buried beneath a relatively deep layer of dry regolith.\" The modeling also indicates that relatively small surface features, such as craters measuring around 6 miles in diameter, could significantly affect the survival of water ice. \"The bottoms of some craters could be cold enough on average -- about 100 kelvins -- for water to be able to survive on the surface for much of the Vestan year about 3.6 years on Earth ,\" Stubbs explains. \"Although, at some point during the summer, enough sunlight would shine in to make the water leave the surface and either be lost or perhaps redeposit somewhere else.\" So far, Earth-based observations suggest that the surface of Vesta is quite dry. However, the Dawn spacecraft is getting a much closer view. Dawn is investigating the role of water in the evolution of planets by studying Vesta and Ceres, two bodies in the asteroid belt that are considered remnant protoplanets - baby planets whose growth was interrupted when Jupiter formed. Dawn is looking for water using the gamma ray and neutron detector spectrometer, which can identify hydrogen-rich deposits that could be associated with water ice. The spacecraft recently entered a low orbit that is well suited to collecting gamma ray and neutron data. \"Our perceptions of Vesta have been transformed in a few months as the Dawn spacecraft has entered orbit and spiraled closer to its surface,\" says Lucy McFadden, a planetary scientist at NASA Goddard and a Dawn mission co- investigator. \"More importantly, our new views of Vesta tell us about the early processes of solar system formation. If we can detect evidence for water beneath the surface, the next question will be is it very old or very young, and that would be exciting to ponder.\" The modeling done by Stubbs and Wang, for example, relies on information about Vesta's shape. Before Dawn, the best source of that information was a set of images taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in 1994 and 1996. But now, Dawn and its camera are getting a much closer view of Vesta. \"The Dawn mission gives researchers a rare opportunity to observe Vesta for an extended period of time, the equivalent of about one season on Vesta,\" says Stubbs. \"Hopefully, we'll know in the next few months whether the GRaND spectrometer sees evidence for water ice in Vesta's regolith. This is an important and exciting time in planetary exploration.\" Dawn's mission to Vesta and Ceres is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

The spacecraft is healthy and continuing its intensive campaign to reveal the astonishing nature of this body in the mysterious depths of the main asteroid belt. Since the last log, the robotic explorer has devoted most of its time to its two primary scientific objectives in this phase of the mission. With its gamma ray and neutron detector, it has been patiently measuring Vesta's very faint nuclear emanations. These signals reveal the atomic constituents of the material near the surface. Dawn also broadcasts a radio beacon with which navigators on distant Earth can track its orbital motion with exquisite accuracy. That allows them to measure Vesta's gravity field and thereby infer the interior structure of this complex world. In addition to these top priorities, the spacecraft is using its camera and its visible and infrared mapping spectrometer to obtain more detailed views than they could in the higher orbits. As we have delved into these activities in detail in past logs, let's consider here some more aspects of controlling this extremely remote probe as it peers down at the exotic colossus 210 kilometers beneath it. Well, the first aspect that is worth noting is that it is incredibly cool! Continuing to bring this fascinating extraterrestrial orb into sharper focus is thrilling, and everyone who is moved by humankind's bold efforts to reach into the cosmos shares in the experience. As a reminder, you can see the extraordinary sights Dawn has by going here for a new image every weekday, each revealing another intriguing aspect of the diverse landscape. The data sent back are providing exciting and important new insights into Vesta, and those findings will continue to be announced in press releases. Therefore, we will turn our attention to a second aspect of operating in LAMO. Last month, we saw that various forces contribute to Dawn moving slightly off its planned orbital path. Now let's investigate some of the consequences. This will involve a few more technical points than most logs, but each will be explained, and together they will help illustrate one of the multitudinous complexities that must be overcome to make such a grand adventure successful. Far away, traveling through the vast expanse of empty space, Dawn only knows where it is because of information the mission control team installs in it. This is typical for interplanetary spacecraft. Earth-orbiting satellites may be able to use the Global Positioning System constellation or other means to find their own location, but only a few spacecraft that have gone far from Earth have the means to independently establish their own location. This should not be confused with a spacecraft's ability to determine its own orientation, which Dawn does with its star trackers, gyros, and sun sensors. In the same way, if you were in a dark and unidentified place on your planet, you could determine the direction you were looking by recognizing patterns of stars, but that would not help you ascertain your position. Throughout the mission, controllers regularly transmit to the spacecraft a mathematical description of its location in the solar system at any instant over a given period of time. They also provide it with the information needed to calculate where Earth is. That's how it is able to point its main antenna in the correct direction when it needs to do so. During the Vesta phase of the mission, the probe is given the additional means it needs to determine its location relative to Vesta. All the information sent to the spacecraft is based on navigators' best prediction of where the spacecraft will be in the future. Dawn remains unaware of any deviations from its expected course, so it always behaves as if it were exactly where it would be if its motion matched the team's projections perfectly, without the discrepancies that are sure to occur. For the majority of the mission, both in interplanetary cruise and at higher altitude orbits at Vesta, the effects of being slightly off the predicted trajectory are insignificant. In LAMO, they are not. For Dawn to aim its scientific sensors at Vesta, controllers instruct it to point straight \"down.\" Again, it knows how to compute where \"down\" is because of the information it was given by navigators. Any disparity between where the craft was predicted to be and where it really is along its orbit causes it to point in a slightly different direction, not quite truly straight down. This does not compromise the observations; it could tolerate larger pointing errors and still capture the desired targets in the field of view of the instruments. Dawn is a very large spacecraft. Indeed, the wingspan from one solar array tip to the other is 19.7 meters. When it was launched in 2007, this was the greatest span of any probe NASA had ever dispatched on an interplanetary journey. The large area of solar cells is needed to capture faint sunlight in the asteroid belt to meet all of the electrical power needs. Each solar array wing is the width of a singles tennis court, and the whole spacecraft would reach from a pitcher's mound to home plate on a professional baseball field, although Dawn is engaged in activities considerably more inspiring and rewarding than competitive sports. Now consider that when Dawn is looking precisely down, directly toward the center of Vesta, its wings are level. If it is pointed off even a little, then one of those long extensions is slightly closer to the massive body it is circling and one is slightly farther away. Because gravity diminishes with increasing distance, the one that is closer is subject to a very slightly stronger pull than the farther other. If unchecked, that lower side would gently be pulled down even more, thus increasing the difference in gravitational attraction between the two wings still more. Eventually, this would cause Dawn to be oriented so that one wing points straight down toward the ancient surface below and the other points straight up, back into the depths of space. Because this phenomenon depends on the change in gravity from the lower point to the higher one, it is known as \"gravity gradient.\" Some satellites that orbit Earth are designed to take advantage of the gravity gradient to align their long axis with the planet below, but Dawn need greater flexibility in where they point. Rather than accepting the passive method of orienting provided by the gravity gradient, Dawn uses its reaction wheels to train its science instruments on Vesta. By electrically changing the rate at which these devices spin, the ship can control its orientation in the zero-gravity, frictionless conditions of spaceflight. When a small deviation from the perfect orbit causes it to tip its wings a little when pointing to where it calculates \"down\" to be, the spacecraft's reaction wheels work to prevent it from succumbing to the gravity gradient, countering the tendency of the wings to deviate still more from being level. As a consequence, the ship remains stable and the wheels gradually spin faster and faster as it conducts its observations. To reduce the wheels' speeds, mission planners schedule a period almost every day in LAMO during which the spacecraft fires its reaction control system thrusters, a function known as \" desaturating the wheels .\" Indeed, the principal reason Dawn is outfitted with these small thrusters and a modest supply of conventional rocket propellant known as hydrazine is to manage the speed of the wheels. The thruster firings not only provide the torque needed to reduce the rotation rate of the wheels, but they also have the incidental effect of propelling the spacecraft slightly. The push is small, changing the orbital speed by no more than about one centimeter per second. But that causes Dawn to deviate from its planned orbit, and the accumulated force from all the firings is the largest source of trajectory discrepancies in LAMO. To summarize so far, once Dawn has any variance at all between the predicted orbital motion that mission controllers have radioed to it and its actual path, its long wings will be tipped a little while it observes Vesta. In opposing the resultant gravity gradient effect, the reaction wheels will accelerate. When the reaction control system thrusters fire to decelerate the wheels, they will nudge Dawn still more off course, and the cycle will continue. Of course, engineers have devised strategies to accommodate this contribution to deviations from the plan. In LAMO, they frequently measure the ship's trajectory and revise their estimates of the future course. They transmit to the spacecraft a new prediction for the orbit twice a week, so the main computer usually has a very good estimate of where it is relative to Vesta and hence how to orient itself so that its long solar arrays remain level as it acquires its fabulous pictures and other scientific information. With the updated knowledge of its position, Dawn can aim its sensors accurately and keep the thruster firings from being excessive, even when it is not following its orbit perfectly. This solution works well, but let's continue delving into the consequences of the orbital perturbations. While the operations team has the capability to provide the ship regularly with a good description of where it will be, it is much more difficult to make such frequent adjustments to its detailed itinerary. The schedule of its myriad activities has to be planned longer in advance. The sequences of commands, which are timed to the second, are very complicated to develop and verify, and the operations team does not have the resources to refine the timing as often as they can send updates on the craft's predicted location. Engineers took many factors into account in selecting the orbits Dawn uses for its science observations. We saw in November that the orbits are characterized not only by the altitude but also by the orientation of the orbital plane. A subsequent log will explain the choices for the planes more fully, but for now, what matters is that, among other considerations, the orbits were designed to ensure Dawn remains in constant sunlight. It always has the sun in sight, never entering Vesta's shadow. Keeping Earth in view at all times was not part of the design, and on every one of the more than 600 revolutions around the gigantic rocky body since August 28 ), the spacecraft has been temporarily behind Vesta from the geocentric point of view. In its present orbit, these occultations last for about half an hour in every 4.3-hour loop. When Dawn is observing Vesta, that doesn't matter. When it is using its ion propulsion system to transfer from one orbit to another, it also doesn't matter. It does matter, however, when it is in contact with Earth, because Vesta blocks the radio signal. Controllers give the spacecraft a detailed schedule of which data to transmit and when, making the best possible use of the precious communications link that stretches across the solar system. The timed plan tells it not to send high priority data during the radio blackout, but the timing of the occultations can shift a little as the orbit departs from the plan. The strategy to deal with the slight deviations in the timing of the interruption in the radio link principally involves including some padding in the plan. The schedule for the transmission of the highest priority data places it well away from the expected gap, so no important losses occur if Dawn is a little ahead in its orbit or a little behind. But what is there to do during and near the time the craft is predicted to be blocked by Vesta while conducting a communications session? Dawn rotates too slowly to make it worth turning to point its sensors at the surface just for these periods. Of course, it could simply transmit nothing at all. Instead, the team has it transmit data that otherwise would be lost. There is never enough time to send to Earth all the information the probe generates and collects. So most of the time it is behind Vesta, it broadcasts many of the measurements of its own subsystems that cannot be stored and sent later. And during the periods immediately before and after the expected occultation, when there is a chance that the signal will reach Earth, it sends bonus pictures and VIR spectra. If the deviations from the planned orbit are small, then the antenna will have an unobstructed view of Earth, and these data will make it home. And if the spacecraft enters the blackout period late, then it will exit late as well, so the bonus results sent before the occultation will be received. But in the rest of the cases, well, Dawn will transmit those bits right back where they came from, sending the photos and spectra into the vast rocky surface between the spacecraft and Earth. Last month we described one of the limitations in how much bonus information could be obtained from LAMO. Now we have another. In summary, because the probe can acquire more images and other data than it is possible to return, it radios some of them during times that it is possible they will make it to Earth. Because of realistic causes of variation from its predicted orbital path, however, some of these measurements will be transmitted when, from Dawn's perspective, Vesta blocks Earth, thus preventing the broadcast signals from getting through. The GRaND observations are scheduled to be sent during times that, even with the reasonable range of orbit discrepancies, the communications link will not be obstructed. In this way, mission planners return as much data as possible, taking maximum advantage of the time Dawn points its main antenna to Earth. Having a sophisticated robot in orbit around the second most massive resident of the asteroid belt presents truly unique opportunities for the exploration of the solar system, and the team has devised every strategy they could to use the time as productively as possible. The spacecraft aims GRaND at Vesta most of the time in order to develop a good picture of the weak nuclear glow. Controllers schedule three periods per week, each about eight hours, in which it directs its antenna to Earth. The orbit predictions have been extremely good, matching the actual motion quite well. Moreover, some time is allocated to return the camera and VIR data apart from the times that Vesta might be in the way. As a result, the team has been rewarded with more than 3200 photos from LAMO so far. Every one is bonus, and every one is neat! After well over four years of travel in deep space and already half a year in orbit around Vesta, engineers recently encountered a bug lurking in the spacecraft's software. As with most bugs, this one had waited silently until just the right circumstances occurred to provoke it. The combination of conditions was achieved late in the day on January 13, and the bug caused the main computer to reboot. Dawn correctly responded by going into safe mode. The mission control team observed this the next day, and promptly began investigating the reason. They soon determined the nature of the bug and restored the spacecraft to its usual operating configuration for LAMO. Even with the slow communications in safe mode, the long time for radio signals to travel between Earth and Dawn, and the frequent interruptions by the regular occultations by Vesta, they had fully restored all systems by January 19. It took a few more days to configure GRaND, but it, along with the other instruments, is now back to its intensive inspection of Vesta. We saw last month that the mission has been progressing so well that the time originally allocated to deal with anomalies had not been needed, so it is being applied to extend the duration of LAMO. This allows even more scientific observations to be conducted in this lowest altitude. Far from the planet it left in 2007, in a region of the solar system in which no other spacecraft has ever taken up residence, Dawn will continue its exploration of Vesta, alternating between examining the alien world below and transmitting its discoveries to Earth. Meanwhile, everyone who ponders what undiscovered lands lie beyond our sight, everyone who hungers for exciting challenges and noble adventures, and everyone who values turning the unknown into the known profits from the great treasures this stalwart cosmic ambassador sends to its erstwhile home, a faraway place it will never visit again. Dawn is 210 kilometers from Vesta. It is also 3.08 AU from Earth, or 1155 times as far as the moon and 3.13 times as far as the sun today. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take 51 minutes to make the round trip.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2012/1/a-look-inside-dawns-grand-asteroid-adventure"}, {"title": "NASA's Dawn spacecraft sees New Surface Features on Giant Asteroid Vesta", "date": "2012-03-22", "content": "NASA's Dawn spacecraft has revealed unexpected details on the surface of the giant asteroid Vesta. New images and data highlight the diversity of Vesta's surface and reveal unusual geologic features, some of which were never previously seen on asteroids. These results were discussed Wednesday at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference at The Woodlands, Texas. \"Our analysis finds this bright material originates from Vesta and has undergone little change since the formation of Vesta over 4 billion years ago,\" said Jian-Yang Li, a Dawn participating scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park. \"We're eager to learn more about what minerals make up this material and how the present Vesta surface came to be.\" Bright areas appear everywhere on Vesta but are most predominant in and around craters. The areas vary from several hundred feet to around 10 miles across. Rocks crashing into the surface of Vesta seem to have exposed and spread this bright material. This impact process may have mixed the bright material with darker surface material. While scientists had seen some brightness variations in previous images of Vesta from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, Dawn scientists also did not expect such a wide variety of distinct dark deposits across its surface. The dark materials on Vesta can appear dark gray, brown and red. They sometimes appear as small, well-defined deposits around impact craters. They also can appear as larger regional deposits, like those surrounding the impact craters scientists have nicknamed the \"snowman.\" \"One of the surprises was the dark material is not randomly distributed,\" said David Williams, a Dawn participating scientist at Arizona State University, Tempe. \"This suggests underlying geology determines where it occurs.\" The dark materials seem to be related to impacts and their aftermath. Scientists theorize carbon-rich asteroids could have hit Vesta at speeds low enough to produce some of the smaller deposits without blasting away the surface. Higher-speed asteroids also could have hit Vesta's surface and melted the volcanic basaltic crust, darkening existing surface material. That melted conglomeration appears in the walls and floors of impact craters, on hills and ridges, and underneath brighter, more recent material called ejecta, which is material thrown out from a space rock impact. Vesta's dark materials suggest the giant asteroid may preserve ancient materials from the asteroid belt and beyond, possibly from the birth of the solar system. \"Some of these past collisions were so intense they melted the surface,\" said Brett Denevi, a Dawn participating scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, MD. \"Dawn's ability to image the melt marks a unique find. Melting events like these were suspected, but never before seen on an asteroid.\" Dawn launched in September 2007. It will reach its second destination, Ceres, in February 2015. \"Dawn's ambitious exploration of Vesta has been going beautifully,\" said Marc Rayman, Dawn chief engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA. \"As we continue to gather a bounty of data, it is thrilling to reveal fascinating alien landscapes.\" Dawn's mission is managed by JPL for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

Each destination is different, after all Mars isn't Jupiter which isn't Enceladus which isn't the sun. But as for the spaceships themselves? No so much that's unfamiliar: a collection of engines and thrusters and instruments and a lot of explosive fuel. That, at least, has been the rule. But that rule has changed thanks to the Dawn spacecraft. You may never have heard of Dawn, and if you haven't, you're not alone. In a solar system full of dazzling bodies, its destination is nothing more glamorous than an asteroid two of them, actually. And as a descendant of a long line of spacecraft designed to fly very, very fast, Dawn flies very, very slowly or at least it accelerates that way. But that very pokiness is part of its genius, and the dazzling new stream of pictures and other data now pouring back from the first half of Dawn's journey is proving that the NASA engineers knew just what they were doing. Dawn was launched in 2007, on a slow journey to the asteroid Vesta and later, to its bigger sister Ceres. Vesta is the second largest body in the asteroid belt about 360 mi. across, or roughly the size of Arizona. When the Delta rocket that blasted Dawn into space and then out of Earth orbit was spent and discarded, the craft was moving at an impressive 25,000 mph clip fast, certainly, but more speed still would be needed to get the ship out to the asteroid belt, into orbit around Vesta, then out of orbit and onto Ceres. All that flying and maneuvering takes a lot of fuel, which can add weight and drive up mission costs. The answer: replace chemical fuel with light xenon gas about 270 liters of it, which is small by spacecraft standards and then use that fuel very sparingly. The key to that was ion propulsion technology, which is just as cool as it sounds. Two large solar panels, measuring 65 ft. from one tip to the other, gather power from the sun and then ionize the xenon, accelerating it through the engine's exhaust and providing thrust. Any old noble gas would do for this job helium, neon, argon, krypton but the xenon ion is the most massive of the group, as atoms go, and thus creates more thrust. Of course, just as \"massive\" is a relative term, so is \"more thrust.\" The stream of xenon ions coming from the engine bell produces a thrust of just 91 millinewtons, or about the force a piece of paper exerts on your hand when you pick it up. That's a little bit shy of, say, the 7.5 million lbs. of thrust the Saturn V produced when it blasted off the pad. But physics plays a long game. Not only is ion propulsion economical, burning less than 3 milligram of fuel per second, the featherweight thrust it produces is cumulative. The engine burns more or less constantly on its outward trip stopping only for eight hrs. once a week so that the ship's main antenna can be aligned toward Earth for a status report. Still, even such constant thrusting adds only 15 mph per day, or zero to 60 in four days, not exactly flooring it. Over the course of 67 days, however, that adds up to an additional 1,000 mph. That's a lot in a journey through the solar system, since spacecraft don't typically make a straightahead, as-the- crow-flies trip to a destination, but rather go into orbit around the sun and then gently add velocity so they spiral out to where they're going. \"Over the course of years we sculpted the orbit,\" says Marc Rayman Dawn's chief engineer and mission director. \"By the time we got to Vesta we were essentially in the same orbit as the asteroid, approaching it at a relative speed of 60 mph.\" That was back in August, when Rayman's team tweaked the ion thrusters so that the spacecraft could descend into orbit around the asteroid. Dawn is now barnstorming Vesta, flying at a very low altitude of 130 mi. and the images it's returned have been suitably extraordinary revealing bright surface material splattered around craters from long ago meteor strikes, and less-disturbed stretches of more pristine landscape. This provides clues to the asteroid's interior and about the primal forces that shaped it 4.5 billion years ago. \"One of the things that's cool about Dawn is that we're exploring uncharted worlds,\" says Rayman. \"We say that Vesta has a diameter that's roughly equivalent to Arizona's, but remember it's a three dimensional body and we're orbiting it. So overall we're studying an area twice the size of California.\" And compared to the next destination, even that's small. Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, is 590 mi. across and should have an even more variegated surface. Dawn will arrive there in Feb. of 2015 and spend 5 months studying the asteroid up close. By then, the mission is scheduled to be bought to a close, its funding if not the spacecraft's fuel expended. Whatever Dawn discovers about Ceres and Vesta, however, it's already proven the larger point that after half a century of blast-and-go spacecraft, we now have a second decidedly more elegant way to get around.

In a series of papers published in the Journal Science on May 10, 2012, the new findings reveal that Vesta is a protoplanet with complex landscapes and is home to one of the largest mountains in the solar system. The findings also confirm that a massive collision in Vesta's past is the source of a common type of meteorite found on Earth. Images from the spacecraft show that Vesta's southern hemisphere is dominated by a massive impact crater - roughly 90% the diameter of the entire asteroid. At almost 20 km deep and 500 km across, it ranks as one of the largest such craters known in our solar system; the Big Island of Hawai'i would fit comfortably inside. Named Rheasilvia - after the mythical mother of the twin founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus - the bowl-shaped depression is dominated by an enormous central mountain that rivals Mars' Olympus Mons as the largest in the solar system. At 20-25 km in height, it is equivalent to stacking two and a half Mt. Everests on top of each other. Based on crater counts in the basin and the surrounding terrain, researchers estimate that the crater is the result of a collision with another asteroid sometime in the past one billion years - approximately one-fifth the age of our planet. The impact demolished half of an older, slightly smaller crater in the vicinity. The second crater, named Veneneia after one of the founding Vestal Virgins, shows rolling landscapes within a 12 km deep semicircular bowl-shaped region delineated by sharp 10 km high scarps. The walls of this crater are roughly as high as the deepest part of Earth's oceans. Astronomers estimate that the collision which produced the Rheasilvia crater most likely launched about one percent of Vesta's volume into space. Both impacts are now leading candidates for what is known as the Vesta family of asteroids - a collection of some 6000 objects in the asteroid belt, of which Vesta is the largest, that all share similar orbits around the Sun. Furthermore, by using spectroscopic analysis - where reflected light from Vesta is broken up into its component wavelengths - Dawn scientists have been able to map the mineralogy of Vesta's surface and confirm that these collisions are the most probable source of the HED meteorites. Composed of the minerals howardite, eucrite, and diegenite, these make up roughly 5% of the meteorites which have fallen to Earth's surface. Studies of Vesta are important to furthering our understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system. Vesta shows many signs of being a remnant protoplanet - a fossil from the solar system's formative years which has managed to survive mostly intact to this day. On its surface, Vesta carries a record of the cataclysmic development of our solar system. Studies of its mineralogy and its layered composition - which most likely includes an iron-nickel core similar to Earth - can provide hints about the environment in which the planets were born. Discovered by Henrich Olbers in 1807, Vesta is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt, the rocky debris field between Mars and Jupiter. Named after the Roman goddess of home and hearth, Vesta was the fourth asteroid to be discovered. The Dawn spacecraft, operated for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, launched in 2007 and arrived at Vesta on July 16, 2011. It will continue to orbit Vesta until August 26, 2012 at which point it will depart for the largest body in the asteroid belt, the dwarf planet Ceres. Upon arrival at Ceres, Dawn will become the first spacecraft to orbit two separate bodies in the solar system. Bottom line: A series of papers published in the journal Science on May 10, 2012 present results from the Dawn spacecraft that show Vesta, the second largest object in the asteroid belt, to be a diverse world. Two massive impact craters in Vesta's southern hemisphere reveal themselves to be the source of the Vesta asteroid family. Spectroscopic analysis confirms that these impacts are the source of HED meteorites found on Earth.

The mission is being managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Rayman's team will not begin its investigation into the reaction wheel-glitch until Dawn is on its way to Ceres, the larger of the two asteroids. The malfunction will not affect Dawn's ability to reach Ceres, he said, adding that the spacecraft's four reaction wheels would have been shut off for the two-year cruise anyway. When Dawn needs to point itself at Earth to communicate with mission control in Pasadena it can use its thrusters to do so. The bonus images of Vesta's north pole, which Dawn was to capture before it left the asteroid, \"would have been low resolution pictures anyway,\" Rayman said. Besides, he said, \"we have already gotten way, way more than we expected out of Vesta, or really even hoped. Our intent when we got to Vesta was to observe 80 percent of the surface. We've already observed much more than that.\" Reaction wheels are used to make the minute positioning adjustments required to keep precision observing instruments on target. This is the second time Dawn has had a reaction-wheel problem. The first problem occurred in 2010. In both instances, the spacecraft's onboard computer shut down the reaction wheel after detecting excessive friction, according to NASA statements. A spokesman for Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles, Va., which built Dawn, said software uploaded to the spacecraft in 2011 to fix the first reaction-wheel glitch can be used again. The Orbital-developed software \"allows Dawn to work in what's called hybrid mode, which is using just two reaction wheels and some thrusting capabilities,\" company spokesman Barron Beneski told Space News Aug. 15. \"That's ready to go on the satellite, so that should work just fine.\" The $450 million Dawn spacecraft, launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., aboard a Delta 2 rocket, reached Vesta last July. It is slated to arrive at Ceres in 2015. About 40 people, all of them JPL employees, are working on Dawn operations, Rayman said.

Dawn's asteroid-mapping mission aims to shed light on the evolution of our solar system by studying huge space rocks, which scientists think are its leftover building blocks. Vesta, which is the solar system's brightest asteroid, and Ceres are chunks of material that might have clumped with other matter to form full-fledged planets under other circumstances, scientists say. Ceres is the largest asteroid in the solar system and is so large it is considered to be a dwarf planet. The shadowy outlines of the terrain in Vesta's northern region are visible in this image from NASA's Dawn spacecraft. The image comes from the last sequence of images Dawn obtained of the giant asteroid Vesta as it departed the giant asteroid Sept. 5, 2012. The $466 million Dawn probe launched in 2007 and arrived in orbit around Vesta on July. 15, 2011. Today at about 2:26 a.m. EDT, it escaped the bonds of Vesta's gravity to begin the years-long trip to Ceres. Before leaving Vesta behind, Dawn snapped some spectacular farewell photos of the huge space rock that revealed a surface only half-lit by sunlight and covered in craters. NASA also released a greatest hits video of Dawn's discoveries at Vesta from the last year. \"As we respectfully say goodbye to Vesta and reflect on the amazing discoveries over the past year, we eagerly look forward to the next phase of our adventure at Ceres, where even more exciting discoveries await,\" Robert Mase, Dawn project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement. While at Vesta, Dawn compiled the first map of the giant 330-mile-wide asteroid body, revealing a geologic landscape that scientists call \"exotic and diverse.\" Dawn spotted two gigantic craters on the weathered surface of Vesta, and determined that the asteroid has an iron core. It will take Dawn about 2 1/2 years to reach the 590-mile-wide Ceres, where it is expected to arrive in 2015. The spacecraft uses an ion propulsion system that allows it to make major course changes in deep space. Dawn used its xenon ion engine to enter orbit around Vesta last year and make its departure today. It will use the same engine to make its way to Ceres and enter orbit around the dwarf planet in February 2015. When Dawn arrives at Ceres, it will be the first spacecraft ever to orbit two bodies in the asteroid belt that encircles the sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Dawn slipped into orbit last year around Vesta - about the size of the U.S. state of Arizona - and beamed back stunning close-ups of the lumpy surface. Its next destination is the Texas-size Ceres, also known as a dwarf planet, meaning it's large enough that its gravitational forces overcome mechanical forces to give it an almost round shape. Vesta and Ceres are the largest bodies in the asteroid belt, which is littered with chunks of rocks that never quite bloomed into full-fledged planets. As cosmic time capsules, they're ideal for scientists trying to piece together how Earth and the other planets formed and evolved. During its year-long stay at Vesta, Dawn used its cameras, infrared spectrometer and gamma ray and neutron detector to explore the asteroid from varying altitudes, getting as close as 209 kilometres above the surface. Dawn uncovered a few surprises. Scientists have long known that Vesta sports an impressive scar at its south pole, likely carved by an impact with a smaller asteroid. A closer inspection revealed that Vesta hid a second scar in the same region - evidence that it had been whacked twice within the last two billion years. The collisions spewed chunks of debris into space; some fell to Earth as meteorites. With its rugged exterior - complete with grooves, troughs and pristine minerals - iron core and 530-kilometre diameter, Vesta acts more like an \"almost planet\" than garden-variety, lightweight asteroids. Vesta was \"on its way to planethood if it continued to grow,\" said chief scientist Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles. Asteroids have received renewed attention of late. U.S. President Barack Obama cancelled a return to the moon in favour of landing astronauts on a yet-to-be- selected asteroid as a stepping stone to Mars. A private company headed by space entrepreneurs wants to mine precious metals from near-Earth asteroids. After racking up 2.7 billion kilometres journeying to Vesta, Dawn has another 1.5 billion kilometres to reach Ceres, where it will arrive in early 2015. Such a trip is possible because of Dawn's futuristic ion propulsion engines, which provide gentle yet constant acceleration. Once confined to science fiction, the technology has been tested in space and is more efficient than conventional rocket fuel that powers most spacecraft. Scientists expect a different world at Ceres. Unlike the rocky, pockmarked Vesta, the nearly spherical Ceres has a dusty surface with an icy interior. Some think it may even have frost-covered poles. \"Almost everything we see at Ceres will be a surprise and totally different from Vesta,\" Russell said.

But NASA's Dawn spacecraft has found evidence that smaller, water-rich asteroids once implanted themselves in Vesta's surface. The water stays locked up in hydrated minerals until subsequent impacts create enough heat to melt the rock and release the water as a gas, leaving pitted vents in the surface. The discovery shows that yet another body in the inner Solar System has a water cycle, says Carle Pieters, a planetary scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and a member of the Dawn science team. \"This is really getting to be interesting,\" says Pieters. The cycle was described in two papers published today in Science. One paper shows how one of Dawn's instruments, which measures \u03b3 rays and neutrons to depths of about a metre, detected an excess of hydrogen in the asteroid's equatorial regions that would indicate a water content as high as 400 parts per million1. The second paper identifies hundreds of pits - some as deep as 200 metres - in several of the same regions that are thought to reflect places where the heat of a subsequent impact unlocked the water content and allowed it to vent into space. William Boynton, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, says that the excess hydrogen could well have come from water in hydrated minerals. He used a similar instrument on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft to identify excess hydrogen that was interpreted as coming from a layer of ice just below the surface in the polar plains of Mars. Hydrated minerals have also been discovered on the Moon by an instrument on the Indian Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft. But Pieters, who is principal investigator of the instrument, says that a very different mechanism was responsible. There, hydrogen atoms from the solar wind implanted themselves in minerals at the surface. Although water-rich asteroids also hit the Moon, she says, any water they contain would be less likely to survive the impact. The Moon has a stronger gravitational field than Vesta, so asteroids hit it much faster. The Dawn spacecraft left Vesta on 5 September and is now heading to Ceres, the biggest asteroid in the Solar System. But Ceres is already known to contain water - some scientists have even proposed that it harbours a subsurface, briny ocean.

Although the asteroids date to the birth of our solar system, our closest looks at them have been glimpses from spacecraft whizzing by en route to the glamorous outer solar system. That changed last July, when NASA's Dawn probe slipped into orbit around Vesta, the asteroid belt's second most massive member. Dawn, managed by Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory with UCLA's Christopher Russell as principal investigator, has now mapped about 80 percent of Vesta in 3D. In May, a set of six papers describing the Dawn team's initial findings were published in the journal Science. The headline news is that Vesta has a substantial nickel-iron core, just like Mercury, Earth, and Mars - a radical notion first proposed in 1970 by Dawn co-investigator Tom McCord. McCord, along with MIT researcher Torrence Johnson and JPL's John Adams, took detailed spectra of Vesta's surface and discovered it was entirely basalt, a type of frozen lava. If Vesta had gotten that hot, the scientists reasoned, its heavy elements would have melted and sunk to the core in a process called differentiation - a key step on the road to planethood. In fact, joked JPL's Carol Raymond, Dawn's deputy principal investigator, \"We like to call Vesta 'the smallest terrestrial planet.'\" Raymond's gravity data put its core at about 18 percent of Vesta's total mass, or proportionally about two-thirds as massive as Earth's core. Dawn's mapping spectrometer has verified an even wilder conjecture from the 1970 paper: Vesta is indeed the source of the howardite-eucrite-diogenite meteorites found on Earth and Mars. Cross sections of a eucrite meteorite found in Antarctica ; a diogenite, also from Antarctica; and a howardite from North Carolina. The eucrite's very fine crystals formed during the rapid cooling of Vesta's upper crust; the diogenite's crystals had time to grow bigger while Vesta's inner crust slowly solidified. Howardite is a mishmash of eucrite and diogenite shards, born in the impact that blew them sky-high. The Dawn team thinks the HEDs came from an impact basin the team has named Rheasilvia, after an ancient Roman vestal virgin priestess. Counting the craters within Rheasilvia gives it an age of about 1 billion years, surprisingly recent for something so big. At 310 miles in diameter, Rheasilvia is nearly as large as Vesta itself, and is the result of a collision that stripped away most of the crust from the southern hemisphere, baring Vesta's interior like a clumsily peeled orange. \"Vesta likely came close to shattering,\" said Raymond, noting that the blow left concentric sets of troughs - fracture lines - around Vesta's equator. Rheasilvia doesn't represent Vesta's only near-death experience. Dawn found a second basin, nearly as big and a billion years older, sticking out from under Rheasilvia. This basin, named Veneneia, is also a potential source of HED meteorites.

It's the first time researchers have found such extensive evidence of this type of asteroid material across a large body's surface. The study seeks to explain a curious pattern of materials that researchers saw in observations from the Dawn spacecraft, which orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012. \"The earliest images we had of the surface - shortly after going into orbit - were sometimes spectacular examples of very bright and very dark material on the surface,\" said researcher Tom McCord of the Bear Fight Institute, a science research facility in Washington state. McCord is the lead author of a study reporting the findings that will be published in the Nov. 1 issue of the journal Nature. Researchers looked at three scenarios - that the dark stuff on Vesta was volcanic basalts, that it came from dark asteroids made up of carbon and primitive organic materials, or that it was \"shock-melted and darkened\" material melted on the surface from the heat of asteroid impacts, McCord said. The light spectrum reflected from the materials gives a strong indication that the dark stuff came from asteroids, McCord said. The scientists found lots of hydrogen and hydroxyl in the materials, which tends to be present in carbonaceous asteroids. \"All of that is consistent, but it doesn't definitively prove carbonaceous chondrite material,\" he said. \"There are pieces of material, and there is no evidence of any other source that we can think of, at least.\" A pioneering find: At 325 miles in diameter, Vesta is big enough to have experienced some of the stages of planetary evolution. For example, when Vesta was formed, it melted and heavier materials sank towards its center, similar to how our dense core formed on Earth. By contrast, most asteroids are loosely held collections of rubble. An asteroid slamming into Earth's moon tends to see most of its materials ripped off as it crashes into the surface. But Vesta's weak gravity compared to the moon, and lower relative velocity with respect to the asteroids hitting it, makes impacts happen more slowly. The dark asteroid materials we see scattered on Vesta's bright basalt surface could have implications for how life got started on the Earth. McCord cited a long-standing theory that the Earth's water and organic material could have come from asteroids or comets elsewhere in the solar system. \"We have, apparently, a dramatic example of the surface of an object being contaminated by material from other objects,\" McCord said of Vesta. \"It forces one to suppose most objects are contaminated this way, and this is the way the Earth got its water and organic material. It not only has implications for the surface of Vesta, but for most other airless inter-solar system objects.\" No space weathering found: In a separate paper published in the same issue of Nature, researchers examined why \"space weathering\" from solar and cosmic radiation, as well as micrometeroid impacts, is not seen on the surface of Vesta. McCord was a co- author of the study, which was led by Brown University's Carle Pieters. Vesta's surface churning appears to be due to asteroids hitting its surface, rather than traditional space weathering. This makes it different from other airless bodies such as the moon, which has a higher gravity that makes asteroids slam into its surface faster, and the asteroid Eros, whose gravity is so weak that it cannot retain impact material as well as Vesta. According to the paper, the new finding means the concept of space weathering extends beyond micrometeroids and solar wind to include the dynamic mixing process of surface particles.", "url": "https://www.space.com/18299-asteroid-vesta-dark-carbon-impacts.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Near-True Color Image of Snowman Space Wallpaper", "date": "2013-01-24", "content": "In this space wallpaper, three impact craters of different sizes, arranged in the shape of a snowman, make up one of the most striking features on Vesta, as seen in this view from NASA's Dawn mission.

As it gradually changes its orbit around the sun, the distance to dwarf planet Ceres slowly shrinks. The pertinacious probe will arrive there in 2015 to explore the largest body between the sun and Neptune that has not yet been glimpsed by a visitor from Earth. Meanwhile, Vesta, the fascinating alien world Dawn revealed in 2011 and 2012, grows ever more distant. The mini- planet it orbited and studied in such detail now appears only as a pinpoint of light 15 times farther from Dawn than the moon is from Earth. Climbing through the solar system atop a column of blue-green xenon ions, Dawn has a great deal of powered flight ahead in order to match orbits with faraway Ceres. Nevertheless, it has shown quite admirably that it is up to the task. The craft has spent more time thrusting and has changed its orbit under its own power more than any other ship from Earth. While most of the next two years will be devoted to still more thrusting, the ambitious adventurer has already accomplished much more than it has left to do. And now it is passing an interesting milestone on its interplanetary trek. With all of the thrusting Dawn has completed, it has now changed its speed by 7.74 kilometers per second, and the value grows as the ion thrusting continues. For space enthusiasts from Earth, that is a special speed, known as \"orbital velocity.\" Many satellites, including the International Space Station, travel at about that velocity in their orbits. So does this mean that Dawn has only now achieved the velocity necessary to orbit Earth? The short answer is no. The longer answer constitutes the remainder of this log. We have discussed some of these principles before, but they are counterintuitive and questions continue to arise. Rather than send our readers on a trajectory through the history of these logs even more complicated than Dawn's flight through the asteroid belt, we will revisit a few of the ideas here. While marking Dawn's progress in terms of its speed is a convenient description of the effectiveness of its maneuvering, it is not truly a measure of how fast it is moving. Rather, it is a measure of how fast it would be moving under very special circumstances. To understand this, we need to look at the nature of orbits in general and Dawn's interplanetary trajectory in particular. The overwhelming majority of craft humans have sent into space have remained in the vicinity of Earth, accompanying that planet on its annual revolutions around the sun. All satellites of Earth remain bound to it by its gravity. As fast as satellites seem to travel compared to terrestrial residents, from the larger solar system perspective, their incessant circling of Earth means their paths through space are not very different from Earth's itself. Consider the path of a car racing around a long track. If a fly buzzes around inside the car, to the driver it may seem to be moving fast, but if someone watching the car from a distance plotted the fly's path, on average it would be pretty much like the car's. Everything on the planet and orbiting it travels around the sun at an average of 30 kilometers per second, completing one full solar orbit every year. To undertake its interplanetary journey and travel elsewhere in the solar system, Dawn needed to break free of Earth's grasp, and that was accomplished by the rocket that carried it to space more than five years ago. Dawn and its erstwhile home went their separate ways, and the sun became the natural reference for the spacecraft's position and speed on its voyage in deep space. Despite the enormous push the Delta II rocket delivered to Dawn, the spacecraft still did not have nearly enough energy to escape from the powerful sun. So, being a responsible resident of the solar system, Dawn has remained faithfully in orbit around the sun, just as Earth and the rest of the planets, asteroids, comets, and other members of the star's entourage have. Whether it is for a spacecraft or moon orbiting a planet, a planet or Dawn orbiting the sun, the sun orbiting the Milky Way galaxy, or the Milky Way galaxy orbiting the Virgo supercluster of galaxies, any orbit is the perfect balance between the inward tug of gravity and the inexorable tendency of objects to travel in a straight path. If you attach a weight to a string and swing it around in a circle, the force you use to pull on the string mimics the gravitational force the sun exerts on the bodies that orbit it. The effort you expend in keeping the weight circling serves constantly to redirect its path; if you let go of the string, the weight's natural motion would carry it away in a straight line. The force of gravity diminishes with distance, so the sun's pull on a nearby body is greater than on a more distant one. Therefore, to remain in orbit, to balance the relentless tug of gravity, the closer object must travel faster, fighting the stronger pull. The same effect applies at Earth. Satellites that orbit very close must streak around the planet at about 7.7 kilometers per second to keep from being pulled down. The moon, orbiting almost 1000 times farther above, needs only to travel at about 1.0 kilometers per second to balance Earth's weaker hold at that distance. Notice that this means that for an astronaut to travel from the surface of Earth to the International Space Station, it would be necessary to accelerate to quite a high speed to rendezvous with the orbital facility. But then once in orbit, to journey to the much more remote moon, the astronaut's speed eventually would have to decline dramatically. Perhaps speed tells an incomplete story in describing the travels of a spacecraft, just as it does with another example of countering gravity. A person throwing a ball is not that different from a rocket launching a satellite. Both represent struggles against Earth's gravitational pull. To throw a ball higher, you have to give it a harder push, imparting more energy to make it climb away from Earth, but as soon as it leaves your hand, it begins slowing. For a harder throw, it will take longer for Earth's gravity to stop the ball and bring it back, so it will travel higher. But from the moment it leaves your hand until it reaches the top of its arc, its speed constantly dwindles as it gradually yields to Earth's tug. The astronaut's trip from the space station to the moon would be accomplished by starting with a high speed \"throw\" from the low starting orbit, and then slowing down until reaching the moon. The rocket that launched Dawn threw it hard enough to escape from Earth, sending it well beyond the International Space Station and even the moon. Dawn's maximum speed relative to Earth on launch day was so high that Earth could not pull it back. As we saw in the explanation of the launch profile, Dawn was propelled to 11.46 kilometers per second, well in excess of the space station's orbital speed given three paragraphs above. But it has remained under the sun's control. Now we can think of the general problem of flying elsewhere in space as similar to climbing a hill. For terrestrial hikers, the rewards of ascent come only after doing the work of pushing against Earth's gravity to reach a higher elevation. Similarly, Dawn is climbing a solar system hill with the sun at the bottom. It started part way up the hill at Earth; and its first rewards were found at a higher elevation, where Vesta, traveling around the sun at only about two thirds of Earth's speed, revealed its fascinating secrets to the visiting ship. The ion thrusting now is propelling it still higher up the hill toward Ceres, which moves even more slowly to balance the still-weaker pull of the sun. If Dawn had been in zero-gravity and not been obligated to obey the laws of orbital motion, the thrusting to date would have accelerated it by the 7.74 kilometers per second mentioned near the beginning. Instead of making the spacecraft go faster, however, that work was designed to climb the solar system hill. If Dawn had been targeted to a destination closer to the sun than Earth, the same amount of thrusting would have helped it speed up to descend the hill, dropping into a lower solar orbit, where it would have to zip around the gravitational master of the solar system faster than Earth. To orbit a body that orbits the sun, a spacecraft has to match its target's solar orbit. Except in science fiction, no spacecraft in history other than Dawn has been designed to orbit two different destinations around the sun. Without its ion propulsion system, this mission would be quite impossible. Tighter orbits require greater velocity in order to counterbalance the stronger pull of gravity. Mercury and Venus orbit the sun faster than Earth. Mars moves around the sun more slowly than Earth, and all residents of the more distant main asteroid belt revolve at an even more leisurely pace. Because spacecraft wind up at different speeds relative to the sun, their final velocity is not as important in their design and operation as is the amount by which they change their velocity after being released from the rocket. Because of these complexities, rocket scientists generally put all spacecraft on a level playing field by using the change of velocity as a measure of the spacecraft's maneuvering capability. Dawn has slowed down tremendously since it departed Earth, but what is noteworthy is the amount by which it has propulsively changed its speed. If it had begun at a starting line with all other spacecraft on that simplified playing field, by now it would be racing along at 7.74 kilometers per second, far faster than any other spacecraft. By the end of its mission, it would be flying at an extraordinary 11 kilometers per second. Most satellites in low Earth orbit hardly change their speed at all, relying instead on the momentum imparted to them by the rockets that took them into space. As you can see by comparing the numbers above, a rocket to Earth orbit delivers about the same speed that Dawn has achieved already, and the rocket that sent the probe on its interplanetary course provides roughly the same speed that Dawn will attain over the coming years. Having changed its speed by the same amount needed to go from the surface of Earth to Earth orbit is only a coincidence. Dawn's rocket gave it an even larger boost. But for maneuvering after launch, this spaceship is in a class by itself. Each spacecraft is designed for a specific mission. As no other spacecraft has attempted a mission like Dawn's, no other spacecraft has needed such an exceptional capability to change its own speed. Together, all the probes humankind has dispatched on interplanetary journeys have helped provide us with new perspectives and new insights on the nature of the solar system, including its origin and evolution. And the people who are interested in them cannot help but be in awe of the daunting challenges, the remarkable engineering, the vast distances, the inspiring adventures, the thrilling sights, and the amazing new knowledge. With its extraordinary ion propulsion system, Dawn is making exciting contributions to this grand endeavor. It has already conducted a richly detailed exploration of one exotic world and, as it thrusts with its ion propulsion system to climb the solar system hill to another, it looks forward to more treasures on its ambitious expedition. Dawn is 5.8 million kilometers from Vesta and 56 million kilometers from Ceres. It is also 2.28 AU from Earth, or 910 times as far as the moon and 2.30 times as far as the sun today.

When it reaches Ceres in 2015, Dawn will become the first spacecraft to go into orbit around two destinations in our solar system beyond Earth. Why two bodies in the asteroid belt? For one thing, Ceres and Vesta are very different objects. Ceres presents an icy - possibly watery - while Vesta is dry. These two bodies are thought to be two of the largest surviving protoplanets - bodies that almost became planets. The study of both Vesta and Ceres is expected to give scientists clues about the planet-forming conditions at the dawn of our solar system. In September 2012, Dawn left Vesta and has been cruising toward Ceres ever since. It's due to arrive approximately one year from now, in late March or early April 2015. Ceres - now labeled as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union - is the largest member of the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Discovered in 1801, Ceres is approximately 590 miles across. Its round shape suggests that its interior is layered like those of terrestrial planets such as Earth. Ceres may have a rocky inner core, an icy mantle, and a thin, dusty outer crust. These characteristics have been inferred from its density and rotation rate of 9 hours. Dawn will be the first spacecraft to see Ceres up close. Bob Mase, Dawn's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, said in a press release earlier this month: Our flight plan around Ceres will be choreographed to be very similarly to the strategy that we successfully used around Vesta. This approach will build on that and enable scientists to make direct comparisons between these two giants of the asteroid belt. UCLA's Christopher Russell, who is Dawn's principal investigator, said of the December 27, 2013 date - on which Dawn becomes closer to Ceres than Vesta - that the transition from leaving Vesta to approaching Ceres ... makes us eager to see what secrets Ceres will reveal to us when we get up close to this ancient, giant, icy body. While Ceres is a lot bigger than the candidate asteroids that NASA is working on sending humans to, many of these smaller bodies are produced by collisions with larger asteroids such as Ceres and Vesta. It is of much interest to determine the nature of small asteroids produced in collisions with Ceres. These might be quite different from the small rocky asteroids associated with Vesta collisions. Dawn spent nearly 14 months orbiting Vesta, the second most massive object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, from 2011 to 2012. It is heading towards Ceres, the largest member of the asteroid belt. When Dawn arrives, it will be the first spacecraft to go into orbit around two destinations in our solar system beyond Earth.

The team determined the source of the problems, corrected them, and then resumed normal ion thrusting on Monday night, Sept. 15. \"This anomaly presented the team with an intricate and elaborate puzzle to solve,\" said Robert Mase, Dawn project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. After investigating what caused the spacecraft to enter safe mode, the Dawn team determined that it was likely triggered by the same phenomenon that affected Dawn three years ago on approach to the protoplanet Vesta: An electrical component in the ion propulsion system was disabled by a high-energy particle of radiation. \"We followed the same strategy that we implemented three years ago to recover from a similar radiation strike -- to swap to one of the other ion engines and a different electronic controller so we could resume thrusting quickly,\" said Dawn Mission Director and Chief Engineer Marc Rayman of JPL. \"We have a plan in place to revive this disabled component later this year.\" Complicating the issue, the team discovered that the spacecraft had experienced not just one anomaly, but also a second one that affected the ability to point the main antenna at Earth to communicate.

The cause of this issue has not yet been specifically pinpointed but it could be explained by a corruption to the software running in the main computer by a high-energy particle. Pointing performance went back to normal after a full computer reset restored the antenna to the correct orientation. Dawn is currently on its way to the largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres. Dawn is expected to enter into orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres in April 2015, a month later than originally planned. This is due to the inconvenient change in the thrust plan, but should not affect the spacecraft's plans for exploring Ceres once in orbit. Dawn is NASA's first scientific mission powered by solar electronic ion propulsion, which is noted on Orbital's Dawn factsheet as \"the world's most advanced and efficient space propulsion technology.\" The spacecraft is about 65 feet (20 meters) long and weighs 2,668 lbs (1,210 kg) at launch. Dawn is powered by Gallium Arsenide triple junction solar arrays, and uses three gimbaled NSTAR ion engines and monopropellant reaction control system for solar-electric propulsion. It is expected to function for a mission life of 10 years. Dawn was launched September 27, 2007 from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17-B on a Delta II-Heavy rocket- the strongest rocket in the Delta II class. Three stages and nine solid-fueled booster rockets sent the spacecraft on its way to the asteroid belt. The 9.5-foot payload fairing protected the Dawn spacecraft from stresses of launch. Its mission was to explore Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres. There are three principal scientific drivers behind Dawn's mission objectives, these are: \"first that it captures the earliest moments in the origin of the solar system enabling us to understand the conditions under which these objects formed. Second, Dawn determines the nature of the building blocks from which the terrestrial planets formed, improving our understanding of this formation. Finally, it contrasts the formation and evolution of two small planets that followed very different evolutionary paths so that we understand what controls that evolution.\" Dawn orbited Vesta, the second largest object in the asteroid belt, from July 2011 until September 2012. The spacecraft's ion propulsion system enabled it to spiral away from Vesta and towards its next destination, Ceres. At that point it will become the first spacecraft to go into orbit around two destinations in our solar system beyond Earth.", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/solar-system/dawn-experiences-complications-way-ceres/"}, {"title": "Dawn Journal: Update on trek from Vesta to Ceres", "date": "2014-12-06", "content": "Flying silently and smoothly through the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the Dawn spacecraft emits a blue-green beam of high velocity xenon ions. On the opposite side of the sun from Earth, firing its uniquely efficient ion propulsion system, the distant adventurer is continuing to make good progress on its long trek from the giant protoplanet Vesta to dwarf planet Ceres. This month, let's look ahead to some upcoming activities. You can use the sun in December to locate Dawn in the sky, but before we describe that, let's see how Dawn is looking ahead to Ceres, with plans to take pictures on the night of Dec. 1 The robotic explorer's sensors are complex devices that perform many sensitive measurements. To ensure they yield the best possible scientific data, their health must be carefully monitored and maintained, and they must be accurately calibrated. The sophisticated instruments are activated and tested occasionally, and all remain in excellent condition. One final calibration of the science camera is needed before arrival at Ceres. To accomplish it, the camera needs to take pictures of a target that appears just a few pixels across. The endless sky that surrounds our interplanetary traveler is full of stars, but those beautiful pinpoints of light, while easily detectable, are too small for this specialized measurement. But there is an object that just happens to be the right size. On Dec. 1, Ceres will be about nine pixels in diameter, nearly perfect for this calibration. The images will provide data on very subtle optical properties of the camera that scientists will use when they analyze and interpret the details of some of the pictures returned from orbit. At 740,000 miles, Dawn's distance to Ceres will be about three times the separation between Earth and the moon. Its camera, designed for mapping Vesta and Ceres from orbit, will not reveal anything new. It will, however, reveal something cool! The pictures will be the first extended view for the first probe to reach the first dwarf planet discovered. They will show the largest body between the sun and Pluto that has not yet been visited by a spacecraft, Dawn's destination since it climbed out of Vesta's gravitational grip more than two years ago. This will not be the first time Dawn has spotted Ceres. In a different calibration of the camera more than four years ago, the explorer descried its faint destination, far away in both time and space. Back then, still a year before arriving at Vesta, Dawn was more than 1,300 times farther from Ceres than it will be for this new calibration. The giant of the main asteroid belt was an indistinct dot in the vast cosmic landscape. Now Ceres is the brightest object in Dawn's sky save the distant sun. When it snaps the photos, Ceres will be as bright as Venus sometimes appears from Earth. To conserve hydrazine, a precious resource following the loss of two reaction wheels, Dawn will thrust with its ion propulsion system when it performs this calibration, which requires long exposures. In addition to moving the spacecraft along in its trajectory, the ion engine stabilizes the ship, enabling it to point steadily in the zero-gravity of spaceflight. As Dawn closes in on its quarry, Ceres will grow brighter and larger. Last month we summarized the plan for photographing Ceres during the first part of the approach phase, yielding views in January comparable to the best we currently have and in February significantly better. The principal purpose of the pictures is to help navigators steer the ship into this uncharted, final port following a long voyage on the interplanetary seas. The camera serves as the helmsman's eyes. Ceres has been observed with telescopes from Earth for more than two centuries, but it has appeared as little more than a faint, fuzzy blob farther away than the sun. But not for much longer! The only spaceship ever built to orbit two extraterrestrial destinations, Dawn's advanced ion propulsion system enables its ambitious mission. Providing the merest whisper of thrust, the ion engine allows Dawn to maneuver in ways entirely different from conventional spacecraft. In January, we presented in detail Dawn's unique way of slipping into orbit. In September, a burst of space radiation disrupted the thrust profile. As we saw, the flight team responded swiftly to a very complex problem, minimizing the duration of the missed thrust. One part of their contingency operations was to design a new approach trajectory, accounting for the 95 hours that Dawn coasted instead of thrust. Let's take a look now at how the resulting trajectory differs from what we discussed at the beginning of this year. In the original approach, Dawn would follow a simple spiral around Ceres, approaching from the general direction of the sun, looping over the south pole, going beyond to the night side, and coming back above the north pole before easing into the targeted orbit, known by the stirring name RC3, at an altitude of 8,400 miles. Like a pilot landing a plane, flying this route required lining up on a particular course and speed well in advance. The ion thrusting this year had been setting Dawn up to get on that approach spiral early next year. The change in its flight profile following the September encounter with a rogue cosmic ray meant the spiral path would be markedly different and would require significantly longer to complete. While the flight team certainly is patient - after all, Earth's robotic ambassador won't reach Ceres until 213 years after its discovery and more than seven years after launch - the brilliantly creative navigators devised an entirely new approach trajectory that would be shorter. Demonstrating the extraordinary flexibility of ion propulsion, the spacecraft now will take a completely different path but will wind up in exactly the same orbit. The spacecraft will allow itself to be captured by Ceres on March 6, only about half a day later than the trajectory it was pursuing before the hiatus in thrust, but the geometry both before and after will be quite different. Instead of flying south of Ceres, Dawn is now targeted to lead it, flying out ahead of it as the dwarf planet orbits the sun, and then the spacecraft will begin to gently curve around it. Dawn will come to 24,000 miles and then will slowly arc away. But thanks to the remarkable design of the thrust profile, the ion engine and the gravitational pull from the behemoth of rock and ice will work together. At a distance of 41,000 miles, Ceres will reach out and tenderly take hold of its new consort, and they will be together evermore. Dawn will be in orbit, and Ceres will forever be accompanied by this former resident of Earth. If the spacecraft stopped thrusting just when Ceres captured it, it would continue looping around the massive body in a high, elliptical orbit, but its mission is to scrutinize the mysterious world. Our goal is not to be in just any arbitrary orbit but rather in the particular orbits that have been chosen to provide the best scientific return for the probe's camera and other sensors. So it won't stop but instead will continue maneuvering to RC3. Ever graceful, Dawn will gently thrust to counter its orbital momentum, keeping it from swinging up to the highest altitude it would otherwise attain. On March 18, nearly two weeks after it is captured by Ceres' gravity, Dawn will arc to the crest of its orbit. Like a ball thrown high that slows to a momentary stop before falling back, Dawn's orbital ascent will end at an altitude of 47,000 miles, and Ceres' relentless pull will win out. As it begins descending toward its gravitational master, it will continue working with Ceres. Rather than resist the fall, the spacecraft will thrust to accelerate itself, quickening the trip down to RC3. There is more to the specification of the orbit than the altitude. One of the other attributes is the orientation of the orbit in space. To provide a view of the entire surface as Ceres rotates underneath it, Dawn needs to be in a polar orbit, flying over the north pole as it travels from the nightside to the dayside, moving south as it passes over the equator, sailing back to the unilluminated side when it reaches the south pole, and then heading north above terrain in the dark of night. To accomplish the earlier part of its new approach trajectory, however, Dawn will stay over lower latitudes, very high above the mysterious surface but not far from the equator. Therefore, as it races toward RC3, it will orient its ion engine not only to shorten the time to reach that orbital altitude but also to tip the plane of its orbit so that it encircles the poles. Then, finally, as it gets closer still, it will turn to use that famously efficient glowing beam of xenon ions against Ceres' gravity, acting as a brake rather than an accelerator. By April 23, this first act of a beautiful new celestial ballet will conclude. Dawn will be in the originally intended orbit around Ceres, ready for its next act: the intensive observations of RC3 we described in February. Dawn's route to orbit is no more complex and elegant than what any crackerjack spaceship pilot would execute. However, one of the key differences between what our ace will perform and what often happens in science fiction movies is that Dawn's maneuvers will comply with the laws of physics. And if that's not gratifying enough, perhaps the fact that it's real makes it even more impressive. A spaceship sent from Earth more than seven years ago, propelled by electrically accelerated ions, having already maneuvered extensively in orbit around the giant protoplanet Vesta to reveal its myriad secrets, soon will bank and roll, arc and turn, ascend and descend, and swoop into its planned orbit. And all this will take place far, far from Earth. Indeed, Dawn is on a very different heliocentric orbit from that of the planet it left behind in 2007. In December, their separate paths will take them to opposite sides of the sun. We will not have a similar celestial arrangement until 2016, by which time the craft will be in its lowest altitude orbit at Ceres. From our terrestrial perspective this year, Dawn will appear to be less than one solar diameter from the sun's limb on Dec. 9 and 10. As Earth, the sun, and the spacecraft come closer into alignment, radio signals that go back and forth must pass near the sun. The solar environment is fierce indeed, and it will interfere with those radio waves. While some signals will get through, communication will not be reliable. Therefore, controllers plan to send no messages to the spacecraft from Dec. 4 through Dec. 15; all instructions needed during that time will be stored onboard beforehand. Occasionally Deep Space Network antennas, pointing near the sun, will listen through the roaring noise for the faint whisper of the spacecraft, but the team will consider any communication to be a bonus. Dawn is big for an interplanetary spacecraft, with a wingspan of nearly 65 feet. However, more than 3.8 times as far as the sun, 352 million miles away, humankind lacks any technology even remotely capable of glimpsing it. But we can bring to bear something more powerful than our technology: our mind's eye. From Dec. 8 to 11, if you block the sun's blazing light with your thumb, you will also be covering Dawn's location. There, in that direction, is our faraway emissary to new worlds. It has traveled three billion miles already on its extraordinary extraterrestrial expedition, and some of the most exciting miles are still ahead as it nears Ceres. You can see right where it is. It is now on the far side of the sun. The sun! This is the same sun that is more than 100 times the diameter of Earth and a third of a million times its mass. This is the same sun that has been the unchallenged master of our solar system for more than 4.5 billion years. This is the same sun that has shone down on Earth all that time and has been the ultimate source of so much of the heat, light and other energy upon which the planet's residents have been so dependent. This is the same sun that has so influenced human expression in art, literature, mythology and religion for uncounted millennia. This is the same sun that has motivated scientific studies for centuries. This is the same sun that is our signpost in the Milky Way galaxy. And humans have a spacecraft on the far side of it. We may be humbled by our own insignificance in the universe, yet we still undertake the most valiant adventures in our attempts to comprehend its majesty. Dawn is 780,000 miles from Ceres, or 3.3 times the average distance between Earth and the moon. It is also 3.77 AU from Earth, or 1,525 times as far as the moon and 3.82 times as far as the sun today.

But Dawn's Ceres images will begin exceeding Hubble's resolution early next year, NASA officials said. NASA's Dawn spacecraft acquired this image of the dwarf planet Ceres on Dec. 1, 2014. A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset at lower left. The $466 million Dawn mission launched in September 2007 to study the two biggest objects in the asteroid belt, Ceres and the protoplanet Vesta, thereby revealing insights about our solar system's planet-building epoch nearly 4.6 billion years ago. Dawn orbited the 325-mile-wide Vesta from July 2011 through September 2012, beaming home a wealth of data about the body's composition and geological history before departing for Ceres, which is about 590 miles across. Vesta is currently about 104 million miles from Ceres. Ceres is the only one of the solar system's dwarf planets that lies in the asteroid belt. The rest, such as Pluto, orbit much farther away, in the icy Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune. Ceres intrigues astronomers for many reasons; for example, it's known to harbor water, which erupts into space, perhaps from \"ice geysers\" on the object's surface.

Dawn has officially entered the Ceres approach phase, after recently emerging from behind the sun relative to Earth and thus coming back into reliable communication range. The probe is now about 400,000 miles from Ceres and is cruising toward the 590-mile-wide object at 450 mph, NASA officials said. Dawn should enter orbit around Ceres - the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter - on March 6, 2015. When that happens, the spacecraft will become the first ever to orbit two different unexplored solar system bodies. Mission team members, and space scientists around the world, are eager to see Ceres up close. \"Ceres is almost a complete mystery to us,\" Dawn principal investigator Christopher Russell, of UCLA, said in a statement. \"Ceres, unlike Vesta, has no meteorites linked to it to help reveal its secrets. All we can predict with confidence is that we will be surprised.\" While Ceres and Vesta reside in the same general neighborhood, they appear to be quite different from each other. For example, the 325-mile-wide Vesta is thought to be a dry body, while Ceres possesses an icy mantle and might even harbor a subsurface ocean of liquid water. This difference may result from slightly different formation times. Scientists think Vesta came together a bit earlier than Ceres did, when radioactive material was more abundant in the solar system. Vesta's interior therefore likely incorporated more radioactive stuff, which generated more heat and drove away more water, NASA officials said. The $466 million Dawn mission does not rely on tradititional chemical thrusters but rather employs a super-efficient ion propulsion system, in which ionized xenon gas is accelerated out the back of the spacecraft to generate thrust. \"Orbiting both Vesta and Ceres would be truly impossible with conventional propulsion. Thanks to ion propulsion, we're about to make history as the first spaceship ever to orbit two unexplored alien worlds,\" Dawn chief engineer and mission director Marc Rayman, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in the same statement. While March 6 marks the beginning of orbital operations at Ceres, another milestone will come by the end of January: At that point, Dawn's photos will be the best ever captured of the dwarf planet, NASA officials said. Dawn launched in 2007 on a mission to learn more about the solar system's early days, and the planet-formation process, by studying Vesta and Ceres.

Almost eight years after blasting off from Cape Canaveral in Florida, and travelling 3bn miles, the $450m Dawn probe is due to arrive at Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt that separates Mars from Jupiter, on Friday 6 March. A technical glitch that knocked out thrusters on the ship in September means that Dawn has already overshot Ceres and must now swing back towards the 590-mile-wide ball of minerals and ice to enter the right orbit. On Sunday, it was 30,000 miles away from Ceres. Nasa probe spots mysterious shiny patches on dwarf planet CeresRead more If all goes to plan, the spacecraft will circle the dwarf planet for months, mapping its surface and measuring changes in its gravitational field, from which scientists can glean crucial insights about the body's interior. Early observations of Ceres already have astronomers enthralled. The dwarf planet is thought to have a rocky core encased in more than 62 miles of subterranean ice. If Dawn confirms this, it will mean the body holds more fresh water than the whole of the Earth's surface. On its approach to Ceres, Dawn's camera revealed a bright patch on the otherwise dark and dull, carbon-rich terrain. But in higher resolution pictures released last week, the patch was found to be two spots: one very bright, the other dimmer. What the spots are is unclear. They may be ice patches, shiny silicates on the surface, or reflective impact material left after a hit-and-run collision by another space rock. Ceres is not thought to be geologically active, but if its innards are still stirring, the bright spots may be eruptions from ice volcanoes. The Dawn probe was flung into space in September 2007 to learn about the formation of the planets at the birth of the solar system 4.6bn years ago. The boulders drifting in the asteroid belt are the primordial material from which all planets are made. Some, like Ceres, became large by asteroid standards, but ultimately they are failed planets. Their growth was disrupted by the intense gravitational pull of Jupiter, which scattered the asteroids like billiard balls. When Dawn arrives in orbit around Ceres, at a distance of more than 249m miles from the sun, it will become the first spacecraft to have circled two different bodies in deep space. Four years into its journey, in 2011, Dawn caught up with Vesta, the brightest asteroid in the solar system and the only one visible to the naked eye. Dawn's 14-month survey of Vesta, a rock roughly half the size of Ceres, revealed it to be similar to the inner planets of the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Like Earth, Vesta has an iron core, surrounded by a mantle and crust. The surface is scarred with giant canyons and craters punch deep into its surface. One pit is 311 miles across and has at its centre a mountain that rises up more than twice as high as Mount Everest. Ceres is a different beast. The first asteroid to be discovered, it was spotted by accident on new year's day in 1801 by the Italian monk Giuseppe Piazzi of the Palermo observatory. Unlike Vesta, the makeup of Ceres is far more like the icy bodies in the outer solar system. About one-quarter of its mass is water, and some may be liquid under the surface. The International Astronomical Union designated Ceres a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006, along with Pluto, which found itself demoted from full planetary status. Dwarf planets must orbit the sun and be massive enough to be shaped by their gravity, but, unlike proper planets, have not cleared a path through the solar system. \"We think that the building blocks of Earth were the siblings of Ceres and Vesta,\" said Christopher Russell, the lead scientist on the Dawn mission at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"Those like Vesta came to Earth and delivered the iron core, and other materials, while others, like Ceres, brought water.\" Last year, Michael K\u00fcppers, a planetary scientist at the European Space Astronomy Centre in Villanueva de la Ca\u00f1ada, Spain, reported observations for the Herschel space telescope, which found jets of water vapour coming from Ceres. Every second, the dwarf planet loses 6kg in steam. K\u00fcppers hopes that Dawn will shed light on the source of the steam plumes. One possibility is that part of the crust was knocked off Ceres in a cosmic impact, exposing hard ice beneath, which vaporises in sunlight. But the interior of Ceres may still be active, and driving out gas from inside. Andreas Nathues, the lead scientist on Dawn's framing camera at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, said the mission targeted Vesta and Ceres because they were so unlike each other. \"Why is Ceres a body that contains water, and Vesta not? Why are they so different? Understanding that will help us understand how the planets formed,\" he said. The Dawn probe is powered by an ion thruster that forces xenon plasma out of the spacecraft at 77,670mph and can run continuously for years, accelerating the craft over time. In September, the thruster failed when a highly energetic particle slammed into its electronics, forcing the probe into safe mode for four days. The loss of power means that, while Dawn will arrive at Ceres on time, it will take weeks to correct its orientation and point its cameras at the surface. \"We'll be pointing in the wrong direction when we get there,\" said Russell. \"We have a period coming up where we won't be taking much data, but we will get the next set of good pictures at the end of April.\" Some of those images could resolve the mystery of the bright spots on the surface of Ceres. Russell suspects that as the images from Dawn get sharper, the spots could become smaller and shinier, until they reflect nearly all the sunlight falling on them. \"In a few months, the reflectivity may get to 100%, and that could mean water ice,\" he said. When the mission is over later this year, the Dawn probe will remain in orbit around Ceres at a safe enough distance to ensure it does not crash into the surface. Since Ceres has no atmosphere, there is no drag to bring Dawn spiralling down to the dwarf planet's surface. \"We are about to arrive. And when we do, we are at Ceres to stay,\" said Russell.

NASA's Dawn probe arrived at Ceres today at about 7:39 a.m. EST, becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a dwarf planet. Dawn's observations over the next 16 months should lift the veil on Ceres, which has remained largely mysterious since it was first spotted more than two centuries ago. \"Since its discovery in 1801, Ceres was known as a planet, then an asteroid and later a dwarf planet,\" Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, who's based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. \"Now, after a journey of 3.1 billion miles and 7.5 years, Dawn calls Ceres 'home.'\" NASA officials got a signal from Dawn confirming that it's healthy and in orbit at about 8:36 a.m. EST today. The milestone comes just four months ahead of another highly anticipated dwarf-planet encounter: On July 14, NASA's New Horizons probe will zoom through the Pluto system, giving scientists their first good looks at that faraway dwarf planet and its five known moons. The $473 million Dawn mission launched in September 2007 to study Vesta and Ceres, the two largest objects in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Vesta's diameter is 330 miles, while Ceres is about 590 miles wide. Both Vesta and Ceres are leftovers from the solar system's early days, planetary building blocks that would likely have kept growing if not for the interfering influence of Jupiter's immense gravitational tug. The two bodies are \"intact protoplanets from the very dawn of the solar system,\" Dawn Deputy Principal Investigator Carol Raymond, also of JPL, said during a news conference Monday .\" So they're literally fossils that we can investigate to really understand the processes that were going on at that time.\" Dawn orbited Vesta from July 2011 through September 2012, when the probe departed for Ceres. So today's arrival made history in another way as well: Dawn became the first spacecraft ever to orbit two objects beyond the Earth- moon system. The mission's spaceflight feats are made possible by Dawn's innovative propulsion system, which accelerates xenon ions out the back of the spacecraft. This process generates tiny amounts of thrust; it would take Dawn four days to go from 0 to 60 mph, team members have said. But Dawn's ion drive is about 10 times more efficient than traditional chemical systems. So the engines can keep firing for weeks, months and years, accelerating Dawn to tremendous speeds. \"With the 1,000 lbs. 454 kilograms of xenon propellant that was loaded on board, Dawn has already accomplished more than 24,000 mph 38,624 km/h of velocity change,\" Dawn project manager Robert Mase of JPL said during Monday's news conference. \"To put that in context: That's more than it takes to get a vehicle from the surface of the Earth up to the International Space Station.\" Thanks to ion propulsion, Dawn crept up on Ceres slowly and gradually. The probe eased into orbit today without the need for any harrowing make-or-break maneuvers. Ceres is an intriguing world that in many ways looks more like the icy moons of the outer solar system, such as Jupiter's satellite Europa and the Saturn moon Enceladus, than its rocky neighbors in the asteroid belt. For example, the dwarf planet is thought to consist of 25 to 30 percent water by mass, mostly in the form of ice. Ceres may also once have had an ocean of liquid water beneath its surface, as Europa and Enceladus are thought to. Indeed, some researchers believe Ceres may be capable of supporting microbial life. \"It's really going to be exciting to see what this exotic, alien world looks like,\" Rayman told Space.com in late January. \"We're finally going to learn about this place.\" Dawn is not equipped to search for signs of life. But the probe might be able to spot evidence of an underground ocean, if it burbles up in places to interact with surface rocks, Rayman said. Measurements of Ceres' surface temperatures, when coupled with models of heat transportation through Ceres, could also shed light on the question of underground liquid water, said Dawn principal investigator Chris Russell of UCLA. Dawn will also investigate two Ceres mysteries that have cropped up in the past year or so. Mission scientists will try to figure out just what is producing Ceres' mysterious bright spots, and they'll attempt to confirm and characterize a tenuous water-vapor plume spotted recently by researchers using Europe's Herschel Space Observatory. Overall, Dawn will characterize the dwarf planet in detail, mapping out its surface and determining what Ceres is made of, among other tasks. \"We'll do typical planetary geology, more similar to what we do on Mars than what we did with Vesta ,\" Russell told Space.com. This work will not start immediately; Dawn will spend the next six weeks spiraling down to its initial science orbit, getting there on April 23. The probe will then begin taking Ceres' measure from an altitude of 8,400 miles. Dawn will study the dwarf planet from a series of increasingly closer-in orbits until the mission ends in June 2016. While Ceres and Pluto are both dwarf planets - a category created by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, when it demoted Pluto from a full-fledged planet in a decision that remains controversial today - they're quite different from each other, Russell said. \"Pluto formed differently, formed at a different time and formed out of different materials\" than Ceres, he said. Pluto is also more than twice as wide as Ceres and lies more than 14 times farther from the sun than the queen of the asteroid belt does. So the data returned by Dawn and New Horizons will likely not paint a unifying picture of just what it means to be a dwarf planet, Russell said. \"The legacy of the two missions is freeing these bodies from arbitrary labels based on their size or their ability to scatter other objects, or whatever the IAU had going through its head,\" he said. \"These bodies are being liberated from classification, and we now can understand them in their own right.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/28754-nasa-dawn-ceres-dwarf-planet-arrival.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Dawn becomes first probe to orbit dwarf planet", "date": "2015-03-06", "content": "It's a small new world. At 0439 Pacific Standard Time, NASA's Dawn spacecraft entered orbit around Ceres, a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt.

The spacecraft was captured by the dwarf planet's gravity when it was around 61,000 kilometres away, but will continue to spiral closer in over the next year and a half. It was not a direct flight. Dawn travelled via the asteroid Vesta, which it visited from 2011 to 2012, making it the first spacecraft to have called at two different worlds.

It will take detailed images of the dwarf planet, and produce a geological map of its entire surface. But even before the spacecraft has reached its optimum orbit, the preliminary results just released are already surprising and delighting planetary scientists. Up until February 2015, the best images taken of Ceres were from the Hubble space telescope, showing a near-spherical body with one area that was much brighter than the rest of the surface. As Dawn approached Ceres, its camera acquired some remarkable images, at about three times the resolution of those from Hubble. The pictures verified that there was indeed a brighter region. Even better, close examination of the images showed that the area varied in brightness over the course of Ceres' day, growing dimmer as the dwarf planet moved into darkness. It is interpretation of this variability that has planetary scientists buzzing. As if that were not enough, a further series of pictures appear to show a plume emanating from the surface. Is Ceres active? Does it have a layer of water or ice below a thin crust of rock? Could it be a ball of mud, overlain by a muddy ocean, on top of which is another thin muddy crust? The exact structure of Ceres is not yet known, although it is clear that it's not rocky all the way through - its density is too low, so there must be at least some water or ice present. Suggestions at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas, of icy volcanism on Ceres have led to speculation that the dwarf planet could potentially be habitable. Although Ceres does not have an atmosphere, life might exist in a subsurface ocean, as has been suggested for Europa or Enceladus, moons orbiting Jupiter and Saturn respectively. Cryovolcanism - the presence of ice volcanoes - is not the only mechanism that can produce a plume of dust and ice from a planetary surface. The Rosetta mission has delivered amazing images of plumes coming from comet P/67 Churyumov- Gerasimenko, caused by sublimation of ice that releases dust and gas trapped inside the ice. Could the bright spot be an icy plume caused by the vaporisation of Ceres' surface as it turns towards the sun's heat, and then dropping away as night falls? Corridor talk at the conference speculates that Ceres might be closer to a comet than the asteroid it is usually regarded as. Fortunately, we won't have to wait much longer before we get some more definitive answers to questions of Ceres' physical structure and heritage. By the beginning of April, the Dawn spacecraft will be much closer and will start its imaging campaign in earnest, at which point we will start seeing craters and other surface features at better resolution. In preparation for descriptions of such features, and bearing in mind that Ceres was the Roman goddess of the harvest, the International Astronomical Union has ruled that craters on Ceres should be named after international deities of agriculture and vegetation, while other features will be named after agricultural festivals of the world. I'm not sure just how many of these there are, or how memorable their names will turn out to be. But as the Dawn mission's principal investigator Chris Russell pointed out, there is one Mayan deity named Yum, god of agriculture and the jungle), who should readily be remembered. One can only hope the mission scientists find a suitably delicious feature on Ceres to give that name.

Dawn captured the image on May 23, when the probe was just 3,200 miles from Ceres. The photo's resolution is about 1,600 feet per pixel, scientists said. \"The view shows numerous secondary craters, formed by the re-impact of debris strewn from larger impact sites. Smaller surface details like this are becoming visible with increasing clarity as Dawn spirals lower in its campaign to map Ceres,\" NASA officials wrote in an image description today. \"The region shown here is located between 13 degrees and 51 degrees north latitude and 182 degrees and 228 degrees east longitude,\" they added. \"The image has been projected onto a globe of Ceres, which accounts for the small notch of black at upper right.\" NASA's Dawn spacecraft captured this image of the dwarf planet Ceres' heavily cratered surface on May 23, 2015, from a distance of 3,200 miles. The $473 million Dawn mission launched in September 2007 to study Vesta and Ceres, the two largest objects in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Vesta and Ceres are planetary building blocks left over from the solar system's early days, so Dawn's observations should help researchers better understand how rocky worlds like Earth and Mars formed and grew, NASA officials have said. Dawn orbited the 330-mile-wide Vesta from July 2011 through September 2012 and reached Ceres, which is 590 miles across, this March. In the process, Dawn became the first spacecraft to orbit two objects beyond the Earth-moon system, as well as the first to circle a dwarf planet. Dawn is studying Ceres from a series of progressively closer-in orbits. The craft's first science orbit lay about 8,400 miles from the dwarf planet's surface; Dawn is currently spiraling down to a 2,700-mile-high orbit, which it should reach on June 3. By the time Dawn wraps up its mission in June 2016, it will be eyeing Ceres' intriguing surface from just 230 miles away.

Having already obtained a treasure trove from its first mapping orbit, Dawn is now seeking even greater riches at dwarf planet Ceres as it maneuvers to its second orbit. The first intensive mapping campaign was extremely productive. As the spacecraft circled 8,400 miles above the alien terrain, one orbit around Ceres took 15 days. During its single revolution, the probe observed its new home on five occasions from April 24 to May 8. When Dawn was flying over the night side, it looked first at the illuminated crescent of the southern hemisphere and later at the northern hemisphere. When Dawn traveled over the sunlit side, it watched the northern hemisphere, then the equatorial regions, and finally the southern hemisphere as Ceres rotated beneath it each time. One Cerean day, the time it takes the globe to turn once on its axis, is about nine hours, much shorter than the time needed for the spacecraft to loop around its orbit. So it was almost as if Dawn hovered in place, moving only slightly as it peered down, and its instruments could record all of the sights as they paraded by. We described the plans in much more detail in March, and they executed beautifully, yielding a rich collection of photos in visible and near infrared wavelengths, spectra in visible and infrared, and measurements of the strength of Ceres' gravitational attraction and hence its mass. To gain the same view Dawn had, simply build your own ion- propelled spaceship, voyage deep into the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, take up residence at the giant orb and look out the window. Or go to the image gallery here. Either way, the sights are spectacular. And they have already gotten even better. As Dawn has been descending to its second mapping orbit, it paused ion-thrusting on May 16 and May 22 to take more pictures, helping navigators get a tight fix on its orbital location. We explained this technique of optical navigation earlier, but now it is slightly different. Dawn is so close to Ceres that the behemoth fills the camera's field of view. No longer charting Ceres' location relative to background stars, navigators now use distinctive features on Ceres itself. It was an indistinct, fuzzy little blob just a few months ago, but now the maps are becoming detailed and accurate. Mathematical analyses of the locations of specific landmarks in each picture allow navigators to determine where Dawn was when the picture was taken. Let's see how this works. Suppose I gave you a picture I had taken in your house. Because you know the positions of the doors, windows, furniture, impact craters, paintings, etc., you could establish where I had been when I took the photo. Now that they have charted the positions of the features at Dawn's new home, navigators can do virtually the same thing. In addition to aiding in celestial navigation, the photos provided still better views of the world Dawn traveled so long and so far to explore. Greater and greater detail is visible as Dawn orbits closer, and a tremendous variety of intriguing sights are coming into view. It may well be that the most interesting discoveries have not even been made yet, but for now, what captivates most people are the bright spots. We have discussed them here and there in recent months, and their luminous power continues to dazzle us. What appeared initially as one fuzzy spot proved to be two smaller spots and now many even smaller regions as the focus has become sharper. Why the ground there reflects so much sunlight remains elusive. Dawn's finer examinations with its suite of sophisticated instruments in the second, third and then final mapping orbits will provide scientists with data they need to unravel this marvelous mystery. For now, the enigmatic lights present an irresistible cosmic invitation to go closer and to scrutinize this strange and wonderful world, and we are eager to accept. After all, we explore to learn, to know the unknown, and the uniquely powerful scientific method will reveal the nature of the bright areas and what they can tell us about the composition and geology of this complex dwarf planet. After having been viewed as little more than a smudge in telescopes for more than two centuries since its discovery, Ceres now is seen as a detailed, three-dimensional world. As promised, measurements from Dawn have revised the size to be about 599 miles across at the equator. Like Earth and other planets, Ceres is oblate, or slightly wider at the equator than from pole to pole. The polar diameter is 554 miles. These dimensions are impressively close to what astronomers had determined from telescopic observations and confirm Ceres to be the colossus we have described. Before Dawn, scientists had estimated Ceres' mass to be 1.04 billion billion tons. Now it is measured to be 1.03 billion billion tons, well within the previous margin of error. It is an impressive demonstration of the success of science that astronomers had been able to determine the heft of that point of light so accurately. Nevertheless, even this small change of less than one percent is important for planning the rest of Dawn's mission as it orbits closer and closer, feeling the gravitational tug ever more strongly. Let's put this change in context. Dawn has now refined the mass, making a proportionally small adjustment of about 0.01 billion billion tons. Although no more than a tweak on the overall value, it is still significantly greater than the combined mass of all asteroids visited by all other spacecraft. Ceres is so immense, so massive that even if all those asteroids were added to it, the difference would hardly even have been noticeable. This serves as another reminder that the dwarf planet really is quite unlike the millions of small asteroids that constitute the main asteroid belt. This behemoth contains about 30 percent of all the mass in that entire vast region of space. Vesta, the protoplanet Dawn orbited and studied in 2011-2012, is the second most massive resident there, holding about 8 percent of the asteroid belt's mass. Dawn by itself is exploring around 40 percent of the asteroid belt's mass! Upon concluding its first mapping orbit, Dawn powered on its remarkable ion propulsion system on May 9 to fly down to a lower altitude where it will gain a better view. We examined the nature of the spiral paths between mapping orbits last year. In its first mapping orbit, Dawn was 8,400 miles high, revolving once in 15.2 days at a speed of 150 mph. By the time it completes this descent, the probe will be at an altitude of 2,700 miles, orbiting Ceres every 3.1 days at 254 mph. We have discussed that lower orbits require greater velocity to counterbalance the stronger gravitational hold. Dawn's uniquely capable ion propulsion system, with its extraordinary combination of efficiency and gentleness, propels the ship to its new orbital destination in just under four weeks. The descent requires five revolutions, each one faster than the one before. The flight profile is complicated, and sometimes Dawn even dips below the final, planned altitude and then rises to greater heights as it flies on a path that is temporarily elliptical. The overall trend, of course, is downward. As Dawn heads for its targeted circular orbit, its maneuvering is also generally reducing the orbit period, the time required to make one complete revolution around Ceres. Indeed, if Dawn stopped thrusting now, its orbit period would be about 83 hours, or 3.5 days. Dawn will complete ion-thrusting on June 3, but it will not be ready to begin its next science observations then. Rather, as in the other new mapping orbits, the first order of business will be for navigators to measure the new orbital parameters accurately. The flight team then will install in Dawn's main computer the details of the orbit it achieved so it will always know its location. In addition, the intensive campaign of observations is planned to begin when the robotic explorer travels from the night side to the day side over the north pole. With the three-day orbit period, that will next occur on June 5. Controllers will take advantage of the intervening time to conduct other activities, including routine maintenance of the two reaction wheels that remain operable, although they are powered off most of the time.. Dawn no longer relies on these devices to control its orientation, and it is remarkable that the mission can accomplish all of its original objectives without them. But if two do function in the final mapping orbit later this year, they will help extend the spacecraft's lifetime for bonus studies. We have already presented the ambitious plans for this second mapping orbit, sometimes known as \"the second mapping orbit\" and sometimes more succinctly and confusingly as \"survey orbit.\" As with all four of Dawn's mapping orbits, it is designed to take the spacecraft over the poles, ensuring the best possible coverage. The ship will fly from the north pole to the south over the side of Ceres facing the sun, and then loop back to the north over the side hidden in the deep dark of night. On the day side, Dawn will aim its camera and spectrometers at the lit ground, filling its memory to capacity with the readings. On the night side, it will point its main antenna to distant Earth in order to radio its findings home. At Dawn's altitude, Ceres will appear twice as wide as the camera's view., it will look about the size of a soccer ball seen from a yard, or a meter, away.) But as the dwarf planet rotates on its axis and Dawn sails around in its more leisurely orbit, eventually all of the landscape will come within sight of the instruments. Only one noteworthy change has been made in the intricate plans for survey orbit since May 2014's shocking expos\u00e9. With the observations starting on June 5, the subsequent complex orbital flight to the third mapping orbit would have begun on June 27. As we have seen, the rapidly changing orbit in the spiral descents requires a great deal of effort by the small operations team on a rigid schedule. The capable men and women flying Dawn accomplished the maneuvers flawlessly at Vesta and are well prepared for the challenges at Ceres. The work is very demanding, however, and so, just as at Vesta, the team has built into the strategy the capability to make adjustments to align most of the tasks with a conventional work schedule. The technical plans following the loss of the two reaction wheels) fully account for such human factors. It turns out that leaving survey orbit three days later shifts a significant amount of the following work off weekends, making it more comfortable for the team members. Three days is one complete revolution, and always extracting as much from the mission as possible, they have devised another full set of observations for an eighth orbit. As a result, survey orbit may be even more extensive and productive than originally anticipated. What awaits Dawn in the next mapping phase? The views will be three times as sharp as in the previous orbit, and exciting new discoveries are sure to come. What answers will be revealed? And what new questions will arise? We will know soon, as we all share in the thrill of this grand adventure. To help you keep track of Dawn's progress as it powers its way down and then conducts further observations, your correspondent writes brief mission status updates.

The new Ceres video, which NASA released today, was created using 80 images captured by the space agency's Dawn spacecraft. Some photos were taken from Dawn's first mapping orbit of the dwarf planet, which lay at an altitude of about 8,400 miles, while others are navigational shots snapped from 3,200 miles away, NASA officials said. \"We used a three-dimensional terrain model that we had produced based on the images acquired so far,\" Dawn team member Ralf Jaumann, of the German Aerospace Center in Berlin, said in a statement. \"They will become increasingly detailed as the mission progresses, with each additional orbit bringing us closer to the surface.\" The star field visible in the video was added during production, NASA officials said. The $466 million Dawn mission launched in September 2007 to study Vesta and Ceres, the two largest objects in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres is about 590 miles wide, while Vesta measures about 330 miles across. The two bodies are building blocks left over from the solar system's planet- formation period. So Dawn's observations should help scientists better understand how Earth and other rocky worlds were put together and reveal other insights about the solar system's early days, NASA officials have said.

The true nature of these bright areas will remain a mystery until Dawn can get closer and study the bright spots in more detail in coming months. In its closest orbit, Dawn's cameras will capture images with 36 times better detail than those it's currently transmitting. We recently sat down for a video interview with Dawn's top scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory here, who spoke about what the bright spots could mean. They say the dwarf planet could hold clues from billions of years in the past when Ceres was warmer and may have harbored a liquid ocean beneath its surface. One of the goals of the mission will be to determine whether the world was once capable of supporting life.

On Saturday, the space agency's Pluto-bound New Horizons spacecraft encountered an anomaly that caused the probe to stop communicating and switch to its backup computer. And now, it looks like NASA's Dawn spacecraft - which is currently orbiting above dwarf planet Ceres - also suffered an anomaly in its system on June 30th that caused it to go into safe mode. Fortunately for NASA, both of the issues were resolved relatively quickly. Space agency officials noted that they discovered the source of the New Horizons glitch within a few hours and were able to get the spacecraft back operating on its main computer by Sunday. As a result, a few scientific observations were lost over the weekend. NASA claims neither the probe's hardware nor its software were damaged during the incident. New Horizons resumed its normal scientific operations today and is still on track for its July 14th flyby of Pluto. As for Dawn, NASA says the spacecraft experienced its anomaly as the probe was preparing to move to another orbit configuration around Ceres. When Dawn turned on its ion engines, the probe detected a glitch in the software that controls its orientation. The vehicle responded much like New Horizons did - by switching to its backup computer. Engineers have since been able to return Dawn back to its normal operating mode, but the spacecraft will remain in its old mapping orbit until the flight team figures out what went wrong.

Here are some early images from that closer orbit. The images on this page were released yesterday. The first two show an area close to Ceres' equator, looking straight down. What you are seeing here is a curious 6,000-meter / 19,400-foot tall mountain, seen from directly overhead. The mountain is 9 miles wide. The summit area is clearly very rough, not so obvious from the much higher Survey Orbit, which Dawn just left. The streaks do not extend around the entire base, an areas on the slopes on the south east flanks are cratered. I have rotated the images so North is top. What does show is that the streaks do not appear to end with slumped material at the mountain's base. Perhaps LAMO - beginning mid-December, 2015 - will show if this is really so. By the way, Ceres itself is only 599 miles wide. Many craters on Ceres appear doubled, much like the paired craters also seen on 4 Vesta, as well as much smaller asteroids 243 Ida and 253 Mathilde.

It was conceived and built there by creatures curious and bold, with an insatiable yearning to reach out and know the cosmos. Under their guidance, it left Earth behind as its Delta rocket dispatched it on an ambitious mission to explore two of the last uncharted worlds in the inner solar system. As Earth continued circling the sun once a year, now having completed eight revolutions since its celestial ambassador departed, Dawn has accomplished a remarkable interplanetary journey. The adventurer spent most of its anniversaries powering its way through the solar system, using its advanced and uniquely capable ion propulsion system to reshape its orbit around the sun. On its way to the main asteroid belt, it sailed past Mars, taking some of the that red planet's orbital energy to boost its own solar orbit. On its fourth anniversary, the probe was locked in orbit around the giant protoplanet Vesta, the second most massive object between Mars and Jupiter. Dawn's pictures and other data showed it to be a complex, fascinating world, more closely related to the terrestrial planets than to the much smaller asteroids. Today, on the eighth anniversary of venturing into the cosmos, Dawn is once again doing what it does best. In the permanent gravitational embrace of dwarf planet Ceres, orbiting at an altitude of 915 miles, Dawn is using its suite of sophisticated sensors to scrutinize this mysterious, alien orb. Ceres was the first dwarf planet ever sighted, but it had to wait more than two centuries before Earth accepted its celestial invitation. The only spacecraft ever to orbit two extraterrestrial destinations, this interplanetary spaceship arrived at Ceres in March to take up residence. Although this is the final anniversary during its scheduled primary mission, Dawn will remain in orbit around its new home far, far into the future. Later this year it will spiral down to its fourth and final orbital altitude at about 230 miles. Once there, it will record spectra of neutrons, gamma rays, and visible and infrared light, measure the distribution of mass inside Ceres, and take pictures. Then when it exhausts its supply of hydrazine next year, as it surely will, the mission will end. We have discussed before that despite the failure of two reaction wheels, devices previously considered indispensable for the expedition, the hardy ship has excellent prospects now for fulfilling and even exceeding its many goals in exploring Ceres. Last month we described the plans for Dawn's penultimate mapping phase at the dwarf planet, and it is going very well. The probe is already more than halfway through this third orbital phase at Ceres, which is divided into six mapping cycles. Each 11-day cycle requires a dozen flights over the illuminated hemisphere to allow the camera to map the entire surface. Each map is made by looking at a different angle. Taken together then, they provide stereo views, so scientists gain perspectives that allow them to construct topographical maps. The camera's internal computer detected an unexpected condition in the third cycle of this phase, and that caused the loss of some of the pictures. But experienced mission planners had designed all of the major mapping phases with more observations than are needed to meet their objectives, so the deletion of those images was not significant. At this moment, the spacecraft is nearing the end of its fourth mapping cycle, making its tenth flight over the side of Ceres lit by the sun. You can follow Dawn's progress by using your own interplanetary spaceship to snoop into its activities in orbit around the distant world, by tapping into the radio signals beamed back and forth across the solar system between Dawn and the giant antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network, or by checking the frequent mission status reports. You also can see the marvelous sights by visiting the Ceres image gallery. Among the most captivating is Occator crater. As the spacecraft has produced ever finer pictures this year, starting with its distant observations in January, the light reflecting from the interior of this crater has dazzled us. The latest pictures show 260 times as much detail. Dawn has transformed what was so recently just a bright spot into a complex and beautiful gleaming landscape. Last month we asked what these mesmerizing features would reveal when photographed from this the present altitude, and now we know. Scientists are continuing to analyze Dawn's pictures and other data not only from Occator but all of Ceres to learn more about the nature of this exotic relict from the dawn of the solar system. Many deep questions are unanswered and remain mystifying, but of one point there can be no doubt: the scenery is beautiful. Even now, the photos speak for themselves, displaying wondrous sights on a world shaped both by its own complex internal geological processes as well as by external forces from more than 4.5 billion years in the rough and tumble main asteroid belt. Because the pictures speak for themselves, your correspondent will speak for the mission. So now, as every Sep. 27, let's take a broader look at Dawn's deep-space trek. For those who would like to track the probe's progress in the same terms used on past anniversaries, we present here the eighth annual summary, reusing text from previous years with updates where appropriate. Readers who wish to reflect upon Dawn's ambitious journey may find it helpful to compare this material with the logs from its first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh anniversaries. In its eight years of interplanetary travels, the spacecraft has thrust for a total of 1,976 days, or 68 percent of the time. While for most spacecraft, firing a thruster to change course is a special event, it is Dawn's wont. All this thrusting has cost the craft only 873 pounds of its supply of xenon propellant, which was 937 pounds on Sep. 27, 2007. The spacecraft has used 66 of the 71 gallons of xenon it carried when it rode its rocket from Earth into space. The thrusting since then has achieved the equivalent of accelerating the probe by 24,400 mph. As previous logs have described for one of the more extensive discussions), because of the principles of motion for orbital flight, whether around the sun or any other gravitating body, Dawn is not actually traveling this much faster than when it launched. But the effective change in speed remains a useful measure of the effect of any spacecraft's propulsive work. Having accomplished 98 percent of the thrust time planned for its entire mission, Dawn has far exceeded the velocity change achieved by any other spacecraft under its own power. The principal ion thrusting that remains is to maneuver from the present orbit to the final one from late October to mid-December. Since launch, our readers who have remained on or near Earth have completed eight revolutions around the sun, covering 50.3 AU. Orbiting farther from the sun, and thus moving at a more leisurely pace, Dawn has traveled 35.0 AU. As it climbed away from the sun, up the solar system hill, to match its orbit to that of Vesta, it continued to slow down to Vesta's speed. It had to go even slower to perform its graceful rendezvous with Ceres. In the eight years since Dawn began its voyage, Vesta has traveled only 32.7 AU, and the even more sedate Ceres has gone 26.8 AU. Another way to investigate the progress of the mission is to chart how Dawn's orbit around the sun has changed. This discussion will culminate with a few more numbers than we usually include, and readers who prefer not to indulge may skip this material, leaving that much more for the grateful Numerivores. In order to make the table below comprehensible, we recycle some more text here on the nature of orbits. Orbits are ellipses. So as members of the solar system family follow their paths around the sun, they sometimes move closer and sometimes move farther from it. In addition to orbits being characterized by shape, or equivalently by the amount of flattening, and by size, they may be described in part by how they are oriented in space. Using the bias of terrestrial astronomers, the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun is a good reference. Other planets and interplanetary spacecraft may travel in orbits that are tipped at some angle to that. The angle between the ecliptic and the plane of another body's orbit around the sun is the inclination of that orbit. Vesta and Ceres do not orbit the sun in the same plane that Earth does, and Dawn must match its orbit to that of its targets. Now we can see how Dawn has done by considering the size and shape and inclination of its orbit on each of its anniversaries. The table below shows what the orbit would have been if the spacecraft had terminated ion thrusting on its anniversaries; the orbits of its destinations, Vesta and Ceres, are included for comparison. Of course, when Dawn was on the launch pad on Sep. 27, 2007, its orbit around the sun was exactly Earth's orbit. After launch, it was in its own solar orbit. For readers who are not overwhelmed by the number of numbers, investing the effort to study the table may help to demonstrate how Dawn has patiently transformed its orbit during the course of its mission. Note that four years ago, the spacecraft's path around the sun was exactly the same as Vesta's. Achieving that perfect match was, of course, the objective of the long flight that started in the same solar orbit as Earth, and that is how Dawn managed to slip into orbit around Vesta. While simply flying by it would have been far easier, matching orbits with Vesta required the exceptional capability of the ion propulsion system. Without that technology, NASA's Discovery Program would not have been able to afford a mission to explore the massive protoplanet in such detail. But now, Dawn has gone even beyond that. Having discovered so many of Vesta's secrets, the stalwart adventurer left it behind in 2012. No other spacecraft has ever escaped from orbit around one distant solar system object to travel to and orbit still another extraterrestrial destination. Dawn devoted another 2.5 years to reshaping and tilting its orbit even more so that now it is identical to Ceres'. Once again, that was essential to the intricate celestial choreography in March, when the behemoth reached out with its gravity and tenderly took hold of the spacecraft. They have been performing an elegant pas de deux ever since. Dawn takes great advantage of being able to orbit its two targets by performing extensive measurements that would not be feasible with a fleeting visit at high speed. As its detailed inspection of a strange and distant world continues, we can look forward to more intriguing perspectives and exciting insights into our solar system. On its eighth anniversary of setting sail on the cosmic seas for an extraordinary voyage, the faithful ship is steadily accumulating great treasures. Dawn is 915 miles from Ceres. It is also 2.45 AU from Earth, or 1,025 times as far as the moon and 2.45 times as far as the sun today. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take 41 minutes to make the round trip.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2015/9/dawn-celebrates-eight-years-two-stellar-orbits"}, {"title": "NASA Is Now \"Pretty Sure\" Those Weird White Patches on Ceres Are Salt", "date": "2015-10-06", "content": "For months, NASA scientists have been puzzling over a series of mysterious bright patches spotted in the middle of a huge crater on the dwarf planet Ceres. First seen by the Dawn spacecraft, which is now steadily orbiting closer and closer to Ceres, NASA's original assumption was that the patches were made of ice, but the wavelengths of light being reflected suggested otherwise. And despite coming up with a whole lot of hypotheses since then, they've publicly remained stumped as to what could be causing the patches - until now. At the European Planetary Science Congress in France at the end of last month, Dawn's principal investigator Chris Russell told scientists that they now believe the patches, which are located in the Occator crater, are huge salt deposits. \"We know it's not ice and we're pretty sure it's salt, but we don't know exactly what salt at the present time,\" said Russell in his address, which has since been posted online. Ice was the most obvious guess for the highly reflective patches, because Ceres is believed to harbour a huge ocean beneath its surface. In fact, the dwarf planet is suspected to contain more freshwater than we have here on Earth, and it was thought that a meteor collision may chipped off some of the planet's surface and exposed this frozen water. But ice is known to reflect nearly all of the light shone on it, whereas Ceres' mysterious patches only seem to reflect around 40 percent, so that idea didn't quite add up. There was also the suggestion that the bright spots might be some type of rock, or the results of geyser or volcanic activity. Those sound like pretty cool options, but don't get too disappointed that they've been disproven. If confirmed, the presence of salt on the surface of Ceres is equally exciting, and would indicate that the surface of the dwarf planet is still active. Russell explained that they believe the salts are \"derived from the interior somehow\", and weren't put there by an asteroid. Although we still know very little about the salt patches, it's possible that they may have got there in a similar way to the salty deposits recently confirmed on the surface of Mars. And just like on Mars, there's also a good reason that we're not rushing down to Ceres to check the bright patches out - a subsurface ocean on Ceres could very well harbour life, and we don't want to contaminate it with traces of Earth. As our editor Bec Crew wrote last week, NASA is bound by the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which forbids \"anyone from sending a mission, robot or human, close to a water source in the fear of contaminating it with life from Earth\". And the type of sterilisation required to make rovers safe to get near water would also fry their hardware. \"In order to be completely sterile, they'd have to use really powerful ionising radiation or heat, both of which would damage the electronics,\" astrobiologist Malcolm Walter told Marcus Strom over at The Sydney Morning Herald. \"So they go as far as they dare.\" So for now all our observations of these presumably salty patches will be made by Dawn. But as the spacecraft gets closer to the dwarf planet towards the end of the year, we'll have access to more high-res photos and hopefully more information on what's causing them. If there's one thing we've learnt this year, it's that space has all kinds of weird and wonderful things going on, and we can't wait to find out more about what's going on out there on Ceres.", "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-is-now-pretty-sure-those-weird-white-patches-on-ceres-are-salt"}, {"title": "Largest Object in Asteroid Belt May Have Come From Elsewhere", "date": "2015-11-10", "content": "New and controversial observations from NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which has orbited the dwarf planet Ceres since March, suggest the 4.6-billion-year-old body may have been knocked into the main asteroid belt from the solar system's chillier outskirts. Dawn's discovery of ammoniated clays on the world's surface-reported November 9 at the Division for Planetary Sciences annual meeting-points to this intriguing scenario. Their presence indicates that Ceres was born somewhere beyond the orbit of Neptune, where the sun's weaker glare would not vaporize and scatter the ammonia as the minerals formed. Then, sometime in the following 500 million years, gravitational heave-hos may have thrown the dwarf planet inward, delivering it to the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. There is, of course, another possibility. \"Either Ceres formed farther out altogether and then was implanted in the main belt,\" says Simone Marchi of the Southwest Research Institute, \"or it grew at its current position with the contribution of outer solar system materials.\" The idea of Ceres as an inner solar system transplant isn't a complete surprise. For starters, Ceres doesn't look like any of its neighboring space rocks: It's round, it's the biggest thing in the belt by far, and it is much more watery than anything else nearby. It's more like a warmer version of the icy moons orbiting Jupiter and Saturn. \"Ceres is basically unique, in terms of objects that we've been to,\" says Andy Rivkin of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The Moon is rocky; Pluto is icy. Ceres is the only one you look at with aspects of both, and that makes it a great way to learn about both.\" The dwarf planet's soft, flat-bottomed craters, enigmatic bright spots, a possible ice volcano, and tufts of water vapor hint at a world with something exciting going on beneath the surface. Even more telling, perhaps, is that its density is similar to that of Pluto, which lives in the region beyond Neptune's orbit. \"It sure smells like something that came from the outer solar system,\" Caltech astronomer Mike Brown told National Geographic back in January. Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Researchers have been studying Ceres for a long time, but ground-based telescopes haven't been able to convincingly identify ammonia, since they have had to contend with Earth's obstructive atmosphere. The orbiting Dawn spacecraft has a more ideal perch to observe how molecules on the dwarf planet's surface reflect various wavelengths of light. It was in those wavelengths that Dawn investigator Carle Pieters and her colleagues spied the signature of ammoniated phyllosilicates, which are minerals similar to clays on Earth, mixed in with other materials. Ceres today is much too warm for a volatile molecule like ammonia to survive on its own-it would just drift away as vapor. That means the ammonia must have become bound to those minerals when the mix was somewhere much colder, meaning Ceres either flew in from afar, or was bombarded by ammonia-bearing materials from farther out. Of the two scenarios, Bill McKinnon of Washington University in St. Louis finds Ceres' frigid origin more plausible. \"The idea that pebbles of ammonia would drift in to coat Ceres seems like a kludge,\" he said, noting that everything in the mid- and outer- asteroid belt would also be covered in ammonia, which is not observed. But determining which scenario actually happened will be a tough task for the team. Each history should be associated with a unique distribution of crater sizes and numbers on Ceres, kind of like a fingerprint. In principle, the team only needs to read Ceres' craters to figure out which prediction fits. However, \"the global distribution of craters-and in particular the lack of large craters-is at odds with both scenarios,\" says Marchi. The issues arise because Ceres' outer layer, a viscous mixture that's \"more like icy dirt than dirty ice,\" according to Michael Bland of the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Science Center, is smoothing over craters and erasing them over time. The problem is particularly pronounced with the bigger, older craters, and that will make it a bit tricky to reconstruct Ceres' history. Of course, it's also possible that the detection of ammonia itself is flawed. Some researchers, wary of the result, maintain that Ceres' surface spectra are better explained by brucite, a magnesium-based mineral that readily forms in the asteroid belt. \"I do not understand how they concluded so firmly that it's not brucite,\" says Rivkin, who has challenged earlier claims of ammoniated compounds on Ceres. But it's too soon to say the results are wrong: The complete analysis will be published soon in the journal Nature, and it's possible the results will withstand closer scrutiny. \"It may be that ammoniated phyllosilicates have taken Game Five to go ahead three games to two in a best-of-seven series,\" says Rivkin.

The images were taken between Aug. 17 and Oct. 23, 2015, from an altitude of 915 miles. The region around the south pole appears black in this view because this area has been in shade ever since Dawn's arrival on March 6, 2015, and is therefore not visible. At the north polar region, craters Jarovit, Ghanan and Asari are visible, as well as the mountain Ysolo Mons. Near the south pole, craters Attis and Zadeni can be seen. Detailed maps of the polar regions allow researchers to study the craters in this area and compare them to those covering other parts of Ceres. Variations in shape and complexity can point to different surface compositions. In addition, the bottoms of some craters located close to the poles receive no sunlight throughout Ceres' orbit around the sun. Scientists want to investigate whether surface ice can be found there.

Soaring on a blue-green beam of high- velocity xenon ions, Dawn is making excellent progress as it spirals closer and closer to Ceres, the first dwarf planet discovered. Meanwhile, scientists are progressing and analyzing the tremendous volume of pictures and other data the probe has already sent to Earth. Dawn is flying down to an average altitude of about 240 miles, where it will conduct wide-ranging investigations with its suite of scientific instruments. The spacecraft will be even closer to the rocky, icy ground than the International Space Station is to Earth's surface. The pictures will be four times sharper than the best it has yet taken. The view is going to be fabulous! Dawn will be so near the dwarf planet that its sensors will detect only a small fraction of the vast territory at a time. Mission planners have designed the complex itinerary so that every three weeks, Dawn will fly over most of the terrain while on the sunlit side. Obtaining the planned coverage of the exotic landscapes requires a delicate synchrony between Ceres' and Dawn's movements. Ceres rotates on its axis every nine hours and four minutes. Dawn will revolve around it in a little less than five and a half hours, traveling from the north pole to the south pole over the hemisphere facing the sun and sailing northward over the hemisphere hidden in the darkness of night. Orbital velocity at this altitude is around 610 mph. Last year we had a preview of the plans for this fourth and final mapping orbit, and we will present an updated summary next month. The planned altitude differs from the earlier, tentative value of 230 miles for several reasons. One is that the previous notion for the altitude was based on theoretical models of Ceres' gravity field. Navigators measured the field quite accurately in the previous mapping orbit, and that has allowed them to refine the orbital parameters to choreograph Dawn's celestial pas de deux with Ceres. In addition, prior to Dawn's investigations, Ceres' topography was a complete mystery. Hubble Space Telescope had shown the overall shape well enough to allow scientists to determine that Ceres qualifies as a dwarf planet, but the landforms were indiscernible and the range of relative elevations was simply unknown. Now that Dawn has mapped the topography, we can specify the spacecraft's average height above the ground as it orbits. With continuing analyses of the thousands of stereo pictures taken in August - October and more measurements of the gravity field in the final orbit, we will further refine the average altitude. Finally, we round the altitude numbers to the nearest multiple of five, because, as we will discuss in a subsequent Dawn Journal, the actual orbit will vary in altitude by much more than that.. The variations at Ceres will not be as large, but the principles are the same. To attain its new orbit, Dawn relies on its trusty and uniquely efficient ion engine, which has already allowed the spacecraft to accomplish what no other has even attempted in the 58-year history of space exploration. This is the only mission ever to orbit two extraterrestrial destinations. The spaceship orbited the protoplanet Vesta for 14 months in 2011-2012, revealing myriad fascinating details of the second most massive object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, before its March 2015 arrival in orbit around the most massive. Ion propulsion enables Dawn to undertake a mission that would be impossible without it. While the ion engine provides 10 times the efficiency of conventional spacecraft propulsion, the engine expends the merest whisper of xenon propellant, delivering a remarkably gentle thrust. As a result, Dawn achieves acceleration with patience, and that patience is rewarded with the capability to explore two of the last uncharted worlds in the inner solar system. This raises an obvious question: How cool is that? Fortunately, the answer is equally obvious: Incredibly cool! The efficiency of the ion engine enables Dawn not only to orbit two destinations but also to maneuver extensively around each one, optimizing its orbits to reap the richest possible scientific return at Vesta and Ceres. The gentleness of the ion engine makes the maneuvers gradual and graceful. The spiral descents are an excellent illustration of that. Dawn began its elegant downward coils on Oct. 23 upon concluding more than two months of intensive observations of Ceres from an altitude of 915 miles. At that height, Ceres' gravitational hold was not as firm as it will be in Dawn's lower orbit, so orbital velocity was slower. Circling at 400 mph, it took 19 hours to complete one revolution around Ceres. It will take Dawn more than six weeks to travel from that orbit to its new one. On Nov. 16, at an altitude of about 450 miles, Dawn circled at the same rate that Ceres turned. Now the spacecraft is looping around its home even faster than the world beneath it turns. When ion-thrusting ends on Dec. 7, navigators will measure and analyze the orbital parameters to establish how close they are to the targeted values and whether a final adjustment is needed to fit with the intricate observing strategy. Several phenomena contribute to small differences between the planned orbit and the actual orbit. and here for two of our attempts to elucidate this topic. Engineers have already thoroughly assessed the full range of credible possibilities using sophisticated mathematical methods. This is a complex and challenging process, but the experienced team is well prepared. In case Dawn needs to execute an additional maneuver to bring its orbital motion into closer alignment with the plan, the schedule includes a window for more ion- thrusting on Dec. 11-13. In the parlance of spaceflight, this maneuver to adjust the orbit is a trajectory correction maneuver, and Dawn has experience with them. The operations team takes advantage of every precious moment at Ceres they can, so while they are determining whether to perform the TCM and then developing the final flight plan to implement it, they will ensure the spacecraft continues to work productively. Dawn carries two identical cameras, a primary and a backup. Engineers occasionally operate the backup camera to verify that it remains healthy and ready to be put into service should the primary camera falter. On Dec. 10, the backup will execute a set of tests, and Dawn will transmit the results to Earth on Dec. 11. By then, the work on the TCM will be complete. Although it is likely a TCM will be needed, if it turns out to be unnecessary, mission control has other plans for the spacecraft. In this final orbit, Dawn will resume using its reaction wheels to control its orientation. By electrically changing the speed at which these gyroscope-like devices rotate, the probe can control its orientation, stabilizing itself or turning. We have discussed their lamentable history on Dawn extensively, with two of the four having failed. Although such losses could have been ruinous, the flight team formulated and implemented very clever strategies to complete the mission without the wheels. Exceeding their own expectations in such a serious situation, Dawn is accomplishing even more observations at Ceres than had been planned when it was being built or when it embarked on its ambitious interplanetary journey in 2007. Now the mission lifetime is limited by the small supply of conventional rocket propellant, expelled from reaction control system thrusters strategically located around the spacecraft. When that precious hydrazine is exhausted, the robot will no longer be able to point its solar arrays at the sun, its antenna at Earth, its sensors at Ceres or its ion engines in the direction needed to travel elsewhere, so the mission will conclude. The lower Dawn's orbital altitude, the faster it uses hydrazine, because it must rotate more quickly to keep its sensors pointed at the ground. In addition, it has to fight harder to resist Ceres' relentless gravitational tug on the very large solar arrays, creating an unwanted torque on the ship. Among the innovative solutions to the reaction wheel problems was the development of a new method of orienting the spacecraft with a combination of only two wheels plus hydrazine. In the final orbit, this \" hybrid control \" will use hydrazine at only half the rate that would be needed without the wheels. Therefore, mission controllers have been preserving the units for this final phase of the expedition, devoting the limited remaining usable life to the time that they can provide the greatest benefit in saving hydrazine. Apart from a successful test of hybrid control two years ago and three subsequent periods of a few hours each for biannual operation to redistribute internal lubricants, the two operable wheels have been off since August 2012, when Dawn was climbing away from Vesta on its way out of orbit. Controllers plan to reactivate the wheels on Dec. 14. However, in the unlikely case that the TCM is deemed unnecessary, they will power the wheels on on Dec. 11. The reaction wheels will remain in use for as long as both function correctly. If either one fails, which could happen immediately or might not happen before the hydrazine is depleted next year, it and the other will be powered off, and the mission will continue, relying exclusively on hydrazine control. Dawn will measure the energies and numbers of neutrons and gamma rays emanating from Ceres as soon as it arrives in its new orbit. With a month or so of these measurements, scientists will be able to determine the abundances of some of the elements that compose the material near the surface. Engineers and scientists also will collect new data on the gravity field at this low altitude right away, so they eventually can build up a profile of the dwarf planet's interior structure. The other instruments have narrower fields of view and are more sensitive to small discrepancies in where they are aimed. It will take a few more days to incorporate the actual measured orbital parameters into the corresponding plans that controllers will radio to the spacecraft. Those observations are scheduled to begin on Dec. 18. But always squeezing as much as possible out of the mission, the flight team might actually begin some photography and infrared spectroscopy as early as Dec. 16. Now closing in on its final orbit, the veteran space traveler soon will commence the last phase of its long and fruitful adventure, when it will provide the best views yet of Ceres. Known for more than two centuries as little more than a speck of light in the vast and beautiful expanse of the stars, the spacecraft has already transformed it into a richly detailed and fascinating world. Now Dawn is on the verge of revealing even more of Ceres' secrets, answering more questions and, as is the marvelous nature of science and exploration, raising new ones. Dawn is 295 miles from Ceres. It is also 3.33 AU from Earth, or 1,270 times as far as the moon and 3.37 times as far as the sun today. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take 55 minutes to make the round trip.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2015/11/dawn-begins-descent-to-closest-and-final-orbit-at-ceres"}, {"title": "Nasa's Dawn throws light on giant bright spots on Ceres", "date": "2015-12-09", "content": "When Nasa's Dawn spacecraft reached the largest object in the asteroid belt earlier this year, mission scientists were baffled to find that the alien terrain gleamed with giant bright spots. The glinting patches on the surface of Ceres sparked an intense debate among astronomers who could not work out if the shiny material was frozen water, reflective salt deposits, or even geysers blasting water vapour into space. Now, fresh images sent back from the Dawn probe have shed light on the mystery of the spots and the formation of the 950km-wide asteroid, which doubles as the nearest dwarf planet to Earth. Andreas Nathues, a lead scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, used an instrument called the framing camera on the Dawn spacecraft to make detailed observations of Ceres through different coloured filters. While most of the surface is dark as asphalt, the images show that the body sparkles with more than 130 bright spots which vary in brightness from that of concrete to sea ice. Most of the shiny patches are found at the bottom of impact craters that pock the surface of the dwarf planet. A spectral analysis of the patches revealed that they most closely match the appearance of hydrated magnesium sulphate, though the scientists cannot rule out the presence of other compounds, according to a report in the journal Nature. The brightest spot on Ceres lies in the Occator crater, a 90km-wide, 4km-deep dent, in the surface of the dwarf planet. To check whether the feature might be sending up plumes of water vapour, the scientists observed the crater from a shallow angle. They found no evidence of plumes, but did see a haze above the bright spot, most likely water vapour emanating from ice beneath the surface that heated up in the sun. The findings suggest that Ceres has a dark insulating layer, beneath which there is water in the form of ice, or as water molecules bound up in hydrated salts. \"Our results are consistent with widely distributed subsurface water or ice and water activity in the main asteroid belt,\" the scientists write. The Dawn spacecraft launched in 2007 and made observations of an asteroid called Vesta in 2012 before reaching Ceres in March 2015, eight years after blast off. Ceres lies three times farther from the sun than Earth does, which is close enough for water beneath the surface to melt and refreeze. A second study in Nature from a separate team at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome reports that Ceres most probably formed in the outer solar system. Maria Cristina De Sanctis used the visible-infrared mapping spectrometer on the Dawn spacecraft to examine minerals on the surface of Ceres. They found evidence that minerals called ammoniated phyllosilicates are widespread on the asteroid, suggesting the ammonia was incorporated into Ceres when it formed. Since ammonia ice is only stable in the frigid reaches of the outer solar system, De Sanctis argues that Ceres either formed far away from the fledgling sun, or that pebbled-sized lumps from that region of space spiralled into the asteroid belt. Monica Grady, a professor of planetary sciences at the Open University, said there was intense speculation about the nature of the bright spots on Ceres. \"There is certainly water there but more likely water-bearing minerals rather than blocks of ice. But just the fact that you've got specific patches of salt is really interesting,\" she said. \"We have seen signs before of localised water vapour that die away in the night when it gets cold. But a centimetre below the surface, that heat is retained for a few more hours. You can get some quite active chemistry in there,\" she added.

Even more puzzling, the bright spots lie in all kinds of terrain and appear variously as flat patches on the floors of craters and as an isolated peak, in at least one case. According to Arizona State University's Marc Neveu and Steve Desch, what's emplacing the white material on the surface is what's happening far below. They recently published their model in Geophysical Research Letters to explain what's likely going on. Ceres orbits the Sun in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, at nearly three times Earth's distance from the Sun. Discovered in 1801 and the largest object in the main belt, Ceres is nearly 600 miles wide. Even before Dawn, scientists knew something was up with Ceres. Earth-based observations and data from orbiting space telescopes had shown it has a surface with water-altered minerals and perhaps a tenuous cloud of water vapor around it. Dawn's data added to the puzzle. The spots have a brightness that points to ice or salts, and as noted above, they appear as both flat and raised structures in many different types of landscape. \"That was a clue for us,\" said Neveu of ASU's School of Earth and Space Exploration, where he is a postdoctoral researcher working with Desch, a professor of astrophysics in the school. \"Previously published models suggested that Ceres had subsurface liquid water in the past and possibly until today. We also knew that cryovolcanism on Ceres was definitely an option because a present-day underground ocean would be refreezing and pressurizing liquid water down deep.\" Cryovolcanism, or cold volcanism, is partly similar to the ordinary volcanism that occurs on Earth and other rocky planets. The difference is that in the cryo case, what erupts instead of molten rock is molten ice - liquid water or brine. Water ice would quickly sublimate into the vacuum of space at Ceres' surface, leaving behind salt deposits. Neveu said the pre-Dawn reports of water vapor were tantalizing clues of surface water or young ice. \"When images released by the Dawn team revealed those bright spots, we immediately thought of a cryovolcanic origin,\" Neveu said. Four billion years ago, Ceres formed from a mixture of dust, rocky grains and ices. Today, it has a rocky core under a mantle of ice and rocky fragments. Between the two lie pockets of cold, briny liquid, the source of the white spots on the surface of Ceres. Artwork by Neveu and Desch Neveu and Desch began with a reasonable assumption that Ceres formed from a mixture of ice and micro-particles of rock and dust. They hypothesized that the rocky particles released heat by radioactive decay. Impacts by meteorites were another likely factor. The heat would melt ice while allowing the denser rock fraction to settle toward the center of Ceres. It would also leave a surface coated with a residue of water-altered minerals. Said Desch, \"Our calculations of Ceres' evolution show that it is just warm enough deep inside Ceres for liquid water to exist.\" This water, he said, probably has other substances mixed in, making it a brine like seawater. \"We calculate a temperature of 240 to 250 Kelvins, or about -27 degrees to -9 degrees Fahrenheit, just warm enough for chloride brines to persist and to be freezing today.\" As the brine freezes, Neveu and Desch explained, it will expand and thus raise the pressure on any liquid or briny reservoirs inside Ceres. \"This should drive these fluids up to the surface, where they will erupt as cryovolcanic outflows,\" according to Neveu. If cryovolcanism at various places across Ceres' surface is driven by liquid freezing at depth, this activity may have increased as Ceres has cooled down, making it more likely today. Cryovolcanism also has a side effect, said Desch: \"The eruptions and outflows may contribute to the water vapor being produced at Ceres.\" Added Neveu: \"Cryovolcanism coming from deep inside Ceres is breathing new activity onto its ancient surface.\" ", "url": "https://news.asu.edu/20151215-deep-freeze-puts-squeeze-dwarf-planet-ceres"}, {"title": "Dawn's Lowest Orbit: Near South Pole", "date": "2015-12-22", "content": "This view of Ceres, taken by NASA's Dawn spacecraft on December 10, shows an area in southern hemisphere of the dwarf planet.

Ceres before Dawn Named for the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain, Ceres was the first dwarf planet discovered, in 1801. That's 129 years before Pluto - and in fact, both were originally considered planets, only later to be designated dwarf planets. Although Ceres appeared as little more than a fuzzy blob of light amidst the stars, scientists determined that it's the behemoth of the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter - nearly 600 miles in diameter. Its surface area is more than a third of the area of the continental US. Before Dawn's arrival, Ceres was the largest object between the sun and Pluto that a spacecraft had not visited. Since well before Dawn, we've had telescopic evidence that Ceres harbors water. While it's mostly in the form of ice, scientists have good reason to believe an underground ocean once circulated. The question of whether reservoirs still lurk beneath the alien surface remains open. Dawn's studies of Ceres may even provide hints about how Earth acquired its own supply of that precious liquid billions of years ago. In 2007, we launched Dawn from Cape Canaveral, and it will never again visit its erstwhile planetary home. In 2011, it became the only spacecraft ever to orbit an object in the main asteroid belt, devoting 14 months to scrutinizing protoplanet Vesta. Dawn showed us this second most massive resident of the belt is more closely related to the terrestrial planets than to the much smaller chunks of rock that are typical of asteroids. The unique capability to travel to worlds beyond Mars, enter orbit and maneuver extensively and then depart for yet another destination is achieved with advanced ion propulsion. The technology spent much of its history in the domain of sci-fi, including Star Trek and Star Wars. But what may have seemed only science fiction is science fact. Without its three ion engines, Dawn's mission wouldn't be possible. A gridded ion thruster uses electrical energy to create, accelerate and neutralize positively charged ions to generate thrust. The ion engines use xenon gas, a chemical cousin of helium and neon. With electrical power from Dawn's large solar panels, the xenon is given an electrical charge in a process called ionization. The engines use high voltage to accelerate the ions. They're then shot out of the engines at up to 90,000 mph. When the ions leave the spacecraft at this fantastically high speed, it's pushed in the opposite direction. Dawn's ion propulsion system is exceptionally efficient - 10 times as efficient as conventional spacecraft propulsion. It's comparable to your car getting 250 miles per gallon. Dawn drops into Cerean orbit Finally, after a journey of more than seven years and three billion miles, our interplanetary ambassador reached Ceres on March 6 2015, and gracefully entered the dwarf planet's permanent gravitational embrace. Mission controllers at JPL then piloted the craft to three orbits at successively lower altitudes, so we could first obtain an overview and then gain better and better views of this vast unexplored territory. And Dawn has just performed the penultimate act in its grand celestial choreography. It's spent the last seven weeks maneuvering to its lowest altitude. Orbiting now about 240 miles above the exotic terrain of rock and ice, Dawn is closer to Ceres than the International Space Station is to Earth. Dawn brings Ceres into focus Included in the spacecraft's suite of sophisticated sensors is a camera that has already taken 10,000 pictures of alien landscapes on Ceres. Following from Ceres' own name, features Dawn discovers are named for agricultural deities and festivals from around the world. We see rugged terrain and smooth areas, sometimes with streaks of material that's flowed across it. There are craters large and small, created by billions of years of assaults in the rough-and-tumble neighborhood of the asteroid belt. We see mountains and valleys, huge fissures in the ground and bright spots that glow with a mysterious luster, reflecting much more sunlight than most of the dark surface. The most striking of these shining regions, inside the 55-mile-wide Occator Crater, is so bright that the Hubble Space Telescope detected a hint of it a decade ago. Dawn's pictures to date have been more than 200 times sharper than Hubble's. The images we're starting to get back now will be even better, revealing 850 times the detail that Hubble had provided. Dawn has shown us a mountain named Ahuna Mons that towers more than 20,000 feet in an otherwise unremarkable area, comparable to the elevation of North America's tallest peak, Mt Denali. Bright streaks seem to suggest some unidentified material once flowed down the steep slopes of Ahuna Mons. While scientists have not yet determined what forces and processes shaped this conical mountain, it doesn't take a geologist to notice its resemblance to terrestrial volcanic cones. Imagine what it might have been like to witness an eruption of some strange combination of water and other chemicals on this cold, distant world. Beyond photos, Dawn will take a great many other measurements from its new orbital perch before its mission concludes in 2016. It will measure radiation to help scientists determine what types of atoms are present on Ceres. It will use infrared light to identify the minerals on Ceres' surface. And it will gauge subtle variations in the gravitational field to reveal the interior structure of the dwarf planet. Once the spacecraft exhausts the small supply of conventional rocket propellant it squirts through thrusters to control its orientation in the zero-gravity, frictionless conditions of spaceflight, it will no longer be able to point its solar arrays at the sun, its antenna at Earth, its sensors at Ceres or its ion engines in the direction needed to travel elsewhere. But the ship will remain in orbit around Ceres as surely as the moon remains in orbit around Earth and Earth remains in orbit around the sun. Its legacy in the history of our efforts to reach out from our humble home to touch the stars is secure. Dawn will become an inert celestial monument to humankind's creativity, ingenuity, and passion for exploring the cosmos. This part of Ceres, near the south pole, has such long shadows because, from the perspective of this location, the sun is near the horizon. At the time When Dawn took this image on December 10, the sun was 4 degrees north of the equator. If you were standing this close to Ceres' south pole, the sun would never get high in the sky during the course of a nine-hour Cerean day.

The new images showcase details of the cratered and fractured surface. A 3-D version of one of the images is shown below. Dawn took these images of the southern hemisphere of Ceres on 10 December, at an approximate altitude of 240 miles, which is its lowest- ever orbital altitude. Dawn will remain at this altitude for the rest of its mission, and indefinitely afterward. The resolution of the new images is about 120 feet per pixel. Among the striking views is a chain of craters called Gerber Catena, located just west of the large crater Urvara. Troughs are common on larger planetary bodies, caused by contraction, impact stresses and the loading of the crust by large mountains - Olympus Mons on Mars is one example. The fracturing found all across Ceres' surface indicates that similar processes may have occurred there, despite its smaller size. Many of the troughs and grooves on Ceres were likely formed as a result of impacts, but some appear to be tectonic, reflecting internal stresses that broke the crust. \"Why they are so prominent is not yet understood, but they are probably related to the complex crustal structure of Ceres,\" said Paul Schenk, a Dawn science team member at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston. The images were taken as part of a test of Dawn's backup framing camera. The primary framing camera, which is essentially identical, began its imaging campaign at this lowest orbit on 16 December. Both cameras are healthy. Dawn's other instruments also began their intense period of observations this month. The visible and infrared mapping spectrometer will help identify minerals by looking at how various wavelengths of light are reflected by the surface of Ceres. The gamma ray and neutron detector is also active. By measuring the energies and numbers of gamma rays and neutrons, two components of nuclear radiation, it will help scientists determine the abundances of some elements on Ceres. Earlier in December, Dawn science team members revealed that the bright material found in such notable craters as Occator is consistent with salt - and proposed that a type of magnesium sulfate called hexahydrite may be present. A different group of Dawn scientists found that Ceres also contains ammoniated clays. Because ammonia is abundant in the outer solar system, this finding suggests that Ceres could have formed in the vicinity of Neptune and migrated inward, or formed in place with material that migrated in from the outer solar system. \"As we take the highest-resolution data ever from Ceres, we will continue to examine our hypotheses and uncover even more surprises about this mysterious world,\" said Chris Russell, principal investigator of the Dawn mission, based at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dawn is the first mission to visit a dwarf planet, and the first mission outside the Earth-Moon system to orbit two distinct solar system targets. It orbited protoplanet Vesta for 14 months in 2011 and 2012, and arrived at Ceres on 6 March 2015.

As Dawn approached Ceres, which is the largest body in the Asteroid Belt, and began snapping low-resolution images, it quickly became noticeable that one spot on the surface of Ceres was far brighter than all its surroundings. Even after Dawn entered orbit on 6 March 2015 and spiralled closer and closer over the course of the year, answers remained few and far between. The bright spot was revealed to be several groups of bright patches spread between several craters, the largest concentration being found within the 90-kilometre-wide crater Occator. Contrary to an earlier hypothesis, the bright spots are not quite reflective enough to be water-ice, so scientists' thoughts have turned to salt deposits as a possible explanation, although if it is salt, then how it ended up on the surface remains a mystery that is going to rumble on into 2016.", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2016/01/02/no-6-our-first-up-close-look-at-ceres/"}, {"title": "Soar over dwarf planet Ceres' surface in revealing NASA video", "date": "2016-01-29", "content": "While the dwarf planet Ceres is now known for its mysterious \"bright spots,\" which scientists now think are caused by a type of salt, it has a lot of other fascinating features, which you can see in a new NASA video. From August through October 2015, NASA's Dawn spacecraft circled Ceres, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and imaged its surface using its onboard high- resolution camera. Ceres has an equatorial diameter of 1,859 miles, and Dawn circled at an altitude of 900 miles during that time. Now NASA has stitched some of those images together to create a video animation that simulates a flight over Ceres. The video was released Friday. \"The simulated overflight shows the wide range of crater shapes that we have encountered on Ceres. The viewer can observe the sheer walls of the crater Occator, and also Dantu and Yalode, where the craters are a lot flatter,\" Dawn mission scientist Ralf Jaumann said in a statement. Occator, the crater where the flyover begins, is where those mysterious bright spots are situated. It's followed by six other geologic features named after \"earthly agricultural spirits, deities and festivals,\" according to NASA, such as Urvara, Haulani and Ikapati. Thanks to CGI effects, we're no strangers today to zooming around planets in sci-fi films. But it's pretty awe-inspiring to look at the surface of an actual object in our solar system -- located about about 257 million miles away -- not a Hollywood creation, although there was some color-enhancing done to bring out the features of the surface. \"Scientists believe areas with shades of blue contain younger, fresher material, including flows, pits and cracks,\" NASA explained. Dawn is still circling and imaging Ceres and is now just 240 miles above its surface, so hopefully we'll get even better tours around the battered space rock in the coming months. This one is already an improvement over a similar animation released in June 2015.

In its final orbit, where it will remain even beyond the end of its mission, at its lowest altitude, Dawn is circling dwarf planet Ceres, gathering an album of spellbinding pictures and other data to reveal the nature of this mysterious world of rock and ice. Ceres turns on its axis in a little more than nine hours. Meanwhile, its new permanent companion, a robotic emissary from Earth, revolves in a polar orbit, completing a loop in slightly under 5.5 hours. It flies from the north pole to the south over the side of Ceres facing the sun. Then when it heads north, the ground beneath it is cloaked in the deep dark of night on a world without a moon. As we discussed last month, Dawn's primary measurements do not depend on illumination. It can sense the nuclear radiation and the gravity field regardless of the lighting. This month, let's take a look at the other measurements our explorer is performing, most of which do depend on sunlight. Of course the photographs do. Dawn had already mapped Ceres quite thoroughly from higher altitudes. The spacecraft acquired an extensive set of stereo and color pictures in its third mapping orbit. But now that Dawn is only about 240 miles high, its images are four times as sharp, revealing new details of the strange and beautiful landscapes. Our spaceship is closer to Ceres than the International Space Station is to Earth. At that short range, it takes a long time to capture all of the vast territory, because each picture covers a relatively small area. Dawn's camera sees a square about 23 miles on a side, less than one twentieth of one percent of the more than one million square miles. In an ideal world, it would take just over two thousand photos from this altitude to see all the sights. However, as we will discuss in more detail next month, it is not possible to control the orbital motion and the pointing of the camera accurately enough to manage without more photos than that. Most of the time, Dawn is programmed to turn at just the right rate to keep looking at the ground beneath it as it travels, synchronizing its rotation with its revolution around Ceres. It photographs the passing scenery, storing the pictures for later transmission to Earth. But some of the time, it cannot take pictures, because to send its bounty of data, it needs to point its main antenna at that distant planet, home not only to its controllers but also to many others who share in the thrill of a bold cosmic adventure. Dawn spends about three and a half days with its camera and other sensors pointed at Ceres. Then it radios its findings home for a little more than one day. During these communications sessions, even when it soars over lit terrain, it does not observe the sights below. Mission planners have devised an intricate plan that should allow nearly complete coverage in about six weeks. To accomplish this, they guided Dawn to a carefully chosen orbit, and it has been doing an exceptionally good job there executing its complex activities. Last month, we marveled at a stunning view that was not the typical perspective of peering straight down from orbit. Sometimes controllers now program Dawn to take a few more pictures after it stops aiming its instruments down, while it starts to turn to aim its antenna to Earth. This clever idea provides bonus views of whatever happens to be in the camera's sights as it slowly rotates from the point beneath the spacecraft off to the horizon. Who doesn't feel the attraction of the horizon and long to know what lies beyond? Another of Dawn's scientific devices is two different sensors combined into one instrument. Like the camera, the visible and infrared mapping spectrometers look at the sunlight reflected from the ground. A spectrometer breaks up light into its constituent colors, just as a prism or a droplet of water does when revealing, quite literally, all the colors of the rainbow. Dawn's visible spectrometer would have a view very much like that. The infrared spectrometer, of course, looks at wavelengths of light our limited eyes cannot see, just as there are wavelengths of sound our limited ears cannot hear. A spectrometer does more than simply disperse the light into its components, however. It measures the intensity of that light at the different wavelengths. The materials on the surface leave their signature in the sunlight they reflect, making some wavelengths relatively brighter and some dimmer. That characteristic pattern is called a spectrum. By comparing these spectra with spectra measured in laboratories, scientists can infer the nature of the minerals on the ground. We described some of the intriguing conclusions last month. VIR does still more. Rather than record the visible spectrum and the infrared spectrum from a single region, it takes spectra at 256 adjacent locations simultaneously. This would be like taking one column of 256 pixels in a picture and having a separate spectrum for each. By stitching columns together, you could construct the two dimensional picture but with the added dimension of an extensive spectrum at every location. This capability to build up an image with spectra everywhere is what makes it a mapping spectrometer. VIR produces a remarkably rich view of its targets! VIR's spectra contain much finer measurements of the colors and a wider range of wavelengths than the camera's images. In exchange, the camera has sharper vision and so can discern smaller geological features. In more technical terms, VIR achieves better spectral resolution and the camera achieves better spatial resolution. Fortunately, it is not a competition, because Dawn has both, and the instruments yield complementary measurements. VIR generates a very large volume of data in each snapshot. As a result, Dawn can only capture and store relatively small areas of the dwarf planet with the mapping spectrometers, especially at this low altitude. Scientists have recognized from the first design of the mission that it would not be possible to cover all of Ceres with VIR from the closer orbits. Nevertheless, Dawn has far exceeded expectations, returning a great many more spectra than anticipated. Still, as long as the spacecraft operates in this final mapping orbit, there will continue to be interesting targets to study with VIR. Based on the nearly 20 million spectra of Ceres that VIR acquired from higher altitudes, the team has determined that new infrared spectra will provide more insight into the dwarf planet's character than the visible spectra. Because of their composition, the minerals display more salient signatures in infrared wavelengths than visible. The excellent visible spectra from the first three mapping orbits are deemed more than sufficient. Therefore, to make the best use of our faithful probe and to dedicate the resources to what is most likely to yield new knowledge about Ceres, VIR is devoting its share of the mission data in this final orbit to its infrared mapping spectrometer. We have many more exciting discoveries to look forward to! The infrared light Ceres reflects from the sun can tell scientists a great deal about the composition, but they can learn even more from analyzing VIR's measurements. The sun isn't the only source of infrared. Ceres itself is. Many people correctly associate infrared with heat, because warm objects emit infrared light, and the strength at different wavelengths depends on the temperature. That calls for measuring the spectrum! Distant from the sun though it is, Ceres is warmed slightly by the brilliant star, so it has a very faint infrared glow of its own. Scientists can distinguish in VIR's observations between the reflected infrared sunlight and the infrared light Ceres radiates. In essence, VIR can function as a remote thermometer. Last month, in one of Dawn's best photos yet of Ceres, we considered planning a hike across a breathtaking landscape. In case we do, VIR has shown we should be prepared for chilly conditions. Observed temperatures during the day on the dwarf planet range from -135 degrees Fahrenheit to -30 degrees Fahrenheit. This finding provides compelling support for this writer's frequent claim that Ceres is really cool. In addition, knowing the temperatures will be very important for understanding geological processes on this icy, rocky world, just as we know the movement of terrestrial glaciers depends on temperature. Your loyal correspondent can't -- or, at least, won't -- help but indulge his nerdiness with a brief tangent. The range of temperatures above represent the warmest on Ceres, given that VIR cannot measure lower values. It's amusing, if you have a similar weird sense of humor, that Ceres' average temperature apparently is not that far from what it would be for a black hole of the same mass. We won't delve into the physics here, but such a black hole would be -225 degrees Fahrenheit. OK, enough hilarity. Back to Dawn and Ceres... Ever creative, scientists are attempting another clever method to gain insight into the nature of this exotic orb. When Dawn is at just the right position in its orbit on the far side of Ceres, so that a straight line to Earth passes very close to the limb of Ceres itself, the spacecraft's radio signal will actually hit the dwarf planet. The radio waves interact with the materials on the surface, which can induce an exquisitely subtle distortion. After bouncing off the ground at a grazing angle, the radio signal continues on its way, heading toward Earth. The effect on the signal is much too small to affect the normal communications at all, but specialized equipment at NASA's Deep Space Network designed for this purpose might still be able to detect the tiny changes. The fantastically sensitive antennas measure the properties of the radio waves, and by studying the details, scientists may be able to learn more about the properties of the surface of the distant world. For example, this could help them distinguish between different types of materials as well as reveal how rough or smooth the ground is at scales far, far smaller than the camera can discern. This is an extremely challenging measurement, and no small distortions have been detected so far, but always making the best possible use of the resources, scientists continue to look for them. In addition to those bonus measurements, Dawn remains very productive in acquiring infrared spectra, photographs, gamma ray spectra and neutron spectra plus conducting measurements of the massive body's gravitational field, all of which contribute to unlocking the mysteries of the first dwarf planet ever discovered or explored. The venerable adventurer is in good condition and is operating flawlessly. We have discussed extensively the failures of two of the four reaction wheels, devices Dawn used to depend on to control its orientation in space. Without three healthy reaction wheels, the probe has had to rely instead on hydrazine propellant expelled from the small jets of the reaction control system ., that remarkable system does double duty, reducing the need for the hydrazine. For most of the time since escaping from Vesta's gravitational clutches in 2012, Dawn has kept the other two reaction wheels in reserve so any remaining lifetime from those devices could offset the high cost of hydrazine propellant to turn and point in this current tight orbit. Those two wheels have been on and functioning flawlessly since Dec. 14, 2015, and every day they operate, they keep the expenditure of the dwindling supply of hydrazine to half of what it would be without them. But the ever-diligent team recognizes another wheel could falter at any moment, and they remain ready to continue the mission with pure hydrazine control after only a short recovery operation. If a third failure is at all like the two that have occurred already, the hapless wheel won't give an indication of a problem until it's too late. A reaction wheel failure evidently is entirely unpredictable. We'll know about it only after it occurs in the remote depths of space where Dawn resides at an alien world. Earth and Ceres are so far from each other that their motions are essentially independent. The planet and the dwarf planet follow their own separate repetitive paths around the sun. And each carries its own retinue: Earth has thousands of artificial satellites and one prominent natural one, the moon. Ceres has one known satellite. It arrived there in March 2015, and its name is Dawn. Coincidentally, both reached extremes earlier this month in their elliptical heliocentric orbits. Earth, in its annual journey around our star, was at perihelion, or the closest point to the sun, on Jan. 2, when it was 0.98 AU away. Ceres, which takes 4.6 years for each loop, attained its aphelion, or greatest distance from the sun, on Jan. 6. On that day, it was 2.98 AU from the gravitational master of the solar system. Far, far from the planet where its deep-space voyage began, Dawn is now bound to Ceres, held in a firm but gentle gravitational embrace. The spacecraft continues to unveil new and fascinating secrets there for the benefit of all those who remain with Earth but who still look to the sky with wonder, who feel the lure of the unknown, who are thrilled by new knowledge, and who yearn to know the cosmos. Dawn is 240 miles from Ceres. It is also 3.87 AU from Earth, or 1,440 times as far as the moon and 3.93 times as far as the sun today. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take one hour and four minutes to make the round trip.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2016/1/dawns-sunny-side-views-of-dwarf-planet-ceres"}, {"title": "Dwarf Planet Ceres Still Stuns, 215 Years After Discovery", "date": "2016-02-08", "content": "The dwarf planet Ceres was first glimpsed through a telescope 215 years ago, and as researchers learn more than ever, they continue to be amazed by the object. NASA's Dawn mission arrived at the dwarf planet last year and saw odd features that observers are still trying to figure out: more than 130 reflective areas are likely made up of salt, and the small body also hosts a rather large, cone-shaped mountain. \"When Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered Ceres, exploring it was beyond imagination,\" Marc Rayman, mission director and chief engineer for Dawn at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a statement. \"More than two centuries later, NASA dispatched a machine on a cosmic journey of more than 3 billion miles to reach the distant, mysterious world he glimpsed.\" But back when Ceres was discovered, Piazzi didn't quite understand what he was looking at. After his first observation on Jan. 1, 1801, he noticed that the object had changed position slightly on his next observing night. His first suspicion was that it was a comet, but he also had evidence that the object might be something else. \"I have presented this star as a comet, but owing to its lack of nebulosity, and to its motion being so slow and rather uniform, I feel in the heart that it could be something better than a comet, perhaps,\" Piazzi wrote to fellow astronomer Barnaba Oriani. Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered Ceres on Jan. 1, 1801, using this instrument, called a Ramsden Circle. The telescope is on display at the Palermo Observatory in Sicily. Piazzi also wrote to astronomer Johann Elert Bode, who devised a mathematical formula that he said would predict the locations of planets in the solar system relative to the sun. There was an undiscovered planet, the formula said, between Mars and Jupiter. For this reason, Ceres caught Bode's attention. Bode had already marshaled a group of astronomers to search for an object in that region, and he was determined to uncover more information. Piazzi spoke to the press about his finding, but he did not give his data to other astronomers. This made things difficult when he fell ill and was unable to continue his observations. In February of that year, Paris-based astronomer J\u00e9r\u00f4me de Lalande asked for some data from Piazzi, who provided it in April, after he had recovered. One of Lalande's students, Johann Karl Burckhardt, then calculated that the orbit of Ceres appeared to be circular, unlike a comet's. But by the spring of 1801, no one had been able to see the new object besides Piazzi, because the skies had been cloudy. Also, by that time, Ceres was so close to the sun, from Earth's perspective, that it couldn't be seen at night. There was a real risk of losing it in the skies forever. After immense pressure from other astronomers to make his observations public, Piazzi published the data in July. Ceres was finally spotted again in December 1801 by astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach, using projections from mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Astronomers still debated about the status of Ceres - comet, planet or something else - until other objects like it were discovered between Mars and Jupiter. These findings included Pallas, Juno and Vesta. Astronomer William Herschel suggested that these smaller objects be called \"asteroids,\" because they appear starlike in telescopes. Today we have found hundreds of thousands of asteroids in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 along with Pluto, due to its size and circular shape. Researchers have viewed it with the Hubble Space Telescope and up close with NASA's Dawn mission, which is orbiting the dwarf planet. Dawn is currently in its lowest orbit ever, just 240 miles from Ceres' surface, where it will reveal even more about the mysterious dwarf planet.

The craft's anniversary follows its investigations at the protoplanet Vesta in the asteroid belt and an ongoing series of discoveries regarding Ceres, the closest dwarf planet to Earth. Dawn - first spacecraft to orbit two celestial bodies: Launched aboard a Delta II rocket on 27 September 2007 at sunrise, NASA's Dawn spacecraft was hurtled from Earth toward the asteroid belt on an extremely unique mission for not just the U.S. space agency but for spaceflight in general. Specifically, Dawn was built to be the first spacecraft to investigate two different celestial bodies in the asteroid belt and become the first spacecraft ever to enter orbit of two gravitationally different bodies. This unique ability was possible because of an ion propulsion drive that has powered Dawn and allowed for the velocity changes needed to enter orbit of one body, leave orbit of that body, travel the vast distances of the asteroid belt, and then enter orbit of another. Moreover, just over one year prior to the mission's launch, the International Astronomical Union officially designated Ceres as one of the known dwarf planets in the solar system at the time. With the anticipated mission timelines of Dawn and New Horizons, it was quickly realized that, should all go according to plan, Dawn would become the first human object to investigate a dwarf planet at close proximity and, regardless, would become the first spacecraft to perform long duration, in- situ operations around a dwarf planet. After a near four year journey, Dawn entered orbit of its first target - Vesta - on 16 July 2011. After over one year of orbital operations at Vesta, Dawn fired its ion engine on 5 September 2012 to begin its historic journey toward Ceres. Dawn arrives at Ceres: After a just over two years of cruise operations, Dawn began unofficial proximity operations with Ceres on 1 December 2014 with the imaging of the dwarf planet's extended disc. On 12 and 19 February, two full rotation observation photographic sessions took place as part of the long-range global mapping campaign for Ceres. During this campaign, mission scientists were greeted with their first of several unexpected surprises at Ceres - the appearance of a white glimmering area on the surface, which was initially thought to indicate the potential presence of a liquid or other highly reflective material on the dwarf planet's surface. Then, at 5:36 a.m. PST on 6 March 2015, mission controllers, who were not in communication with Dawn due to its orientation needs for the orbital insertion burn at Ceres, received the signal from the spacecraft that Dawn was healthy and had entered orbit as planned. With the signal, Dawn became the first spacecraft to enter orbit of a second gravitationally different body and historically became the first spacecraft to perform proximity operations with and observations of a dwarf planet, entering orbit of Ceres four months prior to the New Horizons probe's flyby of Pluto. Speaking one year ago, Chris Russell, principal investigator of the Dawn mission at the University of California, Los Angeles said \"We feel exhilarated. We have much to do over the next year and a half, but we are now on station with ample reserves, and a robust plan to obtain our science objectives.\" One year at Ceres: After being captured into Ceres' gravity, Dawn continued to fire its ion engine to reduce its orbital altitude and circularize its orbit to one of 13,500 kilometers above the surface of the dwarf planet. This operation was completed on 23 April, at which point Dawn entered its first science orbit and began its intensive primary science campaign at Ceres. By 13 April, scientists and investigators with Dawn had completed a color map of Ceres' surface, revealing differences in morphology and colors across the dwarf planet's surface that indicated that Ceres was once a geologically active body. In addition to the color map, Dawn's onboard cameras also revealed that the dwarf planet was far less cratered than expected, also lending evidence to the hypothesis that Ceres was once active. \"This dwarf planet was not just an inert rock throughout its history. It was active, with processes that resulted in different materials in different regions. We are beginning to capture that diversity in our color images,\" said Mr. Russell. Moreover, this color map revealed that the two bright spots captured by Dawn's cameras during its approach to Ceres were located in cooler regions of the dwarf planet. On 23 April, Dawn arrived at its 13,500 km circular orbit and began its first primary science phase - a 15-day, one orbit mapping mission around Ceres. During this mapping phase, on 3 and 4 May, the spacecraft was able to image the two bright reflective spots in the Northern Hemisphere crater of the dwarf planet. From this altitude, Dawn's cameras were able to clearly discern that the two bright regions were composed of smaller bright and highly reflective objects, though their exact nature remained elusive. By 8 May, Dawn completed its first science phase and, on 9 May, began firing its ion engine to perform a month-long orbital descent to its second primary mapping orbit just 4,400 km above the surface of Ceres. This maneuver was completed on 3 June, brought Dawn three times closer to the surface of Ceres then its previous orbit, took the craft's orbital period from 15 days to 3 days, and marked the commencement of the second primary science phase of the mission. After arriving in this new orbit, one of the first features Dawn's cameras were able to capture were the two bright spots that had captivated scientists and the general public for months. Under the new set of images, the region of bright spots was revealed to be about 90 km across, with each spot consisting of numerous individual bright points of different sizes. But again, no obvious explanation for these bright spots was understood from the new images returned by Dawn. \"The bright spots in this configuration make Ceres unique from anything we've seen before in the solar system,\" said Mr. Russell \"The science team is working to understand their source. Reflection from ice is the leading candidate in my mind, but the team continues to consider alternate possibilities, such as salt. \"With closer views from the new orbit and multiple view angles, we soon will be better able to determine the nature of this enigmatic phenomenon.\" This determination is possible with Dawn's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer, which can identify specific minerals present on Ceres by looking at how light is reflected as each mineral reflects the range of visible and infrared-light wavelengths in a unique way. In addition to the two bright spots, the first views of Ceres from this new orbit indicated that activity on the surface of the dwarf planet included flows, landslides, and various collapsed structures. \"The surface of Ceres has revealed many interesting and unique features,\" said Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator for the Dawn mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"For example, icy moons in the outer solar system have craters with central pits, but on Ceres, central pits in large craters are much more common. These and other features will allow us to understand the inner structure of Ceres that we cannot sense directly.\" Likewise, Paul Schenk, a geologist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute and member of the Dawn science team, stated that \"The craters we find on Ceres, in terms of their depth and diameter, are very similar to what we see on Dione and Tethys, two icy satellites of Saturn that are about the same size and density as Ceres. \"The features are pretty consistent with an ice-rich crust.\" After completing its second primary science phase, Dawn fired its ion engine on 30 June to begin a multi-week maneuver to lower its orbit even closer to Ceres' surface. However, shortly after this procedure began, protective software inside the spacecraft detected an anomaly and shut down the engine and placed the vehicle in safe mode. Across the first two days of July, engineers made configuration changes to Dawn and returned the spacecraft to normal operations. It was immediately decided that Dawn would remain in its present orbit until engineers could determine precisely what happened and update the craft's flight plan. It was later discovered that the cause of the safe mode was a mechanical gimbal system, used to control the spacecraft's orientation during ion thrusting, for ion engine #3. However, since Dawn only uses one of its three ion engines at a time, the teams switched to ion engine #2, mounted to a different gimbal, and conducted a series of tests on the 14th and 16th of July. These tests confirmed that Dawn was ready to perform its orbit lowering maneuver to its third science phase orbit, which began on 17 July. This five-week burn lowered the spacecraft's altitude to just 1,450 km - known as the High-Altitude Mapping Orbit. Dawn reached its third science phase orbit in August and began a part of its mission which involved capturing full surface images of Ceres over the course of 11 days and 14 orbits. The 11-day, 14-orbit cycle was repeated consistently over two months and allowed Dawn to compile six complete surface maps of the dwarf planet at a resolution of 140 m per pixel. In addition to surface mapping operations, a second high priority aspect of the HAMO phase of the mission was to completely characterize Ceres' gravity field to help mission planners design the lowest phase of Dawn's orbital journey. Also during the HAMO phase, a \"surprising bonus,\" as described by Dawn's teams, came from the spacecraft's gamma ray and neutron spectrometer, which detected three bursts of energetic electrons that may result from the interaction between Ceres and radiation from the sun. \"This is a very unexpected observation for which we are now testing hypotheses,\" said Mr. Russell. By the beginning of October, the third science and HAMO aspect of the mission was complete, and Dawn fired its ion engine again to lower itself to its lowest and final orbit of the mission, just 375 km above the surface of Ceres. The seven-week burn began on 23 October, and by early December, Dawn was in a 385 km orbit, providing image resolution of 35 m per pixel. Among the striking first views obtained from this altitude - known as the Low- Altitude Mapping Orbit - were a chain of craters called Gerber Catena, located just west of the large crater Urvara as well as a series of troughs. While troughs are common on larger planetary bodies and are caused by contraction, impact stresses and the loading of the crust by large mountains, they are not commonly seen on smaller planetary bodies. Thus, the fracturing found all across Ceres' surface indicates that similar processes may have occurred on this dwarf planet, despite its small size. However, just after this orbit lowering maneuver ended, scientists using data gathered in the previous nine months of Dawn's operations at Ceres revealed a possible reason for the bright spots that pepper the dwarf planet. In a study that appeared in the journal Nature, study authors, led by Andreas Nathues at Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, stated that the bright material was consistent with a type of magnesium sulfate called hexahydrite. A different type of magnesium sulfate than what is present on Ceres is commonly known on Earth as Epsom salt. The study suggests that these salt-rich areas were left behind when water-ice sublimated as impacts from asteroids would have unearthed the mixture of ice and salt, which there is currently no evidence of. Furthermore, \"The global nature of Ceres' bright spots suggests that this world has a subsurface layer that contains briny water-ice,\" Nathues said. This seems to link with another aspect of the same study which found a diffuse haze near the surface of Occator crater - where the two now-famous bright spots are located - that fills the floor of the crater. The study suggests that this may be associated with observations of water vapor at Ceres by the Herschel Space Observatory first detected in 2014. The haze is present in views during noon, local time, and absent at dawn and dusk, suggesting that the phenomenon resembles activity at the surface of a comet, with water vapor lifting tiny particles of dust and residual ice. As 2015 drew to a close, Dawn, its mission controllers, and scientists paused to mark the 215th anniversary of the discovery of Ceres on 1 January 1801. Now firmly in the final aspect of its mission, Dawn is expected to continue operations until at least mid-2016. At present, there are no plans to crash Dawn onto the surface of Ceres. Instead, it is understood that mission planners will ensure that Dawn is in a perpetually stable orbit of Ceres. Thus, when Dawn's mission officially ends sometime this year, the spacecraft will become a permanent artificial satellite of the dwarf planet in the asteroid belt.

NASA's Dawn probe arrived at Ceres - the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter - on March 6, 2015, and has been mapping the dwarf planet in detail ever since. \"Ceres has defied our expectations and surprised us in many ways, thanks to a year's worth of data from Dawn,\" Dawn deputy principal investigator Carol Raymond, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. \"We are hard at work on the mysteries the spacecraft has presented to us.\" Chief among those mysteries are Ceres' intriguing bright spots, and a 3-mile- high mountain known as Ahuna Mons. Ceres' bright patches lie at the bottom of craters - most famously, a 56-mile- wide hole in the ground called Occator. For a while, mission scientists debated whether these reflective spots are composed of water ice or salts; the current thinking leans heavily toward salts, in particular hydrated magnesium sulfates. Ahuna Mons remains more mysterious. The dome-shaped, steep-sided mountain, which is taller than the United States' Mount Rainier and Mount Whitney, features bright streaks on some of its slopes, but Dawn scientists aren't sure what they're made of. And nobody yet knows just how Ahuna Mons came to be. \"No one expected a mountain on Ceres, especially one like Ahuna Mons,\" Dawn principal investigator Chris Russell, of the University of California, Los Angeles, said in the same statement. \"We still do not have a satisfactory model to explain how it formed.\" The $466 million Dawn mission launched in September 2007, tasked with orbiting and studying the two largest objects in the asteroid belt - the 330-mile-wide protoplanet Vesta, and Ceres, which is about 590 miles across. The main goal is to gain insights into the solar system's early days by observing these two leftovers from the planet-formation period - hence the mission's name. Dawn arrived at Vesta in July 2011 and departed for Ceres in September 2012. When Dawn reached the latter destination, it became the first probe ever to orbit two separate objects beyond the Earth-moon system. Dawn has eyed Ceres from four successively closer-in orbits over the past year. The spacecraft is now in its final orbit, which lies just 240 miles from Ceres' surface. Dawn will continue studying the dwarf planet from this perch for the remainder of its mission, which is scheduled to end on June 30, 2016.

When the Collier Trophy went to Wright in 1913, airplanes were still just in their infancy. It was, after all, only a decade after he and his brother Wilbur made that short but momentous flight at Kitty Hawk. Airplanes were still a novelty, the purview mostly of tinkerers, inventors and daredevils. The latest Collier Trophy, awarded this week, went to an achievement in flight that the Wright brothers could scarcely have imagined. The National Aeronautic Association bestowed the honor, one of the most prestigious in aviation and space travel as well, to a team at NASA and its Jet Propulsion Lab for the Dawn program that sent a spacecraft on a long-distance exploration through the solar system. The Dawn spacecraft, launched in 2007, has already studied the protoplanet Vesta and more recently turned its attention to dwarf planet Ceres in the asteroid belt. It won the award, the NAA said in a statement Thursday, for those \"extraordinary achievements\" and \"for \"advancing the nation's technological capabilities in pioneering new frontiers in space travel.\" The nominees for the 2015 trophy spanned a wide range of machines and missions, from the HA-420 HondaJet light business plane to the US military's C-5M Super Galaxy and the Two Eagles balloon team that last year flew across the Pacific Ocean. Also in the group were Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos-backed company looking to make reusable rockets a reality, and the Icon A5, a light sport plane that CNET's Roger Cheng got to fly last year. Blue Origin didn't seem to mind not winning. It tweeted : \"@NASA Dawn team gave us new views & great science. Congrats on 2015 Collier Trophy!\" Since the Collier Trophy was first awarded in 1911, it has acknowledged some spectacular feats, including the breaking of the sound barrier in 1947 by the experimental X-1 aircraft, the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 and several round-the-world flights over the years. Sometimes it's recognized what hasn't happened, as in 1922, when the US Air Mail Service took the prize \"for a year's operation without a single fatal accident.\" The award, focused on achievements in the American air and space community, is as focused on safety and efficiency as it is on performance. Cessna Aircraft won in 1985 for \"an unparalleled passenger safety record\" over a 14-year span, and in its first decade, the prize went twice to Elmer Sperry, for his work on gyroscopic controls and a drift indicator. Orville Wright's win? It was for development of the automatic stabilizer.

Today, NASA's Dawn spacecraft has just released images it took orbiting just 240 miles above the surface, where we can now resolve features as small as 115 feet across. What we found was a world that was not only full of small and mid-sized craters, somewhat resembling our Moon, but that held a number of mysteries, including a dearth of large craters, strange white spots at various locations along the surface, and a crust that varied wildly in its chemical makeup. But the latest data release solves a number of mysteries, and does so spectacularly. In addition to cameras, you see, the Dawn spacecraft has a number of detailed instruments on board that are sensitive to color differences, the presence or absence of molecules, the emission of gamma rays and much, much more. Here are the three biggest pieces of knowledge we've just uncovered, each of which illustrates how science is a progressive process, and that new knowledge reveals new questions to answer. 1.) The ultra-bright spots inside Occator crater. Back in December, we learned that Ceres' white spots in Occator crater are salt, but just why these white spots were so bright and isolated remained a puzzle. These salt flats outshine every other location on Ceres' surface, even the other white spots, as they reflect a far greater percentage of sunlight than anywhere else, and are only found at the bottom of this crater. This new suite of data revealed a fantastic explanation: the bright, salty regions we see? They are atop a dome-like region at a lower elevation than any other location on the world measured thus far. Occator crater is four kilometers deep, and the dome at the center is an extremely suggestive feature for the origin of these salts, which appear in only a few isolated, deposited locations. An impactor -- the one that caused the crater -- kicked up sub-surface volatiles and water. Minerals dissolved inside the water, and when the water evaporated/sublimated, the salts were left behind. The crater-causing impact phenomenon created a weakness in the crater's bottom, and a geological feature, an eruption of some sort, deposited the salts. Or, the fissures, cracks and streaks on the dome wall point to recent geologic activity, where perhaps subsurface ice/water came upwards and left a trail of salty deposits behind. Geologic dating of this crater, which requires better mapping and improved geometric analysis of the walls, floor and dome, should help us determine which explanation is the best. 2.) The likely presence of sub-surface ice, but only at the poles. There's an instrument aboard Dawn -- the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector -- which began acquiring data from Ceres in December. Gamma rays and neutron are emitted where cosmic rays interact with the minerals all over Ceres. Over much of the surface, it points to the existence of carbon-based and silicon-based minerals, with roughly uniform amounts of neutrons giving evidence to that. But the polar regions are sparser in neutrons than all the other locations, indicating that there's more hydrogen at these high latitudes. Hydrogen, of course, is a key ingredient in water. But there's no water visible at the poles anywhere, indicating that it's probably sub-surface water, likely within the top meter of Ceres' top layer of material. As future data comes in from GRaND, we should be able to determine both the presence and abundances of water at these locations. \"Our analyses will test a longstanding prediction that water ice can survive just beneath Ceres' cold, high-latitude surface for billions of years,\" according to Tom Pettyman, the leader of the GRaND instrument. 3.) The second brightest crater on Ceres, Oxo, is the only location that exhibits surface water. This small, 9 kilometer wide crater is most likely very young, as water ice should sublimate in the sunlight on timescales of a few million years at most: much shorter than the lifetime of this world. Either it's one of the most recent impact craters, and practically all impact craters dredge up subsurface water, or there's been recent landslide that exposed this water. Future analyses should be able to reveals whether there's other water-ice on the surface, as well as determining whether this is pure water-ice, or whether this is frozen water that's bound into minerals, making them more stable against sublimation than water-ice on its own. Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt, and as Dawn is showing us, is quite different from the other asteroid it observed and mapped: Vesta. As Carol Raymond, deputy-PI of Dawn, related: \"We're excited to unveil these beautiful new images, especially Occator, which illustrate the complexity of the processes shaping Ceres' surface. Now that we can see Ceres' enigmatic bright spots, surface minerals and morphology in high resolution, we're busy working to figure out what processes shaped this unique dwarf planet. By comparing Ceres with Vesta, we'll glean new insights about the early solar system.\" Perhaps there are even greater mysteries still to be solved by this mission.

It is the first ever spacecraft to visit two different asteroids, a hop-on, hop-off tour made possible thanks to Dawn's low-thrust ion drive, which uses electricity to spit out xenon ions rather than conventional rocket fuel. This summer, Dawn's Ceres mission will officially end. But earlier this week, principal investigator Chris Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles and his team sent a proposal to NASA for an extension. Secret destination Spacecraft at the end of their life are normally parked in an out-of-the-way orbit, or crash land on the body they have been studying. That's the plan for the Rosetta probe, which will touch down on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko later this year, but that fate won't be possible for Dawn. \"The spacecraft has not been sterilised, so we aren't allowed to touch down on the surface of Ceres,\" says Russell. Strict planetary protection rules forbid us sending Earth microbes to other worlds. \"Instead, we want to go the other way, away from Ceres, to visit yet another target.\" Given the small amount of xenon fuel remaining, the list of potential destinations is probably not too long, but Russell is keeping it a secret for now. \"As long as the mission extension has not been approved by NASA, I'm not going to tell you which asteroid we plan to visit,\" he says. \"I hope a decision won't take months.\" ", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2085288-nasas-dawn-probe-may-visit-third-asteroid-after-ceres-and-vesta/"}, {"title": "NASA's Dawn Spacecraft Completes Primary Mission", "date": "2016-06-30", "content": "NASA's Dawn spacecraft completes its primary mission, exceeding all expectations.

The historic mission is the first to orbit two extraterrestrial solar system targets, and the first to orbit any object in the main asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter. On March 6, 2015, Dawn also became the first spacecraft to enter orbit around a dwarf planet. An infographic highlights some of the accomplishments of Dawn's journey since launching in September 2007. Dawn has traveled 3.5 billion miles (5.6 billion kilometers) since launch, and has made 2,450 orbits around Vesta and Ceres. The spacecraft has returned about 69,000 images, combined, of both bodies. Dawn's advanced ion propulsion system made it possible for the spacecraft to orbit two targets in the main asteroid belt. The spacecraft has logged about 48,000 hours of ion engine thrusting. Scientists have learned a great deal about these unique, massive residents of the asteroid belt through data from the mission. Dawn has revealed that while Vesta is a dry body, Ceres could be as much as 25 percent water ice by mass.

NASA announced July 1 the outcome of a review of extended planetary science missions, including the approval of plans to send New Horizons past a distant Kuiper Belt object and the extension of seven other missions at the moon and Mars. Dawn, which completed its primary mission June 30, had proposed an extended mission where the spacecraft would leave its current orbit around Ceres and travel to another asteroid. Project officials declined to name that asteroid, saying that they would identify it if NASA approved the extended mission. However, in a mission update posted to the Dawn web site late June 30, only to be removed within minutes, the mission did identify that destination: the asteroid 145 Adeona, a main belt asteroid about 150 kilometers across that Dawn would fly by in May 2019. The NASA statement July 1 about the mission extension confirmed the planned target was Adeona. Jim Green, director of NASA's planetary science division, said in a statement that the decision to keep Dawn at Ceres was driven by the science it would provide in the opinion of the senior review panel. \"The long-term monitoring of Ceres, particularly as it gets closer to perihelion - the part of its orbit with the shortest distance to the sun - has the potential to provide more significant science discoveries than a flyby of Adeona,\" he said. Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator for Dawn, said in a June 28 presentation at a meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory that the project proposed the Adeona flyby because they believed visiting a different asteroid would be of more interest than remaining at Ceres. Dawn, she noted, had completed all of its main scientific priorities at Ceres earlier this year. \"I think we've gotten so much already that the incremental amount of knowledge that we would gain would be maybe not as great as one would have thought,\" she said of an extended mission at Ceres. The possibility of an extended mission to another asteroid was possible because of steps the project took to conserve the spacecraft's supply of hydrazine used for stationkeeping and attitude control thrusters. The project started those efforts in 2012 while still in orbit around another asteroid, Vesta, because problems with two of its reaction control wheels threatened to use up all of its hydrazine before completing its mission at Ceres. \"The team worked very hard to execute an aggressive and persistent campaign to preserve the hydrazine,\" Raymond said, crediting \"exceptionally smooth\" operations of the spacecraft that limited consumption of the fuel. \"In 2016, we ended up not only achieving our intended mission, but with a surplus which we can now use to do something else.\" Dawn launched in 2007 and orbited the main belt asteroid Vesta from July 2011 to September 2012. It then departed for Ceres, arriving in March 2015. Dawn used an electric propulsion system to travel through the asteroid belt, and planned to use it again to fly past Adeona. The remaining hydrazine, Raymond said, should allow Dawn to operate at Ceres until March or April 2017. That date could be moved up if the spacecraft suffers new problems with its reaction wheels that require additional use of its thrusters. The Dawn project had been pressing for an answer from NASA on its extended mission proposal because of a tight schedule. \"We're on a very tight timeline to leave Ceres by July 12 in order not to expend more hydrazine at Ceres, because we'll rapidly run out of the ability to leave Ceres and go any place else,\" she said at the SBAG meeting. While the senior review was a disappointment for Dawn, it was good, although not unexpected, news for New Horizons. NASA approved plans for an extended mission to send the spacecraft past the distant Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019. The project had already performed a series of maneuvers after its July 2015 flyby of Pluto, its primary mission, to set up that flyby if NASA approved its extended mission. \"The New Horizons mission to Pluto exceeded our expectations and even today the data from the spacecraft continue to surprise,\" Green said in a statement. \"We're excited to continue onward into the dark depths of the outer solar system to a science target that wasn't even discovered when the spacecraft launched.\" The senior review also approved an extension of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and six Mars missions: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution orbiter, the Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers, the Mars Odyssey orbiter and NASA's support for the European Space Agency's Mars Express mission.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-rejects-plan-to-send-dawn-to-another-asteroid/"}, {"title": "Crater 'Cold Traps' May Hide Ice On Dwarf Planet Ceres", "date": "2016-07-19", "content": "On the surface of the dwarf planet Ceres, certain regions could be cold enough to host long-lasting deposits of water ice, a rarely seen phenomenon on objects similar to Ceres, a new study shows. Investigators using data from NASA's Dawn mission - which has been orbiting Ceres since March 2015 - identified dozens of zones in the dwarf planet's northern hemisphere that could host water ice for a billion years, according to a statement from NASA. These so-called \"cold traps\" occupy a small region, less than 1 percent the hemisphere's size, and totaling roughly 695 square miles. That's about two-thirds the land area of Rhode Island. You can see a video explaining the discovery here. If ice is found in these areas, it would put Ceres in a select group of large solar system bodies with tenuous-atmospheres that have known long-lasting deposits of water ice. In recent years, NASA missions also found permanently shadowed craters containing ice on the planet Mercury and on Earth's moon. The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission also found water ice on the much smaller Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, although the mission scientists said that the comet's elongated orbit around the sun makes it unlikely that the surface ice is long-lasting. \"The conditions on Ceres are right for accumulating deposits of water ice,\" said Norbert Schorghofer, a Dawn guest investigator at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, in a statement from NASA. \"Ceres has just enough mass to hold on to water molecules, and the permanently shadowed regions we identified are extremely cold - colder than most that exist on the moon or Mercury.\" The shadowy spots on Ceres tend to be on crater floors, or in crater areas facing toward the dwarf planet's north pole. While some indirect sunlight falls in these regions, ice could accumulate if the temperature stays below minus 240 Fahrenheit. The new study is the first time these \"cold traps,\" have been found on Ceres, the statement said. Researchers discovered the zones by looking at images of Ceres' northern hemisphere, which was more illuminated than images of the dwarf planet's southern hemisphere, the statement said. These images were combined to create 3D views of craters, plains and other parts of the dwarf planet. To find out what proportion of Ceres receives direct sunlight, researchers then fed the 3D maps into a computer model developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The model predicts how much solar radiation strikes the surface, and how conditions change during a year on Ceres. The model showed that permanently shadowed regions go down to \"relatively low latitudes,\" said Erwan Mazarico, a Dawn guest investigator at Goddard, in the same statement. \"On the moon and Mercury, only the permanently shadowed regions very close to the poles get cold enough for ice to be stable on the surface,\" he said. Mercury and Ceres share a similar percentage of land area that's capable of trapping water ice, and the two bodies likely also accumulate water ice at the same rate, the statement said. It's estimated that one out of every 1,000 molecules generated on Ceres' surface will move to a cold trap within a year on the dwarf planet. At this rate, ice deposits on Ceres would build up to a detectable level in about 100,000 years. The findings were published on July 6 in Geophysical Research Letters.

But scientists have powerful data to study Ceres' inner structure: Dawn's own motion. Since gravity dominates Dawn's orbit at Ceres, scientists can measure variations in Ceres' gravity by tracking subtle changes in the motion of the spacecraft. Using data from Dawn, scientists have mapped the variations in Ceres' gravity for the first time in a new study in the journal Nature, which provides clues to the dwarf planet's internal structure. \"The new data suggest that Ceres has a weak interior, and that water and other light materials partially separated from rock during a heating phase early in its history,\" said Ryan Park, the study's lead author and the supervisor of the solar system dynamics group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. Ceres' gravity field is measured by monitoring radio signals sent to Dawn, and then received back on Earth, by NASA's Deep Space Network. This network is a collection of large antennas at three locations around the globe that communicate with interplanetary spacecraft. Using these signals, scientists can measure the spacecraft's speed to a precision of 0.004 inches per second, and then calculate the details of the gravity field. Ceres has a special property called \"hydrostatic equilibrium,\" which was confirmed in this study. This means that Ceres' interior is weak enough that its shape is governed by how it rotates. Scientists reached this conclusion by comparing Ceres' gravity field to its shape. Ceres' hydrostatic equilibrium is one reason why astronomers classified the body as a dwarf planet in 2006. The data indicate that Ceres is \"differentiated,\" which means that it has compositionally distinct layers at different depths, with the densest layer at the core. Scientists also have found that, as they suspected, Ceres is much less dense than Earth, the Moon, giant asteroid Vesta and other rocky bodies in our solar system. Additionally, Ceres has long been suspected to contain low-density materials such as water ice, which the study shows separated from the rocky material and rose to the outer layer along with other light materials. \"We have found that the divisions between different layers are less pronounced inside Ceres than the Moon and other planets in our solar system,\" Park said. \"Earth, with its metallic core, semi-fluid mantle and outer crust, has a more clearly defined structure than Ceres,\" Park said. Scientists also found that high-elevation areas on Ceres displace mass in the interior. This is analogous to how a boat floats on water: the amount of displaced water depends on the mass of the boat. Similarly, scientists conclude that Ceres' weak mantle can be pushed aside by the mass of mountains and other high topography in the outermost layer as though the high-elevation areas \"float\" on the material below. This phenomenon has been observed on other planets, including Earth, but this study is the first to confirm it at Ceres. The internal density structure, based on the new gravity data, teaches scientists about what internal processes could have occurred during the early history of Ceres. By combining this new information with previous data from Dawn about Ceres' surface composition, they can reconstruct that history: Water must have been mobile in the ancient subsurface, but the interior did not heat up to the temperatures at which silicates melt and a metallic core forms. \"We know from previous Dawn studies that there must have been interactions between water and rock inside Ceres,\" said Carol Raymond, a co-author and Dawn's deputy principal investigator based at JPL. \"That, combined with the new density structure, tells us that Ceres experienced a complex thermal history.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2016/08/05/dawns-gravity-data-probes-interior-of-dwarf-planet-ceres/"}, {"title": "Engineering alumnus John Brophy revolutionizes space travel with ion propulsion", "date": "2016-08-10", "content": "The National Aeronautic Association has named the NASA Dawn Mission Team the winner of the 2015 Robert J. Collier Trophy. Colorado State University mechanical engineering alumnus John Brophy is a member of that team and was responsible for developing of the ion propulsion system used on the nearly decade-long Dawn Mission, enabling it to visit the two heaviest main belt asteroids - the giant asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres. Brophy received his master's degree in 1980, and his Ph.D. in 1984. Launched in September 2007, Dawn is currently orbiting Ceres. The mission's goal is to gather data from Vesta and Ceres, bodies believed to have formed early in our solar system's history, to shed light on the characteristics of our early solar system and the processes that dominated its formation. Dawn is the first spacecraft in history to visit two extraterrestrial bodies, made possible by revolutionary ion propulsion breakthroughs developed by Brophy and his team. This honor is awarded to only the greatest achievers in aeronautics or astronautics in the U.S. with respect to improving the performance, efficiency, and safety of air or space vehicles. Previous winners have included Orville Wright in 1913, the crew of Apollo 11 in 1969, Global Positioning System in 1992, and the Mars Science Laboratory in 2012, just to name a few - and now John Brophy and the rest of the Dawn Mission Team can add their names to this impressive list of pioneers. What makes ion propulsion so groundbreaking? It allows us to reach farther and deeper destinations in space on spacecraft that use an unlimited source of energy from the sun. Traditionally, deep space missions are made on chemical rockets with limited energy available; however, this mission was carried out on an ion propulsion system using an external energy source, the sun. For Dawn's mission, Brophy's lab, at the NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory, developed a propulsion system that collects energy using large solar arrays and converts it into electricity, which is then run through the thrusters allowing for unlimited energy sent to the propellant. The propellant releases from the spacecraft at a speed 10 times higher than previous rocket engines resulting in a spacecraft that is 10 times more fuel-efficient. Before this technology was recognized by NASA and used on the Deep Space 1 and Dawn missions, Brophy had many trials and tribulations with ion propulsion technology. Brophy became interested in ion propulsion in graduate school at CSU where he was a student of ME professor emeritus, Dr. Paul Wilbur. Upon graduation in 1980, Brophy got a job at the Marshall Space Flight Center and worked on a project called the Solar Electric Propulsion System, with the goal of building an ion propulsion spacecraft using mercury as the propellant. The project never came to fruition, in part, because of mercury's environmental disadvantages. The ion propulsion system used on Dawn runs on xenon as the propellant, an environmentally safe alternative. Ion propulsion systems have actually been around for a long time; however, it's challenging to make an ion thruster last long enough to be useful, and it's also difficult to master the blend of elements used to make ion propulsion successful. After the ion propulsion system development at Marshall was canceled, Brophy once again collaborated with Dr. Wilbur at CSU for his Ph.D. to gain a better understanding of ion thrusters. After completing his Ph.D. in 1984, he joined JPL and eventually became the project element manager for Dawn's ion propulsion system development. In the early 1990s, Brophy convinced NASA's New Millennium Program, which was designed to flight-test new technologies, that flight-testing an ion propulsion system was the most important thing it could do. Finally, in 1998, the New Millennium's Deep Space 1 spacecraft was successfully tested on an ion propulsion system, and this set the groundwork for flying Dawn using ion propulsion. The Deep Space 1 spacecraft spent about 16,000 hours in space, but Dawn shattered that record at about 50,000 hours in space - the longest- ever operation of a propulsion system in deep space. It became the highest-powered spacecraft that JPL had ever built for a deep space mission. Dawn's ion propulsion system provided a far larger change in velocity to the spacecraft than any propulsion system in history.

This dwarf planet is the largest body in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and was the first to be discovered. But, until recently, we have only had information from ground and space-based telescopes, which have given us tantalising glimpses of a dark, possibly water-rich object. Now the Dawn space probe has sent back a bumper harvest of findings, summarised in six new research papers published in a special issue of the journal Science. We now have a map of Ceres that reveals unusual minerals, a surface peppered with craters, and water in the form of ice and possibly an outer atmosphere of vapour. There's also enough uncertainty in the results to sow the seeds for future research. The data provides a global geological map of the asteroid showing that its entire surface appears to be covered in phyllosilicates, an important group of clay minerals. Two specific clays are identified: one that is magnesium-rich, the second an ammonium-rich species. There seems to be little or no pattern to the distribution of the two minerals - they are both almost everywhere.This ubiquity is what is important. The minerals could not have been formed in a local event, such as an impact into an ice-filled crater. They must have been produced by planet-wide alteration, presumably implying there must have been volumes of water. It is clear that enormous quantities of liquid water are not present on Ceres now. But the signal of water-ice has been detected in at least one crater. Because the temperature of Ceres is relatively warm, water-ice exposed at the surface would rapidly convert into a gas in such a low-pressure environment. So the discovered traces of water-ice suggest some underground ice was recently exposed and that there must be some mechanism to explain how the surface was disturbed in this way. Some researchers think that the answer is cryovolcanism, where subsurface layers of mixed ice and minerals percolate slowly to the surface through cracks and fractures, or more swiftly following an impact. If the minerals are chlorides, then a low temperature brine can keep the subsurface layer mobile. As well as a geological map of Ceres, we also have a picture of Ceres' global geomorphology. This shows that the surface of Ceres is peppered with impact craters, although the craters are not distributed evenly over the surface. Much more interesting are the three distinct types of mineral flow across the landscape, produced by the movement of ice-rich material, landslides or blankets of ejected particles following impact into ice-rich material. The distribution of the flow types varies with latitude - and the researchers think this means different surface layers of the asteroid contain different amounts of ice. One of the most remarkable results is the detection of a sudden burst of highly energetic electrons over a period of around a week in June 2015, coinciding with a solar proton storm. The researchers think the protons fired out by the sun interacted with particles in Ceres' weak atmosphere, creating a shock wave that accelerated the electrons. Based on observations by the Hubble Space Telescope, Ceres is believed to have a tenuous exosphere of water vapour. The results from Dawn suggest that this may indeed be the case. Together, this new set of information shows that Ceres is a world that has been shaped by a series of events, with a strong crust of magnesium- and ammonium-bearing phyllosilicates overlying an interior of briny ice and hydrated minerals. What other hidden secrets will be revealed as research continues on the trove of data from Ceres? Questions still remain about the variety of mineral deposits, the depth of the subsurface ice-rock layer, and, of course, the potential for organic material on the minor planet. The harvest from Ceres so far has been rich and promises to keep us busy for years to come.

Since July 1, Dawn has been in an extended mission. In fact, all mission objectives were met by the end of March 2016, and continuing observations allowed for full imaging of the protoplanet at 115-foot resolution. The original plan was for 650-foot resolution global imaging with selected targets only at 35 meters. So now we have a data set of both 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres that where not thought even feasible at launch at Dawn's September 2007 launch. All in all, the Dawn mission has been an enormous success, bringing into fantastic detail the largest and third- largest members of the asteroid belt. Thus Dawn has been in space for nine years. It was launched with four gyroscopes - three working and one backup - to enable it to maintain a stable orientation. Now Dawn has only two working gyroscopes, as No. 1 and the backup No. 4 have both failed. Back in June when the original mission was coming up to its original end date, engineering data showed that the Dawn spacecraft was still fully operational, with the solar arrays having degraded a little, but still producing ample power and still enough hydrazine left for at least another year of operation. Ahuna Mons on Ceres, as from overhead by Dawn spacecraft. This led to some interesting ideas. The main one initially was for the Dawn spacecraft to start spiralling away from Ceres in July 2016. It might have gone back into solar orbit and made a nearly three-year trip for a very close, slow encounter with the large main belt asteroid 145 Adeona in May 2019. However, the science committee in NASA decided instead to keep the Dawn spacecraft in orbit around Ceres. Since September 2, 2016, Dawn has been climbing back up to a second phase of its High Altitude Mapping Orbit to an orbital altitude of 915 miles, but this time will be passing over the 1 p.m. to 1 a.m. line on Ceres, whereas in the original HAMO orbit the orbital track was close to the terminator at roughly the 6 a.m. - 6 p.m. line. This new orientation of the orbiter will enable viewing of features under a higher sun, and thus warmer terrain. As Ceres reaches perihelion in April 2018, Dawn may spy activity. It has also been determined that the curious mountain on Ceres - Ahuna Mons - is indeed a cryovolcano, made from frozen muddy, salty ice. This mountain is 16,400 feet 5,000 meters) tall from its base on Ceres' lowlands. It lies antipodal to the large Kerwan Crater. This positioning now appears to be related. The impact that created the Kerwan Crater sent massive seismic waves through Ceres and they converged exactly opposite to the point of impact. The seismic waves shattered the crust here and temporarily compressed the subsurface, ice rich crust, warming it, causing eruptions, creating this huge mountain. Ceres is approximately 599 miles wide through its equator and 554 miles through its poles, a difference of 7.5%. It orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between the planets Mars and Jupiter, completing a single orbit once every 4 years, 7 months and 6 days. Ceres rotates once every 9 hours 4 minutes in a prograde direction. The surface gravity of Ceres is 0.029 or 1/34th that on Earth. The density of Ceres suggests it is 70% rock and 30% ice in composition, very similar to Eris and Pluto. There have been suggestions that Ceres did indeed originate in the realm of the outer solar system where Eris and Pluto reside - the Kuiper Belt - then was ejected inwards and was sent into an orbit within the asteroid belt by Jupiter. But Ceres may also have formed close to its current orbit. In the early solar system, the infant sun was approximately 30% dimmer than now, so that region was much colder than now. Jupiter probably prevented Ceres from forming into a fully fledged planet. A recent discovery made by the Hubble Space Telescope suggests minor plume activity when Ceres is at perihelion, closest point to the sun, with plume activity lining up with two large impact craters, showing that two relatively recent impacts have exposed ice rich materials. The mountain is 4 km high and 17 km wide in this south-looking view. Fracturing is observed on the mountain's top, whereas streaks from rockfalls dominate the flanks. Via Science.

Bottom line: The Dawn spacecraft has been orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres - largest body in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter - since March 2015. The spacecraft went into an extended mission phase on July 1, 2016. It has been spectacularly successful. Some mission highlights and current thinking, here.

But picture a volcano where, instead of lava, freezing material slowly pours out. Such an icy volcano - known as a cryovolcano - has been discovered on the dwarf planet Ceres by NASA's Dawn spacecraft. Ahuna Mons is an isolated mountain that stands four kilometres high. Volcanoes on Earth have many different formation mechanisms; one of the most common being a tectonic plate slipping under another. As the misfortunate plate melts, magma is forced upwards to form a volcano and this plate subduction is responsible for the volcanoes in the \"Pacific Ring of Fire\". Ceres is nothing like the Earth. It is a rocky and icy body only 945 kilometres in diameter - and it does not have plate tectonics. However, it is still possible to draw parallels between Ahuna Mons and certain volcanoes on Earth. \"Ahuna Mons is a cryovolcanic construct similar in morphology to what we call silicic domes on Earth: volcanoes built from very pasty, high viscosity thickness lavas, rich in silica,\" explains David Williams of Arizona State University, co-author of the paper that appeared in the journal Science. Partially molten material beneath the surface is more buoyant than the surrounding rocks, and therefore rose up through the surface and oozed out, forming the dome of the cryovolcano. Cryovolcanism was previously thought to only involve water and water ice. However, Ahuna Mons is actually a \"salty mud\" mix - and the only known volcano of its kind. \"The discovery at Ceres suggests that cryovolcanism can occur also with a different composition, involving salty water, carbonates, and clays,\" said Ottaviano Ruesch of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, and lead author of the study. \"We do not observe ice on the cryovolcano suggesting that water is not a major component. So this tell us we have more diversity, more geologic and volcanic diversity within the Solar System as previously recognised.\" Ahuna Mons is also surprisingly young in geological terms. It most likely formed no more than a billion years ago, and possibly even within the last few hundred million years. For cryovolcanism - or indeed terrestrial volcanism - to occur, there must be an internal heat source. Planets and moons in the Solar System can retain heat from their formation billions of years ago, although they will gradually cool down. This is what happened on Mars. While it boasts the largest volcano in the Solar System - Olympus Mons - this volcano is long extinct because Mars has cooled due its small size. The internal heat necessary for volcanism can also occur due to the gravitational pull of a nearby body creating tides. The moon Io is the most volcanic body in the Solar System due to its orbit around Jupiter. But Ceres is a small body that should have cooled long ago, and due to its isolated position orbiting between Mars and Jupiter it doesn't experience any tides. \"Recent cryovolcanism on Ceres is telling us that the energy was not easily lost into space as previously thought,\" Ruesch tells Skymania News. \"Still, temperatures in the interior of Ceres are not warm, we are talking about temperatures around 230 degree Kelvin -43 decrees Celsius. Ahuna Mons demonstrates that such conditions are nevertheless enough to sustain some amount of melt, perhaps locally, in pockets in the subsurface.\" Cryovolcanism is also present elsewhere on Ceres, and it doesn't always build mountains. There are craters that appear too shallow compared to what would be expected from a meteorite impact. Some craters also show cracks where cryomagma could have been pushed out to resurface the crater floor. The type of cryovolcanism at these craters is different from that which built Ahuna Mons. \"Ahuna Mons was built by extrusive flow of cryolavas apparently without any explosive eruptions,\" said Williams. \"In contrast, the bright spots in Occator crater appear to have involved explosive 'venting' of briny water rich materials, where the water vapour boiled away and left bright minerals like salts and carbonates behind.\" The Dawn spacecraft will continue to orbit Ceres for at least another year, no doubt bringing many more exciting discoveries.

Dawn snapped this image on 16 October, from its fifth science orbit, in which the angle of the Sun was different from that in previous orbits. Dawn was about 920 miles above Ceres when this image was taken - an altitude the spacecraft had reached in early October. Occator Crater, with its central bright region and secondary, less-reflective areas, appears quite prominent near the limb, or edge, of Ceres. At 57 miles wide and 2 1/2 miles deep, Occator displays evidence of recent geologic activity. The latest research suggests that the bright material in this crater is comprised of salts left behind after a briny liquid emerged from below, froze and then sublimated, meaning it turned from ice into vapour. The impact that formed the crater millions of years ago unearthed material that blanketed the area outside the crater, and may have triggered the upwelling of salty liquid. \"This image captures the wonder of soaring above this fascinating, unique world that Dawn is the first to explore,\" said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. Dawn scientists also have released an image of Ceres that approximates how the dwarf planet's colours would appear to the human eye. This view, produced by the German Aerospace Center in Berlin, combines images taken from Dawn's first science orbit in 2015, using the framing camera's red, green and blue filters. The colour was calculated based on the way Ceres reflects different wavelengths of light. The spacecraft has gathered tens of thousands of images and other information from Ceres since arriving in orbit on 6 March 2015. After spending more than eight months studying Ceres at an altitude of about 240 miles, closer than the International Space Station is to Earth, Dawn headed for a higher vantage point in August. In October, while the spacecraft was at its 920-mile altitude, it returned images and other valuable insights about Ceres. On 4 November, Dawn began making its way to a sixth science orbit, which will be over 4,500 miles from Ceres. While Dawn needed to make several changes in its direction while spiralling between most previous orbits at Ceres, engineers have figured out a way for the spacecraft to arrive at this next orbit while the ion engine thrusts in the same direction that Dawn is already going. This uses less hydrazine and xenon fuel than Dawn's normal spiral manoeuvres. Dawn should reach this next orbit in early December. One goal of Dawn's sixth science orbit is to refine previously collected measurements. The spacecraft's gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer, which has been investigating the composition of Ceres' surface, will characterise the radiation from cosmic rays unrelated to Ceres. This will allow scientists to subtract \"noise\" from measurements of Ceres, making the information more precise. The spacecraft is healthy as it continues to operate in its extended mission phase, which began in July. During the primary mission, Dawn orbited and accomplished all of its original objectives at Ceres and protoplanet Vesta, which the spacecraft visited from July 2011 to September 2012.

In October, Dawn, which has been orbiting Ceres since March 2015, travelled at the lowest altitude in its mission so far - 1,480 kilometres above the surface. It was able to capture unprecedented images of several bright regions located in one particularly interesting region, Occator Crater. Ceres is found in the asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It is the largest dwarf planet in the region, accounting for 25 per cent of the belt's total mass. When Dawn first sent back images of the surface in 2015, scientists were perplexed as to the composition of the bright spots, which they now believe to be formed by a variety of salts. Occator Crater is about 92 kilometres wide and four kilometres deep. Research suggests that the crater has seen recent geological activity, which has pushed up a salty brine from the subsurface.

The discovery, reported in a pair of studies published in the journals Science and Nature Astronomy, could bolster fledgling commercial endeavors to mine asteroids for water and other resources for robotic and eventual human expeditions beyond the moon. NASA's Dawn spacecraft has been orbiting Ceres, the largest of thousands of rocky bodies located in the main asteroid belt, since March 2015 following 14-month study of Vesta, the second-largest object in the asteroid belt. The studies show that Ceres is about 10 percent water, now frozen into ice, according to physicist Thomas Prettyman of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, one of the researchers. Examining the makeup of solar system objects like Ceres provides insight into how the solar system formed. Compared to dry Vesta, Ceres is more like Enceladus and Europa, icy moons of the giant gas planets Saturn and Jupiter respectively, than Earth and the other terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus and Mars, Prettyman added. Scientists are debating if Ceres hides a briny liquid ocean, a prospect that may put the dwarf planet on the growing list of worlds beyond the solar system that may be suitable for life, said Dawn deputy lead scientist Carol Raymond of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"By finding bodies that were water-rich in the distant past, we can discover clues as to where life may have existed in the early solar system,\" Raymond said in a statement. The finding strengthens the case for the presence of near-surface water ice on other bodies in the main asteroid belt, Prettyman said. Information collected by Dawn showed that Ceres, unlike Vesta, has been using water to create minerals. Scientists combine mineralogical data with computer models to learn about its interior. \"Liquid water had to be in the interior of Ceres in order for us to see what's on the surface,\" Prettyman told a news conference at the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-ceres-idUSKBN1442Z2"}, {"title": "Hunt for water at Ceres goes underground", "date": "2016-12-23", "content": "NASA's Dawn spacecraft has continued its survey of the dwarf planet Ceres this year, discovering rock-bound ice hidden just beneath the airless world's rugged surface and a handful of icy outcrops inside craters in the northern hemisphere, raising hopes that Ceres could have once held a buried habitable ocean of liquid water. Dawn does not carry instruments to probe for water deep underground, but the mission's examination of Ceres's surface properties point to a watery presence at some point in the dwarf planet's history. \"Liquid water had to be in the interior of Ceres in order for us to see the mineralology that's on the surface - the phyllosilicates - and also the concentration of the hydrogen that we see in the equator that's presumed to be ice-free,\" said Thomas Prettyman, lead scientist on Dawn's Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector, or GRAND, instrument from the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona. \"So Ceres's surface, the fact that it's ice-rich, and that there are alteration products on the surface, means that at some point in time there was liquid water,\" Prettyman said in a Dec. 15 press conference at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting in San Francisco. Circling around the sun inside the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, Ceres formed from a collection of pebbles and dust in the proto- solar system around 4.5 billion years ago, likely farther from the sun thats its current location, giving it a heritage closer to the moons of the outer solar system than most asteroids. \"We're interested in what was happening right after Ceres accreted, and we're mostly interested in whether the water and volatiles separated from the granular material, created a subsurface ocean, and the water and rock interacted in ways that would have produced a chemical environment which would have been conducive to life, a habitable environment,\" said Carol Raymond, the Dawn mission's deputy principal investigator from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Ceres likely lost its supposed liquid ocean more than 2 billion years ago, Raymond said. Before that point, Ceres might have been much like Jupiter's moon Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus, two hot spots in the ongoing search for microbial life in the solar system. If an ocean was under Ceres's surface, it froze as the dwarf planet cooled billions of years ago, when its internal natural radioactive heating source decayed. Europa and Enceladus are subjected to tidal heating from the strong gravitational pull from Jupiter and Saturn, and thus retain their liquid oceans today. \"When Ceres froze out would have been likely fairly early on ... within a couple billion years of its accretion, so before the freezing part, if there was substantial water-rock fractionation, and there was a substantial water ocean, then all of these chemical processes that were occurring that were creating the phyllosilicates we see would have provided the energy and the environment that would have been conducive to life,\" Raymond said. \"So I think it's pointing toward Ceres being an interesting object, mostly equivalent to Europa or Enceladus in terms of its habitability potential.\" According to Prettyman, data from his team's instrument show Ceres harbours a vast global reservoir of hydrogen, which scientists infer to be water, 100 times more than the hydrogen found at Vesta, a rocky asteroid visited by Dawn earlier in its mission. Near the equator, the water seems to be bound to rocks, forming \"hydrated\" minerals likely embedded with organic molecules, Prettyman said. At higher latitudes, the hydrogen signal is stronger, consistent with large masses of water ice lurking just below the surface, perhaps as shallow as a few feet in some regions. Dawn's GRAND instrument works by collecting gamma rays and neutrons generated when galactic cosmic rays, which constantly stream into the solar system from interstellar space and strike Ceres's surface. The incoming radiation strips neutrons from their atomic nuclei, then the neutrons produce gamma rays as a byproduct of nuclear reactions. \"The neutron emissions are sensitive to light elements like hydrogen and carbon that are in the surface,\" Prettyman said. \"The neutrons also undergo nuclear reactions and make gamma rays, and the gamma rays provide a fingerprint of what's in the surface. You can kind of imagine that there's a specific gamma ray energy that's associated with a particular nuclear reaction. You know that energy, and you can identify the element that was struck by the neutron.\" Some water ice is even exposed on Ceres's surface. High-contrast, brightened images from Dawn's German-built framing camera have helped scientists locate markings inside dark craters near the dwarf planet's north pole. The mission's Italian-built visible and infrared mapping spectrometer has determined at least one of the bright deposits is water ice, according to Norbert Schorghofer, a Dawn mission scientist from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Dawn's science team has identified more than 600 \"persistently shadowed regions\" on Ceres, almost all at the bottoms of craters in the northern hemisphere, Schorghofer said. These locations never see sunlight throughout Ceres's nine-hour day, even during the northern summer. Brightened imagery showing the dark shadowed regions have revealed 10 have bright deposits, and one has an outcrop extending into sunlight, allowing Dawn's spectrometer to measure the feature's chemical composition, which turned out to be water ice. Schorghofer said scientists assume the bright markings inside other shadowy craters are also made of water ice, which is able to survive on the surface in certain locations because the persistently shadowed regions are extremely cold, less than minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit, preventing the ice from turning into vapor and escaping. These \"cold traps\" are similar to dark crater floors at the poles of Mercury and Earth's moon. \"What's common among these three airless bodies is that they all have very little seasonality, and a crater near the poles doesn't see sunlight,\" said Schorghofer, co-author of a paper describing the persistently shadowed craters in the journal Nature Astronomy. \"Ceres helps us put the cold traps of Mercury and the moon in context. \"On Mercury, the cold traps are basically filled with ice,\" Schorghofer said. \"On the moon, the situation is very complex. There doesn't seem to be much exposed ice at least. On Ceres, there is ice in at least some cold traps.\" Dawn's spectrometer has also found probable water ice inside Oxo crater, a small sunlit impact basin at Ceres's mid-latitudes. \"There is lots of ice beneath the surface, very close to the surface, but it's rare on the surface,\" Schorghofer said. \"Subsurface ice is ubiquitous on Ceres. Exposed ice is rare.\" Scientists are still studying how the water molecules ended up in Ceres's northern crater floors. Europe's Herschel space telescope detected water vapor at Ceres in 2012 and 2013, a finding that might mean the icy world supports a tenuous atmosphere. Dawn's GRAND instrument has also returned data suggestive of an ultra-thin atmosphere, which would help explain how water could be transported around the dwarf planet, and fall into the cold traps. \"If, for whatever reason, there is a water molecule on the surface, it will undergo these giant hops, which take over an hour, and a fraction of them will just happen to fall into these cold traps,\" Schorghofer said. \"We think that's how the ice accumulates.\" Some scientists hoped to find more extensive ice at Ceres's surface, and were initially buoyed by the discovery of large bright spots inside several craters, most prominently the Occator crater, that turned out to be salt deposits. The signature of carbonates, a type of salt, inside the 57-mile-wide Occator crater has left experts trying to learn how the deposits got there. Ralf Jaumann, a planetary scientist and Dawn co-investigator from Germany's DLR space agency, said one leading theory are that the impactor that excavated Occator created a pool of melted rock and water, an impact-driven hydrothermal system that separated different chemicals in the aftermath of the cosmic smash, leaving behind the salt slabs at the surface. \"Another idea is that we have material beneath the surface, which has been released by the impact itself,\" Jaumann said. \"So the impact triggered cryovolcanic activity. There's an open debate about this. It's not clear how this works. There still may be water underneath the bright salty features in Occator, which have been named Cerealia Facula and Vinalia Faculae. The central deposit has a fractured salt dome. \"I'm pretty sure that there's also water in Occator in the subsurface,\" Jaumann said. \"The problem we have is all of our instruments are not able to penetrate the surface. We just get the first millimeters of the surface in our data.\" A mountain on another part of Ceres, named Ahuna Mons, is an example of a more recent cryovolcano. The peak, towering more than 15,000 feet above nearby terrain, is no longer erupting, but scientists believe it only went dormant in a relatively recent era of geologic history, perhaps as little as a few hundred million years ago. Ahuna Mons likely spewed out a mixture of water, salt and mud that flowed down its slopes. The geologic activity ... does tell us that there are likely some liquids in the subsurface,\" Raymond said. \"Whether we have water is unclear because what we would expect is briny fluid. They have a much lower melting temperature than water, so the water likely is sequestered in the ice deposits near the surface, and if there are fluids, they mostly likely are very brine- rich fluids and they would account, for instance, the Ahuna Mons features that is interpreted to be a cryovolcano.\" NASA approved funding for Dawn to continue its exploration of Ceres earlier this year, opting to keep the spacecraft in orbit around the dwarf planet instead of sending the probe on a flyby of asteroid Adeona, a main-belt asteroid believed to be a primitive, carbon-rich body left over from the earliest history of the solar system. Dawn is now monitoring Ceres for any changes as the dwarf planet, which is the largest object in the asteroid belt, nears perihelion, the closest point to the sun in its orbit. The spacecraft launched in September 2007, and was the first probe to orbit two extraterrestrial worlds - Vesta and Ceres - using highly-efficient ion thrusters to bend its trajectory through the solar system. Dawn arrived at Ceres in early 2015 and is now orbiting about more than 4,500 miles above Ceres after raising its altitude to conserve fuel. Two of the spacecraft's four reaction wheels failed earlier in the mission, forcing engineers to improvise a \"hybrid\" system using the remaining wheels and hydrazine-fueled rocket thrusters to control Dawn's pointing for science observations and propulsive manoeuvres. The unexpected consumption of hydrazine led to estimates that the probe may run out of fuel soon after completing its primary mission at Ceres earlier this year, but Raymond said the two active reaction wheels, gyro-like devices which turn the spacecraft with momentum, remain healthy. \"The fact that they have survived means we've used about half the hydrazine we would have had to use without them,\" Raymond said, referring to the reaction wheels. \"That's one of the reasons why Dawn has continued to operate, and those wheels are doing fine. \"We're not using much fuel right now because we're farther away from Ceres, but as long as they survive, the prospects for continuing to operate are pretty good throughout the next year.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2016/12/23/hunt-for-water-at-ceres-goes-underground/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Lonely Ice Volcano On Ceres May Have Once Had Company", "date": "2017-02-03", "content": "The mystery of the dwarf planet Ceres' lonely ice volcano may have just been solved. NASA's Dawn probe discovered the 2.5-mile-high cryovolcano, named Ahuna Mons, in 2015. There's nothing else remotely like it on the 590-mile-wide Ceres - a fact that has had scientists scratching their heads. \"Imagine if there was just one volcano on all of Earth,\" Michael Sori, of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, said in a statement. \"That would be puzzling.\" Ahuna Mons could simply be a one-of-a-kind feature. But new research by Sori and his colleagues suggests another possible answer: Ahuna Mons may have once had company, older cryovolcanoes that flattened out and disappeared over the eons via a process called \"viscous relaxation.\" Viscous relaxation means that many solids on a planetary surface will flow, given enough time. Earth's mountains don't relax in an appreciable way, because they're made of rock. But Ahuna Mons has a lot of water ice mixed in and is therefore a relaxation candidate, Sori said. So Sori and his colleagues used computer simulations to model how Ahuna Mons would relax over time. They found that such relaxation would occur only if the cryovolcano were made of at least 40 percent water ice. At this composition, Ahuna Mons should be flattening out at the rate of about 33 feet to 165 feet per 1 million years, the researchers report in a new study, which has been accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Such a relaxation rate is sufficient to wipe out a large Ceres cryovolcano in hundreds of millions to a few billion years. So it's possible that Ahuna Mons once had older brothers and sisters, which have since vanished into Ceres' frigid surface, Sori said. \"Ahuna Mons is at most 200 million years old,\" Sori said. \"It just hasn't had time to deform.\" Sori and his team plan to search for signs of Ceres' lost cryovolcanoes in other images captured by Dawn. The probe has been studying Ceres - the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter - from orbit since March 2015. Such work could inform scientists' understanding of cryovolcanoes throughout the solar system, said Kelsi Singer, a postdoctoral researcher at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who was not involved with the new study. \"It would be fun to check some of the other features that are potentially older domes on Ceres to see if they fit in with the theory of how the shapes should viscously evolve over time,\" Singer said in the same statement. \"Because all of the putative cryovolcanic features on other worlds are different, I think this helps to expand our inventory of what is possible.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/35571-ceres-ice-volcano-ahuna-mons.html"}, {"title": "Dwarf planet Ceres boasts organic compounds, raising prospect of life", "date": "2017-02-16", "content": "A NASA spacecraft has detected carbon-based materials, similar to what may have been the building blocks for life on Earth, on the Texas-sized dwarf planet Ceres that orbits between Mars and Jupiter in the main asteroid belt, scientists said on Thursday. The finding puts Ceres, a rock-and-ice world about 590 miles in diameter, on a growing list of places in the solar system of interest to scientists looking for life beyond Earth. The list includes Mars and several ocean-bearing moons of Jupiter and Saturn. The discovery, published in the journal Science, was made by a team of researchers using NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which has been orbiting Ceres for nearly two years. \"I think these organic molecules are a long way from microbial life,\" Dawn lead scientist Christopher Russell of the University of California Los Angeles wrote in an email to Reuters. \"However, this discovery tells us that we need to explore Ceres further.\" Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt and is located about three times farther from the sun than Earth. The composition of Ceres is thought to reflect the material present in parts of the solar system when it was forming some 4-1/2 billion years ago. \"The discovery indicates that the starting material in the solar system contained the essential elements, or the building blocks, for life,\" Russell said. \"Ceres may have been able to take this process only so far. Perhaps to move further along the path took a larger body with more complex structure and dynamics,\" like Earth, Russell added. The organic material was found near a 31-mile-wide crater in Ceres' northern hemisphere. Although the exact molecular compounds in the organics could not be identified, they matched tar-like minerals, such as kerite or asphaltite, the scientists wrote. \"Because Ceres is a dwarf planet that may still preserve internal heat from its formation period and may even contain a subsurface ocean, this opens the possibility that primitive life could have developed on Ceres itself,\" planetary scientist Michael Kuppers of the European Space Astronomy Center in Madrid wrote in an related essay in the journal Science. Based on the location and type of organics found on Ceres, scientists ruled out the possibility they were deposited by a crashing asteroid or comet. Lead researcher Maria Cristina De Sanctis of Italy's National Institute for Astrophysics and colleagues suspect the material formed inside Ceres through hydrothermal activity, though how the organics reached the surface remains a mystery.

On assignment from Earth at dwarf planet Ceres, Dawn is performing like the ace flier that it is. The spacecraft's activities are part of an ambitious bonus goal the team has recently devised for the extended mission. Dawn will maneuver to a location exactly on the line connecting Ceres and the sun and take pictures and spectra there. Measuring the opposition surge we explained last month will help scientists gain insight into the microscopic nature of the famous bright material in Occator Crater. Flying to that special position and acquiring the pictures and spectra will consume most of the rest of the extended mission, which concludes on June 30. This month, we will look at the probe's intricate maneuvers. Next month, we will delve more into the opposition surge itself, and in April we will describe Dawn's detailed plans for photography and spectroscopy. In May we will discuss further maneuvers that could provide a backup opportunity for observing the opposition surge in June. First, however, it is worth recalling that this is not Dawn's primary responsibility, which is to continue to measure cosmic rays in order to improve scientists' ability to establish the atomic species down to about a yard underground. Sensing the space radiation requires the spacecraft to stay more than 4,500 miles above the dwarf planet that is its gravitational master. The gamma ray and neutron detector will be operated continuously as Dawn changes its orbit and then performs the new observations. The ongoing high-priority radiation measurements will not be affected by the new plans. The principal objective of the orbital maneuvers is to swivel Dawn's orbit around Ceres. Imagine looking down on Ceres' north pole, with the sun far to the left. from last month. As we will explain in May, Dawn's orbital plane is slowly rotating clockwise, according to plan, and it is now even closer to vertical than depicted in January. That does not affect the following discussion.) From your perspective, looking edge-on at Dawn's orbit, its elliptical path looks like a line, just as does a coin seen from the edge. In its current orbit, Dawn moves from the bottom to the top over the north pole. When it is over the south pole, on the other side of the orbit, it flies from the top of the figure back to the bottom. The purpose of the current maneuvering is to make Dawn travel instead from the left to the right over the north pole. This is equivalent to rotating the plane of the orbit around the axis that extends through Ceres' poles and up to Dawn's altitude. From the sun's perspective, Dawn starts by revolving counterclockwise and the orbit is face-on. We want to turn it so it is edge-on to the sun. That may not sound very difficult. After all, it amounts mostly to turning right at the north pole or left at the south pole. Spaceships in science fiction do that all the time. However, it turns out to be extremely difficult in reality, not to mention lacking the cool sounds. When going over the south pole, from the top of the figure to the bottom, the spacecraft has momentum in that direction. To turn, it needs to cancel that out and then develop momentum to the left. That requires a great deal of work. It is energetically expensive. Fortunately, the ever-resourceful flight team has an affordable way. As we discuss this more, we will present three diagrams of the trajectory. It may be challenging to follow Dawn's three-dimensional motion on two- dimensional figures, especially if you are not accustomed to reading such depictions. Don't worry! The team has it all under control, and it works. But consider that however complicated the figures seem, designing and flying the maneuvers is somewhat more complicated. Nevertheless, if you want to try, it might help to try to reproduce Dawn's movements with your finger as you read the text and study the illustrations. Suppose you are driving from north to south and want to turn east at an intersection. You have to decrease your southward velocity somehow; otherwise, you will continue moving in that direction. You also have to increase your eastward velocity, which initially is zero. That means putting on the brakes and then turning the wheel and reaccelerating, which takes work. With your car, there are two major forces at work: the engine and the friction between the wheels and the road. For a spacecraft, the forces available are the propulsion system and the gravity of other bodies. Ceres' only moon is Dawn itself, and there are no other helpful gravitational forces, so it's all up to the probe's ion engine. Dawn was not built to perform these new maneuvers. The main tank and the xenon propellant loaded in it shortly before the spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral did not account for such an addition to the interplanetary itinerary. The plan was to travel from Earth past Mars to Vesta, enter orbit and maneuver around the protoplanet, then break out of orbit and travel to Ceres, slip into orbit, and maneuver there. Dawn has now done all that with great distinction and already moved around more while orbiting Ceres than originally planned. Indeed, the mission has accomplished far, far more propulsive flight than any other, but now its xenon supply is very low. Navigators needed an efficient way to swivel the spacecraft's orbit, and that meant finding an efficient way to change the direction of its orbital motion. An orbit is the perfect balance between the inward tug of gravity and the fundamental tendency of free objects to travel in a straight line. Orbital velocity thus depends on the strength of the gravitational pull. At low altitude, orbiting objects travel faster than at higher altitude., including with examples, several times before. Dawn is flying to a very high altitude, where Ceres' grip will not be as strong so the orbital velocity will naturally be much lower and therefore easier to change. Then it will turn left and swoop back down for the photo op. Any hotshot spaceship pilot would be proud to fly the same profile. In December 2016, Dawn reached extended mission orbit 3, which ranged in altitude between 4,670 miles and 5,810 miles. Now the spacecraft is climbing, and it will peak at more than 32,000 miles in early April when it will pivot the orbit almost 90 degrees. It will then glide down to about 12,400 miles for the targeted observations. The maneuvering will be conducted in four stages. The first part of the ion powered ascent was Feb. 22-26, and the next will be March 8-12 when the orbital position is optimal. Although the spacecraft will stop thrusting then at an altitude of 8,000 miles, it will have built up so much momentum that it will continue soaring upward for almost a month as Ceres' gravitational attraction slows its down. A third period of thrusting on April 3-14 at the apex of its arc will accomplish the turn. Dawn will then be in an orbit that will intersect the line between Occator Crater and the sun on April 29. This complex flight plan is different from all the prior powered flight, both at Vesta and at Ceres. Most of the orbit changes have been lovely spirals, and the ship rode the gravitational currents at Vesta to shift the orbital plane by a much smaller angle than it is working on now. Some of the graceful steps in this new choreography are especially delicate and require exquisite accuracy to reach just the right final trajectory. For the first time in almost two years, the spacecraft will need to take pictures of Ceres for the express purpose of helping navigators plot its progress. Combining these \" optical navigation \" pictures with their other navigational techniques, the team will design a final, fourth stage of ion thrusting for April 22-24 to fine tune the orbit. We have described such trajectory correction maneuvers before. By the time it began ion thrusting last week, Dawn had successfully completed all of its assignments in XMO3. That included three photography sessions. In the last, the spacecraft used the primary and backup cameras simultaneously for the first time in the entire mission. In its extensive investigations of Vesta and Ceres, Dawn has taken more than 85,000 pictures, but all of them had been with only one camera powered on at a time, the other being held in reserve. In April we will discuss the reason for operating differently before leaving XMO3. Dawn's adventure has been long and its experiences manifold. In just a few days, the bold explorer will mark its second anniversary of arriving at Ceres. In 2011-2012, the probe spent almost 14 months in orbit around the giant protoplanet Vesta, the second largest object in the main asteroid belt. The only craft ever to orbit two alien destinations, it is a denizen of deep space. In its nearly 9.5-year solar system journey, Dawn has traveled 3.7 billion miles. For most of this time, the spaceship has been in orbit around the sun, just as its erstwhile home Earth is. Now it has been in orbit around remote worlds for a third of its total time in space. And for you numerologists, March 5 will mark Dawn's being in orbit around its targets for pi years. Readers on or near Earth who appreciate following such an extraordinary extraterrestrial expedition can take advantage of an opportunity this week to do a little celestial navigation of their own. On March 2, the moon will serve as a helpful signpost to locate the faraway ship on the interplanetary seas. From our terrestrial viewpoint, the moon will move very close to Dawn's location in the sky. The specifics, of course, depend on your exact location. For many afternoon sky watchers in North America, the moon will come to within about a degree, or two lunar diameters, of Dawn. As viewed by some observers in South America, the moon will pass directly in front of Dawn. For most Earthlings, when the moon rises on the morning of March 2, it will be north and east of Dawn. During the day, the moon will gradually drift closer and, from many locations, pass the spacecraft and the dwarf planet it orbits. The angle separating them will be less than the width of your palm at arm's length, providing a handy way to find our planet's emissary. Although Dawn and Ceres will appear to be near the moon, they will not be close to it at all. The distant spacecraft will be more than 1,300 times farther away than the moon by then and quite invisible. But your correspondent invites you to gaze in that direction as you raise a saluting hand to humankind's insatiable appetite for knowledge, irresistible drive for exploration, passion for adventure, and longing to know the cosmos. Dawn is 7,300 miles from Ceres. It is also 3.19 AU from Earth, or 1,280 times as far as the moon and 3.22 times as far as the sun today.

By electrically changing the speed at which these gyroscope-like devices spin, Dawn controls its orientation in the zero-gravity, frictionless conditions of space. The team discovered the situation during a scheduled communications session on April 24, diagnosed the problem, and returned the spacecraft to its standard flight configuration, still with hydrazine control, on April 25. The failure occurred after Dawn completed its five-hour segment of ion thrusting on April 22 to adjust its orbit, but before the shorter manoeuvre scheduled for April 23-24. The orbit will still allow Dawn to perform its opposition measurements. The spacecraft is outfitted with four reaction wheels.

This movie shows these opposition images, with contrast enhanced to highlight brightness differences. The bright spots of Occator stand out particularly well on an otherwise relatively bland surface. Dawn took these images from an altitude of about 12,000 miles.

Even as the veteran explorer orbits high over dwarf planet Ceres and looks forward to continuing its mission, today it can reflect upon 10 exciting and productive years. The ambitious adventurer embarked on an extraordinary extraterrestrial expedition on Sept. 27, 2007. With its advanced ion propulsion system, Dawn soared past Mars in 2009. The spacecraft took some of the Red Planet's orbital energy around the sun to boost itself on its journey. Ever a responsible citizen of the cosmos, Dawn fully adheres to the principle of the conservation of energy. So to compensate for speeding up, it slowed Mars down. In 2011, the spacecraft arrived at Vesta, the second largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Dawn gracefully entered into Vesta's firm but gentle gravitational embrace. The probe maneuvered extensively in orbit, optimizing its views to get the best return possible from its photography and other observations. During 14 months in orbit, Dawn completed 1,298 revolutions around Vesta, taking nearly 31,000 pictures and collecting a wealth of other scientific measurements. From the perspective it had then, Dawn was in residence for nearly a third of a Vestan year. The explorer revealed a strange, ancient protoplanet, now recognized to be more closely related to the terrestrial planets than to the typical and smaller asteroids. Unlike all other deep-space missions, Dawn had the capability to leave its first orbital destination and voyage to and enter orbit around another. After smoothly disengaging from Vesta, the interplanetary spaceship flew more than 900 million miles in 2.5 years to Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt. Indeed, prior to Dawn's arrival, that dwarf planet was the largest body between the sun and dwarf planet Pluto that a spacecraft had not yet visited. And just as at Vesta, thanks to the maneuverability of ion propulsion, Dawn did not have to be content with a one- time flyby, gathering only as much data as possible during a brief encounter. By going into orbit around Ceres, the spacecraft could linger to scrutinize the exotic, alien world. And that is exactly what it has done. Both Vesta and Ceres have held secrets since the dawn of the solar system, and both have beckoned since they were first spotted in telescopes at the dawn of the 19th century. For the next two centuries, they appeared as little more than faint smudges of light amidst myriad glittering stellar jewels, waiting for an inquisitive and admiring visitor from Earth. Finally, Dawn answered their cosmic invitations and eventually developed richly detailed, intimate portraits of each. As the last stop on a unique interplanetary journey of discovery, Ceres has proven well worth the wait. Since arriving in March 2015, Dawn has completed 1,595 revolutions. It has beheld mysterious and fascinating landscapes and unveiled a complex world of rock, ice and salt, along with organic compounds and other intriguing constituents. The dwarf planet may have been covered by an ocean long ago, and there might even be liquid water underground now. The 57,000 pictures and numerous other measurements with the sophisticated sensors will keep scientists busy for many years. By early 2016, during its ninth year in space, Dawn had accomplished so much that it exceeded all of the original objectives established for it by NASA before the ship set sail. Along the way, Dawn encountered and ultimately overcame many obstacles, including equipment failures that could well have sunk the mission. Against all odds and expectations, however, when its prime mission concluded in June 2016, the spacecraft was still healthy enough that NASA decided to extend the mission to learn still more about Ceres. Since then, Dawn has conducted many investigations that had never even been considered prior to last year. Now it has successfully achieved all of the extended mission objectives. And, once again defying predictions thanks to expert piloting by the flight team, Dawn still has some life left in it. Before the end of the year, NASA will formulate another new set of objectives that will take it to the end of its operational life. Dawn has flown to many different orbital altitudes and orientations to examine Ceres. Now the probe is in an elliptical orbit, ranging from less than 3,200 miles up to 23,800 miles. At these heights, it is measuring cosmic rays. Scientists mathematically remove the cosmic ray noise from Dawn's 2015-2016 recordings of atomic elements from a low, tight orbit at only 240 miles. In its present orbit, Dawn can make these measurements to clarify Ceres' nuclear signals while being very frugal with its precious hydrazine, which is so crucial because of the loss of three reaction wheels. When the hydrazine is expended, the mission will end. So this high elliptical orbit is a very good place to be while NASA and the Dawn project are determining how best to use the spacecraft in the future. Meanwhile, this anniversary presents a convenient opportunity to look back on a remarkable spaceflight. For those who would like to track the probe's progress in the same terms used on past anniversaries, we present here the tenth annual summary, reusing text from previous years with updates where appropriate. Readers who wish to investigate Dawn's ambitious journey in detail may find it helpful to compare this material with the Dawn Journals from its first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth anniversaries. In its 10 years of interplanetary travels, the spacecraft has thrust with its ion engines for a total of 2,109 days, or 58 percent of the time. While for most spacecraft, firing a thruster to change course is a special event, it is Dawn's wont. All this thrusting has cost the craft only 908 pounds of its supply of xenon propellant, which was 937 pounds on Sept. 27, 2007. The spacecraft has used 69 of the 71 gallons of xenon it carried when it rode its rocket from Earth into space. The thrusting since then has achieved the equivalent of accelerating the probe by 25,400 mph. As previous logs have described for one of the more extensive discussions, because of the principles of motion for orbital flight, whether around the sun or any other gravitating body, Dawn is not actually traveling this much faster than when it launched. But the effective change in speed remains a useful measure of the effect of any spacecraft's propulsive work. Dawn has far exceeded the velocity change achieved by any other spacecraft under its own power. It is remarkable that Dawn's ion propulsion system has provided nearly the same change in speed as the entire Delta rocket. Since launch, our readers who have remained on or near Earth have completed 10 revolutions around the sun, covering 62.8 AU. Orbiting farther from the sun, and thus moving at a more leisurely pace, Dawn has traveled 42.4 AU. As it climbed away from the sun, up the solar system hill to match its orbit to that of Vesta, it continued to slow down to Vesta's speed. It had to go even slower to perform its graceful rendezvous with Ceres. In the 10 years since Dawn began its voyage, Vesta has traveled only 40.5 AU, and the even more sedate Ceres has gone 37.8 AU. Another way to investigate the progress of the mission is to chart how Dawn's orbit around the sun has changed. This discussion will culminate with even more numbers than we usually include, and readers who prefer not to indulge may skip this material, leaving that much more for the grateful Numerivores. In order to make the table below comprehensible, we recycle some more text here on the nature of orbits. Orbits are ellipses. So as members of the solar system family follow their individual paths around the sun, they sometimes move closer and sometimes move farther from it. In addition to orbits being characterized by shape, or equivalently by the amount of flattening, and by size, they may be described in part by how they are oriented in space. Using the bias of terrestrial astronomers, the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun is a good reference. Other planets and interplanetary spacecraft may travel in orbits that are tipped at some angle to that. The angle between the ecliptic and the plane of another body's orbit around the sun is the inclination of that orbit. Vesta and Ceres do not orbit the sun in the same plane that Earth does, and Dawn must match its orbit to that of its targets. Now we can see how Dawn has done by considering the size and shape and inclination of its orbit on each of its anniversaries. The table below shows what the orbit would have been if the spacecraft had terminated ion thrusting on its anniversaries; the orbits of its destinations, Vesta and Ceres, are included for comparison. Of course, when Dawn was on the launch pad on Sept. 27, 2007, its orbit around the sun was exactly Earth's orbit. After launch, it was in its own solar orbit. For readers who are not overwhelmed by the number of numbers, investing the effort to study the table may help to demonstrate how Dawn patiently transformed its orbit during the course of its mission. Note that six years ago, the spacecraft's path around the sun was exactly the same as Vesta's. Achieving that perfect match was, of course, the objective of the long flight that started in the same solar orbit as Earth, and that is how Dawn managed to slip into orbit around Vesta. While simply flying by it would have been far easier, matching orbits with Vesta required the exceptional capability of the ion propulsion system. Without that technology, NASA's Discovery Program would not have been able to afford a mission to explore the massive protoplanet in such detail. Dawn has long since gone well beyond that. Having discovered so many of Vesta's secrets, the adventurer left it behind. No other spacecraft has ever escaped from orbit around one distant solar system object to travel to and orbit still another extraterrestrial destination. From 2012 to 2015, the stalwart craft reshaped and tilted its orbit even more so that now it is identical to Ceres'. Once again, that was essential to accomplishing the intricate celestial choreography in which the behemoth reached out with its gravity and tenderly took hold of the spacecraft. They have been performing an elegant pas de deux ever since. Even after a decade of daring space travel, flying in deep space atop a blue- green pillar of xenon ions, exploring two of the last uncharted worlds in the inner solar system, overcoming the loss of three reaction wheels, working hard to stretch its shrinking supply of hydrazine, Dawn is ready for more. And so is everyone who yearns for new knowledge, everyone who is curious about the cosmos, and everyone who is exhilarated by bold adventures into the unknown. More is to come. Dawn -- and all those who find the lure of space irresistible -- can look forward to whatever lies ahead for this unique mission. Dawn is 16,600 miles from Ceres. It is also 2.92 AU from Earth, or 1,080 times as far as the moon and 2.91 times as far as the sun today. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, take 49 minutes to make the round trip.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2017/9/dear-dawnniversaries"}, {"title": "Happy Anniversary, Dawn! Record-Setting NASA Probe Marks 10 Years in Space", "date": "2017-09-29", "content": "NASA's Dawn spacecraft has now been exploring the final frontier for a decade. Dawn launched on Sept. 27, 2007, kicking off a $467 million mission to study the two largest objects in the asteroid belt - the protoplanet Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres - up close. Vesta and Ceres are considered leftovers from the planet-formation period, so Dawn's work is designed to shed light on the solar system's early days. The probe has done all that was asked of it and more, mission team members said. \"Our interplanetary spaceship has exceeded all expectations in the last decade, delivering amazing insights about these two fascinating bodies,\" Dawn principal investigator Chris Russell, of UCLA, said in a statement. Dawn arrived at Vesta in July 2011 and circled the 330-mile-wide object for 14 months. The spacecraft's observations revealed, among other things, that Vesta's giant Rheasilvia Crater is even bigger than scientists had thought, with a diameter of 310 miles and a depth of 12 miles. And, if those dimensions weren't extreme enough for you, a mountain twice the height of Mount Everest rises from Rheasilvia's center. In September 2012, Dawn departed Vesta for the 590-mile-wide Ceres, the closest dwarf planet to the sun. The spacecraft arrived in March 2015, in the process becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit two different bodies beyond the Earth-moon system, and the first to circle a dwarf planet. Dawn has been studying Ceres from orbit ever since. This work has led to some surprising and intriguing discoveries. For example, Dawn has spotted mysterious bright deposits in multiple locations on Ceres - most notably, at the bottom of the dwarf planet's 57-mile-wide Occator Crater. Dawn also discovered the \"lonely mountain\" Ahuna Mons, an apparent ice volcano that towers 3 miles above the rest of Ceres' cratered landscape. \"Though both Ahuna Mons and Occator appear dormant, they suggest that liquid water flowed once beneath the surface of Ceres, and may even still be there today, if it is enriched in salts that would lower its freezing point,\" NASA officials wrote in the same statement. Three of Dawn's four orientation-maintaining reaction wheels have failed during the probe's time in space. But the mission team has powered through this issue, instead controlling Dawn's orientation using its hydrazine thrusters. Indeed, the spacecraft remains healthy overall, and is continuing to gather data from its 30-Earth-day-long elliptical orbit of Ceres, NASA officials said. \"This continues to be a mission for everyone who yearns for new knowledge, everyone who is curious about the cosmos, and everyone who is exhilarated by bold adventures into the unknown,\" said Marc Rayman, Dawn mission director and chief engineer, who's based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The Virginia-based company Orbital ATK designed and built Dawn, and JPL manages the spacecraft's mission.

The extension, announced by the agency Oct. 19, means that the spacecraft will not leave orbit around Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt, to visit another asteroid, an option project scientists said earlier this year was under consideration. The latest extension, the agency said, could allow the spacecraft to make high-resolution observations of Ceres. The mission team is studying options to place Dawn into an elliptical orbit that would bring it within 200 kilometers of the surface of Ceres. Previously, the spacecraft came no closer than 385 kilometers. Those close approaches, NASA said in a statement, would allow better measurements of the uppermost layer of the dwarf planet's surface using the spacecraft's gamma ray and neutron spectrometer, including determining how much ice it contains. Dawn will also collect high-resolution images and spectra on those close approaches. Dawn's lifetime is limited by its supply of hydrazine fuel, which the spacecraft has to expend for attitude control after the failure of three of the spacecraft's four reaction wheels. Dawn's current orbit, which keeps the spacecraft between 5,100 and 38,300 kilometers above Ceres, allows it to be \"very frugal with its precious hydrazine,\" said Marc Rayman, chief engineer for the mission, in a Sept. 27 statement. \"When the hydrazine is expended, the mission will end.\" With the proposed shift to a lower orbit, Dawn will expend more hydrazine. The spacecraft should be able to operate until some time in the second half of 2018. That will allow observations of Ceres as it passes perihelion, the closest point in its orbit to the sun, in April 2018. This extension, though, rules out proposals to send Dawn out of orbit to another asteroid. Project officials proposed such an extended mission in the senior review of planetary science missions in 2016, which would have sent Dawn on a flyby of the asteroid Adeona in 2019. NASA rejected that proposal, concluding that Dawn would provide more science by remaining in orbit around Ceres. As that initial extended mission came to an end in June, project officials again suggested they were considering a proposal to send Dawn to another asteroid. \"It's an option,\" Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator for Dawn at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at a June 13 meeting of NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group. She didn't provide additional details about that option. Dawn, part of NASA's Discovery program of low-cost planetary science missions, launched in September 2007. Using an ion propulsion system, it entered orbit around the main belt asteroid Vesta in July 2011, remaining in orbit there before leaving for Ceres, arriving there in March 2015. NASA said the extended mission will be designed so that, when Dawn depletes its hydrazine, it will be in a stable orbit around Ceres with no risk of crashing into the dwarf planet.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/dawn-to-spend-rest-of-its-mission-at-ceres/"}, {"title": "Dawn Spacecraft Will Remain at Dwarf Planet Ceres Until It Runs Out of Fuel", "date": "2017-10-24", "content": "NASA officials have decided that the Dawn spacecraft will spend its last days studying the dwarf planet Ceres. Rather than move on to another target for its final hurrah, Dawn will remain at Ceres until it runs out of fuel, which should happen around the middle of 2018. The decision grants Dawn a second extended mission, during which the spacecraft will dip down to an altitude of just 120 miles above the surface of Ceres, according to a statement from NASA. This will be the closest that the probe has ever come to Ceres, having previously reached a low altitude of 240 miles. The mission will continue until Dawn uses up the last of its hydrazine fuel, which is used to change the spacecraft's orientation. Dawn is expected to continue operating \"until the second half of 2018,\" according to the statement, but the exact date will depend on what activities the mission team decides to execute. \"How quickly we will use the hydrazine will depend on details of the observations that we have not yet designed, so we do not have a precise time frame,\" Marc Rayman, the Dawn chief engineer and mission director, told Space.com in an email. \"When the last of the hydrazine is exhausted, the spacecraft will no longer be able to control its orientation, so it won't be able to point its solar arrays at the sun, its sensors at Ceres, nor its antenna at Earth. That will be the end of Dawn's operational life.\" Dawn began orbiting Ceres in March 2015. It is the only spacecraft to have orbited two celestial bodies, having looped around the large asteroid Vesta from 2011 to 2012. In 2016, NASA was considering a proposal to send Dawn to a third target in the asteroid belt. The northern hemisphere on the sunlit side of dwarf planet Ceres, seen by NASA's Dawn spacecraft in April 2015. These giant asteroids have remained largely unchanged since the birth of the early solar system, and studying them can help scientists better understand the evolution of the solar system and the conditions in which the planets formed, according to NASA. One of Dawn's primary avenues of investigation is to understand how much water is present on Ceres. The close flyby will allow one of the probe's instruments, called the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector, to produce a more detailed map of chemical elements on the surface of Ceres, including water, according to the statement. Ceres is approaching its closest position to the sun, and its close proximity to the star could help scientists test two hypotheses, according to the statement. The first is that water ice in Ceres' surface is warmed up and turned into vapor, which helps to create the thin atmosphere that was detected around the dwarf planet prior to Dawn's arrival, but which occasionally disappears. The second hypothesis is that water vapor contributing to the atmosphere could also be created by energetic particles \"interacting with ice in Ceres' shallow surface,\" officials said in the statement. Ground-based telescopes will also keep an eye on Ceres as it approaches its April 2018 perihelion, to assist in these investigations. \"I am really excited about the extension, and so is the entire team,\" Rayman said. \"Dawn has already revealed Ceres to be an exotic world of ice, rock and salt, with organic materials and other chemical constituents, and I am looking forward to more discoveries about its composition and its geology. After all, the benefit of having the capability to orbit a distant destination, rather than being limited to a brief glimpse during a flyby, is that we can linger to scrutinize it and uncover even more of the secrets it holds. I don't know what we'll find, and that is part of the process of science and the thrill of exploration.\" When Dawn finally runs out of fuel, it will remain in orbit around Ceres for at least 50 years. NASA's Planetary Protection Office required the mission planners to guarantee that the probe would not crash into Ceres' surface less than 20 years after arriving at the dwarf planet, according to the agency. This decision helps to ensure that any microscopic life-forms that piggybacked on Dawn from Earth will be killed by the space environment, and will not invade any potentially habitable environments on Ceres.

Since arriving at Ceres in 2015, Dawn has found organic compounds, water ice and unexpected bright spots. Mission engineers are deciding how to manoeuvre the craft to let it fly less than 200 kilometres above the surface during its extended mission. This should allow it to measure gamma rays and neutrons emanating from Ceres, to find out what its crust is made of and how much ice it has. By April 2018, Ceres will be at its closest to the sun. That could help Dawn confirm whether Ceres's orbit allows the sun's heat to evaporate its ice, creating a thin, fleeting atmosphere. With this latest extension, Dawn will keep doing science until it runs out of fuel and ceases to communicate with Earth. Even after that, it will remain in orbit instead of crash-landing, so that it doesn't contaminate Ceres with microbes that may have hitched a ride from Earth.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23631493-400-dawn-spacecraft-approved-to-spend-another-year-studying-ceres/"}, {"title": "Dwarf Planet Ceres May Have Had a Global Ocean in Ancient Past", "date": "2017-11-08", "content": "Nestled in the asteroid belt, the dwarf planet Ceres contains water-rich materials that suggest it once boasted a global ocean in its distant past. Now, two new studies from NASA's Dawn mission may reveal traces of an ancient ocean in the crust, with remnants left behind in the muddy mantle beneath. Scientists used the tug of gravity on NASA's Dawn spacecraft to track gravitational features across the dwarf planet Ceres. Combined with models of the evolution of the icy surfaces, these observations reveal an ocean mostly frozen into a strong but flexible crust, with a mud-rich inner layer that keeps things moving. Referring to the new research, Dawn project scientist Julie Castillo-Rogez told Space.com, \"The new papers modeled the relaxation of Ceres' surface morphology at the global scale and the resulting gravitational anomalies in order to get several important results.\" When Dawn arrived at Ceres in 2015, it found a mostly flat world with only a single mountain, Ahuna Mons, and craters that were smaller than anticipated and not very rich in geological features. Past researchers have hunted for an explanation for the mystery of the missing craters and the lack of mountains, and they have concluded that the planet's crust must be slowly relaxing, like honey poured onto a plate. But that research looked at only small parts of the planet. The new research examined the world on a larger scale, Castillo-Rogez said. The first paper by Anton Ermakov, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, tracked small changes in Dawn's orbit to determine what is going on beneath Ceres' surface. As the spacecraft orbited the tiny world, Ceres pulled at it. More massive regions tugged more sharply on the spacecraft, while less dense regions had less of an impact. This affected how long it took the signal to travel from the orbiter to the antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network back on Earth. \"The distribution of masses inside Ceres creates a gravity field,\" Ermakov told Space.com by email. \"The shape of the gravity field tells us about the mass distribution inside Ceres and thus helps us to constrain its composition.\" What Would It Be Like to Live on Ceres? By taking the gravitational measurements of the crust, Ermakov and his team found that the crust of Ceres is very close to the density of water, Castillo- Rogez said. The new data puts the crust thickness at only 25 miles. The researchers also confirmed that the planet's mantle is rocky - something she said was expected. Ermakov and the Dawn team found that the massive mountain and three of the craters are all associated with gravity anomalies. The crater Occator is best known for hosting the largest and brightest spot on Ceres, while Kerwan and Yalode are the two largest confirmed craters on the planet. The connection of the gravitational anomalies with the four features supports the idea that Ceres is geologically active now or was very recently. An animated view of Ceres' gravity field overlaid on the dwarf planet based on measurements by NASA's Dawn spacecraft in orbit around the dwarf planet. The team also found positive mass concentrations, or mascons, under the two largest basins. These mascons have been found on Earth's moon, Mars and Mercury. Researchers suspect that mascons on the moon came from a massive asteroid impact that changed the density of the lunar surface and its magnetic field. \"For Kerwan and Yalode, the shape of the gravity anomaly looks like a bullseye pattern, very similar to the gravitational signatures of lunar mascons,\" Ermakov said. The research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. Building on Ermakov's research, Roger Fu, a Dawn team member at Harvard University, examined the interior structure of the world. Ermakov and his team had demonstrated that the dwarf planet's crust was more like ice than water. But Fu's co-author and Dawn guest investigator Michael Bland of the U.S. Geological Survey had previously demonstrated that Ceres' crust is 1,000 times stronger than water ice, a finding Fu's new research confirmed. Like his fellow author, Fu examined the planet as a whole. He modeled how the planet's crust flows. Rather than a pure-ice crust, Fu found that Ceres' surface is likely to be a mixture of ice, salts and rock. He also determined that clathrate hydrates are likely to be a significant component of the crust. A clathrate hydrate is a cage of water molecules surrounding a gas molecule. \"Methane clathrates are only one of several different salt species that might be in the crust,\" Fu told Space.com. \"Even if it's there, it's still probably one of several co-existing phases.\" Castillo-Rogez describes clathrates as \"really the only option that makes sense.\" Based on the results, the researchers think that Ceres once had more pronounced surface features that have gradually smoothed out over time. According to Fu, with a rocky crust, \"the really wide plateaus and basins - think in terms of global topographic features, like the Ceres equivalents of the Tibetan plateau or the entire Atlantic Ocean basin - would be a lot taller or lower.\" But Ceres is mostly flat. \"The ice-salt-rock mixture crust means there isn't as much contrast between the high and low points,\" Fu said. The flattening of the mountains and the valleys means that the strong crust must rest on a softer layer, which Fu and his colleagues think contains liquid mixed with the rock below the crust. Castillo-Rogez describes this as \"salty mud or briny mud.\" The team thinks most of the ancient ocean that once covered Ceres has been bound up into the crust, with only ice, clathrate hydrates and salts left behind to reveal its existence. While most of the ocean is tied up in the crust, the soft mantle suggests that some of it may still remain liquid. The results are consistent with thermal models of Ceres published before Dawn arrived. Fu's research is published in the journal Earth and Planetary Sciences Letters.

A team led by Filippo Giacomo Carrozzo of Italy's Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali used data from a visible-infrared mapping spectrometer on board NASA's Dawn spacecraft to resolve uncertainties regarding the chemical composition of the dwarf planet, which is the largest object in the asteroid belt, orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. Previous research and data from Dawn had confirmed the presence of carbonates on the surface of the planet. These are a group of minerals that are extremely diverse and common on Earth, and a defining feature of sedimentary rock. The detection of carbonates on other planets is assumed to be evidence that liquid water was once present. Carrozzo and colleagues used the Dawn spectrometer data to better map the presence of carbonates. They did this by measuring absorption bands - wavelengths characteristic of particular compounds - to build a map of chemical distribution across the surface.{%recommended 1261%} In a paper published in the journal Science Advances, the team report that carbonates are ubiquitous on Ceres, with the most common variant by far being magnesium carbonate. However, the researchers also report the presence of sodium carbonates, particularly a compound called natrite. This was unexpected, because if Ceres was nothing more than a long-dead ball of rock then these compounds would have evaporated over the past tens of millions of years. Instead, they are present in kilometre-size areas, especially near impact craters with domes or mounds. Some of the craters, too, show possible floor fractures. The evidence leads the researchers to conclude that the sodium carbonates are possibly being pushed to the surface from below-ground by rising subsurface fluids. Carrozzo and his colleagues suggest therefore that the kilometre-wide patches formed only within the past few million years, and that the process of their gradual evaporation is still underway.

At its lowest point, the probe is only 22 miles up. In outer space, that's virtually skimming the ground. The photo shoot started June 9; so far, Dawn has taken \"hundreds\" of pictures, says Rayman, \"exotic alien landscapes, scenes truly otherworldly.\" The images are so new, NASA researchers \"haven't had time to analyze them yet,\" he says. \"But it's almost like we're seeing a different Ceres.\" Space scientists already knew Ceres was more than a drab dead rock. Dawn began orbiting the dwarf planet in March 2015; even before taking the close-ups, the spacecraft shot more than 50,000 images, all from hundreds or thousands of miles away. Researchers mapped the surface. They analyzed data from the rest of Dawn's instruments. They saw a cryovolcano, salt flats, and ancient Occator Crater, 57 miles across. They figured out that vast amounts of salt water, nearly all frozen, dwells underground. They also found organic materials-the \"building blocks\" for life. Indeed, the latest data shows lots of organics: \"One area of 3,700 acres, covered with it,\" says Rayman. \"Five to ten times more prevalent than we thought was there.\" Landslides along Occator Crater's eastern rim. Dawn's altitude: 27 miles. Still, Rayman- the chief engineer and mission director of the project -is skeptical that Ceres has life. \"It is an extreme remote possibility,\" he says. \"Ceres does have many of the ingredients we think are necessary for life-water, organics, a source of energy, internal geological forces. \"But you need to combine the ingredients in the right way.\" Ceres likely does not. Daytime surface temperature is minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Any atmosphere is barely there, transient at best. Even the most primitive of microbes are doubtful. The close-ups are the spacecraft's last hurrah; Dawn is nearly out of fuel. Less than two gallons of hydrazine are left. \"In this low-altitude orbit, we use the propellant much more quickly,\" says Rayman. \"So it's going fast.\" The hydrazine may last another few weeks, or a few months, but is surely gone sometime between August and October. When that happens, Dawn is dead. \"It won't be able to control its orientation, point its antenna to Earth, point its camera, or point the ion engine,\" Rayman says. Instead, Dawn will engage in an endless dance around Ceres, forever in orbit. Rayman, with the mission nearly 16 years, has \"bittersweet\" feelings. \"Dawn was powered by the burning desire to know the cosmos,\" he says. \"It's not just the ion propulsion that got us there.\" Yet research never stops. Generations of scientists will download the data from Dawn for decades to come. Says Rayman: \"The spacecraft won't continue. But its legacy will.\" Artist's impression. The Dawn spacecraft.

As posted by NASA on July 2, 2018, the new images being sent back are fantastic - high-resolution views of the rugged surface and in particular, the famous \"bright spots\" in Occator Crater and elsewhere. These spots, which stand out starkly against the darker background surface, have intrigued scientists and the public alike ever since they were first discovered by Dawn when it arrived at Ceres in 2015. Dawn reached its final, lowest orbit on June 6, and has been busy sending back thousands of images and other data about Ceres. This will help scientists to understand how Ceres formed and evolved over time, and how it appears to still be geologically active today, despite being so small compared to other planets. The newest images from Ceres have a resolution of less than 5 meters per pixel. As Dr. Andreas Nathues, Framing Camera Lead Investigator, said : The data exceeds all our expectations. The bright spots, now known to be composed of sodium carbonate, are one of the biggest clues as to current activity, and the new images and data will help to finally answer the question of how they got there. Dawn has now taken the closest-ever images of Cerealia Facula, the largest deposit in the center of Occator Crater, after firing its ion engine last week to adjust its orbit trajectory. According to Dawn's chief engineer and project manager, Marc Rayman, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California: Acquiring these spectacular pictures has been one of the greatest challenges in Dawn's extraordinary extraterrestrial expedition, and the results are better than we had ever hoped. Dawn is like a master artist, adding rich > details to the otherworldly beauty in its intimate portrait of Ceres. Dawn's new orbit now takes it to a distance of only 22 miles above Ceres' surface. Previously, the lowest orbit was 240 miles, so this is a big improvement for being able to see more details on the surface, including in the spots. The spots, evaporate deposits composed of sodium carbonate, are thought to be left over from when water came up to the surface from deeper below and then evaporated in the extremely tenuous and sporadic water vapor \"atmosphere.\" That water could be either from a shallow sub-surface reservoir or from a deeper reservoir of salty brines percolating upward through fractures. The deposits in Occator Crater are the largest and brightest of these deposits. As with many discoveries in planetary science, they were completely unexpected, and show that Ceres is not just an inert ball of rock and ice. As noted by Carol Raymond, the Dawn mission's principal investigator: The first views of Ceres obtained by Dawn beckoned us with a single, blinding bright spot. Unraveling the nature and history of this fascinating dwarf planet during the course of Dawn's extended stay at Ceres has been thrilling, and it is especially fitting that Dawn's last act will provide rich new data sets to test those theories. Ceres is also considered to be an asteroid, and is the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. As well as the carbonate deposits, Dawn also found other unusual features, such as Ahuna Mons, a conical mountain which sits in isolation on Ceres' surface, with nothing else like it nearby. It is approximately 3 miles tall and its formation is thought to involve cryovolcanism.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/stunning-new-views-of-ceres-mystery-bright-spots/"}, {"title": "NASA news: Dawn spacecraft has MONTHS left after 11-year space mission", "date": "2018-07-17", "content": "NASA'S Dawn spacecraft is nearing the final months of its 11-year-long space exploration mission as scientists revealed the space probe is low on fuel. The NASA space probe will continue to explore the solar system for as long as possible, continuing to collect data and images. NASA's experts estimate Dawn will run out of fuel in a matter of months, sometime between August and October this year. When this happens, the spacecraft's hydrazine-powered engines will cut out and Dawn will completely shut down. The spacecraft will forever remain locked in orbit around Ceres, a dwarf planet found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Marc Rayman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), said: \"Dawn's unique mission to orbit and explore two strange new worlds would have been impossible without ion propulsion. \"Dawn is truly an interplanetary spaceship, and it has been outstandingly productive as it introduced these fascinating and mysterious worlds to Earth.\" The Dawn space probe blasted off from Earth on September 27, 2007, on a mission to study protoplanets in the asteroid belt. Since launch, the spacecraft made successful up-close approaches to Ceres and sister asteroid Vesta - the two largest bodies between Jupiter and the Red Planet. For 14 months between 2011 and 2012, Dawn orbited Vesta to study the giant asteroid's surface and scan its core. Then the probe launched itself into the darkness of space on a two-year-long trek to Ceres. The NASA spacecraft has been investigating the protoplanet since 2015, making a series of incredible discoveries. Earlier this month the US space agency revealed incredible photographs of Ceres's surface taken by Dawn. The up-close snapshots of the planetoid revealed vast deposits of sodium carbonate on the surface - the biggest known deposits of the substance outside of Earth. All of the discoveries were made possible by the spacecraft's engines which help NASA keep the probe on track and oriented towards Earth to beam back information. Once Dawn's hydrazine tanks run out completely the spacecraft's thrusters will no longer be able to keep it connected to Earth. But for the remainders of its days, NASA aims to make full use of the spacecraft and continue exploring the distant space rock Ceres. Alongside high-resolution photographs of Ceres, the spacecraft collects gamma ray, neutron spectra and infrared observation data. The most recent Dawn observations, which started in early June, are currently focused on the Occator and Urvara crater parts of Ceres.

Earlier in June NASA said the exoplanet-hunting Kepler spacecraft will die down within the next few months. NASA said in a statement: \"Trailing Earth's orbit at 94 million miles away, the Kepler space telescope has survived many potential knock-outs during its nine years in flight, from mechanical failures to being blasted by cosmic rays. \"At this rate, the hardy spacecraft may reach its finish line in a manner we will consider a wonderful success. \"With nary a gas station to be found in deep space, the spacecraft is going to run out of fuel.\" ", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/990170/NASA-news-Dawn-spacecraft-mission-low-fuel-space"}, {"title": "Dwarf Planet Ceres' Bizarre Bright Spots Shine in Stunning Up-Close View", "date": "2018-07-17", "content": "You may have seen the bizarre bright spots speckling the dwarf planet Ceres - but not like this. NASA's Ceres-orbiting Dawn spacecraft has captured jaw-dropping new photos of several of the bright- white features, formally known as faculae, that lie at the bottom of the dwarf planet's 57-mile-wide Occator Crater. Dawn snapped the images from an elevation of about 21 miles - just three times higher than a commercial airliner flies, NASA officials said. \"The new images of Occator Crater and the surrounding areas have exceeded expectations, revealing beautiful, alien landscapes,\" Dawn principal investigator Carol Raymond, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement yesterday. The $467 million Dawn mission launched in September 2007 with a bold goal: to orbit and study the two largest bodies in the asteroid belt: Vesta and Ceres. Both objects are considered leftovers from the solar system's planet-formation period. Dawn reached Vesta in July 2011 and eyed the object up close for more than a year, finally leaving for Ceres in September 2012. Dawn discovered the Occator Crater bright spots during its approach to Ceres in early 2015, and later found a number of other crater-associated faculae around the dwarf planet. The probe's observations have since revealed that the bright spots are salty deposits, composed primarily of sodium carbonate and ammonium chloride. Scientists think this material was left behind when briny water boiled away into space, but they're not sure where, exactly, those brines came from - specifically, how deep underground the reservoirs were. Dawn team members are using the probe's observations to tackle this and other questions about the 590-mile-wide Ceres. Some of the most intriguing data and eye-popping photos come from Dawn's most recent mission phase, during which the probe has circled above Ceres at an altitude of just 21 miles or so. Dawn spiraled down to this superlow orbit early last month and will remain there through the end of its operational life, which is expected to come in a few months. The spacecraft is nearly out of hydrazine, the fuel that powers Dawn's small orientation-controlling thrusters. When the hydrazine is gone, Dawn will be unable to point its science instruments at Ceres, or its communications gear at Earth. The Dawn team is presenting the results from the latest mission phase this week at the Committee on Space Research conference in Pasadena.", "url": "https://www.space.com/41197-dwarf-planet-ceres-bright-spots-photos.html"}, {"title": "NASA's only mission to the asteroid belt is dying after 11 years in space - but it might tee up a future discovery of alien life", "date": "2018-09-07", "content": "NASA's only robot exploring the asteroid belt is about to die, the space agency explained during a live event on Friday. However, the Dawn probe pulled off a last-ditch maneuver this summer that is helping to create surface maps of a dwarf planet - information that may be used to land a future mission on the distant world. Dawn launched in 2007 and became the first NASA mission to use superefficient ion thrusters. In its yearslong voyage through deep space, the robot ended up in the asteroid belt, the mysterious and expansive zone between Mars and Jupiter. There, it has studied the region's two largest objects: Ceres and Vesta. Dawn reached Vesta first, in July 2011. Researchers think of Vesta, the second-largest object in the asteroid belt, as a \"time capsule\" for planet formation, since it failed to grow into something larger after the solar system's birth. After a year of exploration at Vesta, Dawn ion-propelled itself toward Ceres, a Texas-sized dwarf planet, where it arrived in March 2015. Ever since then, Dawn has made several major discoveries about the 592-mile-wide ice ball, including an ice volcano, shiny salt deposits, and other features that suggest a giant ocean may hide beneath the world's cratered crust - possibly one that could harbor alien microbes. NASA has since used up most of Dawn's remaining fuel to slip into an orbit that zooms within 22 miles of Ceres' surface about once a day. These flybys are about 10 times as close as the International Space Station orbits above Earth and have led to the sharpest, clearest images of the dwarf planet yet. \"This orbit was like putting your glasses on if you don't see very well - all of the sudden, all of this rich detail is popping out,\" Carol Raymond, Dawn's principal investigator and a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said during the press event on Friday. \"It will give us some insight as to what's going on with the plumbing system under the surface.\" However, these unprecedented images and other data have come with a cost: a death for Dawn before the end of the year. Why Dawn is now doomed? Using up Dawn's fuel to achieve such a close orbit has essentially stranded the spacecraft at Ceres. \"The current orbit should be stable for 50 years,\" Mark Sykes, the director of the Planetary Science Institute and a scientist on the Dawn mission, told Business Insider in an email. \"There is no desire to change the orbit - and no juice.\" Dawn uses its \"juice\" to keep itself powered and talking to NASA. So using up the last propellant will forever silence the probe. \"It will struggle for a short time, but it will be impotent,\" Marc Rayman, Dawn's mission manager and chief engineer, wrote in a blog post on August 22. \"Unable to point its electricity-generating solar panels at the sun or its radio antenna to Earth, the seasoned explorer will go silent and will explore no more. Its expedition will be over.\" Rayman said on Friday that Dawn might go silent within a month or so. \"We can't determine that with exquisite accuracy,\" he told Business Insider during the press event, adding that it was likely to run out of propellant (and stop talking to Earth) \"sometime in the middle of this month to the middle of October.\" But the team, while sad about the probe's coming demise, is counting its blessings, since the expedition was supposed to last nine years but has been going for nearly 11. Plus, Dawn continues to take high-resolution images of the surface once every 27 hours. Once the probe runs out of fuel, it won't spiral down and crash into Ceres for at least 20 years. In fact, Rayman said, the team's analysis shows a \"greater than 99%\" chance that Dawn will stay in its current orbit for half a century, \"and most likely longer than that.\" NASA wants to bring a sample of Ceres back to Earth. Rayman said the 20-year no-crash minimum was a core requirement of the Dawn mission. That's because NASA's planetary protection office, which tries to prevent contamination of other worlds by microbes from Earth, thinks two decades should be enough time for the agency to mount another mission to Ceres. A new probe could then look for signs of life without worrying about contamination by any microbes from Earth stuck to Dawn when it crashed. \"Ceres represents a place in the solar system that we're interested in for future astrobiological exploration,\" Rayman said. \"If NASA chooses to mount a follow-on mission to conduct subsequent astrobiological exploration, it's long enough to without being compromised by Dawn.\" Jim Green, NASA's chief scientist, said the agency had pulled together working groups to come up with a plan to send a robot to the surface of Ceres, possibly near a vent, where it could probe salts and other materials - and maybe even send samples from the dwarf planet back to Earth. \"We'll work out in the next decade whether one of those missions will indeed be going back to Ceres,\" Green said on Friday. The stakes are high as researchers discover more water and organic compounds elsewhere in the solar system - ingredients that may sustain rudimentary forms of alien life. \"We know there is an active geological cycle that's bringing material from deep inside up to the surface,\" Carol Raymond said. \"That gives us an opportunity to sample some of Ceres' internal material.\" As Dawn continues to rack up high-resolution images of Ceres' surface, the argument for collecting a sample of the dwarf planet may be strengthened. \"The holy grail of any planetary-science mission is a sample return, but it's also very difficult,\" Raymond said. \"With an object like Ceres, you really want to know where to sample.\" ", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-dawn-mission-to-asteroid-belt-ending-2018-9"}, {"title": "NASA's Asteroid Belt Spacecraft Dawn Is About To Run Out of Fuel", "date": "2018-09-12", "content": "Dawn has spent nearly a decade studying Ceres and Vesta, but it's time is running out. NASA's Dawn spacecraft has been zipping through the Asteroid Belt for the better part of a decade. It discovered water on the giant asteroid Vesta and ice volcanoes on the surface of Ceres, the largest object in the belt. But now its time is coming to an end. Last year NASA said that Dawn was running out of fuel. According to a new announcement from the agency, the spacecraft probably will shut down sometime in the next month or so. Dawn launched back in 2007 and arrived in the belt in 2011. For a few years it orbited the large asteroid Vesta, and then in 2015 it arrived at Ceres, an asteroid so big astronomers thought it was a planet when it was discovered two centuries ago (it now shares the dwarf planet classification with Pluto). Before Dawn's arrival, we had never seen these huge objects up close. It turns out they're full of surprises. During its long mission, Dawn made invaluable contributions to science including mapping the entire surface of both worlds, discovering water on Vesta, and discovering ice volcanoes on the surface of Ceres. Perhaps the most notable discovery Dawn ever made was discovering organic molecules on Ceres, meaning that the dwarf planet has at least some of the building blocks for life. That 2017 study was huge news. Ceres has never had an atmosphere or any kind of dynamic events on its surface. It's basically unchanged from when it was formed billions of years ago. For that reason, finding some organic molecules on Ceres suggests those molecules were probably present in the early days of the solar system, which in turn is a good sign for life elsewhere in the universe. That's the main reason Dawn went to the Asteroid Belt in the first place: Ceres and Vesta are like time capsules from the early solar system, and studying them can tell us a great deal about what that era was like. After three years observing Ceres, time is running out for Dawn. Early in the mission the spacecraft's reaction wheels broke, which meant the only way Dawn could maneuver was by using its thrusters and propellant. At some time over the next few weeks, Dawn will finally run out of propellent. Then it will be stranded in space. When that happens, NASA will have one last thing to take care of. It must make sure Dawn never lands on the surface of Ceres. Dawn is contaminated with Earth bacteria, and NASA needs to ensure that those bacteria are never spread to Ceres. To make this happen, Dawn will be placed into a stable orbit around Ceres before it runs out of fuel completely. Dawn will be able to stay in that orbit for many decades, until we decide to visit Ceres again.

In a talk Oct. 4 during the 69th International Astronautical Congress here, Marc Rayman, chief engineer and mission director for the Dawn mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said current estimates had the spacecraft exhausting its remaining hydrazine, and thus ending the mission, in the middle of this month. \"To within our current uncertainty, there's zero usable hydrazine remaining,\" he said. \"The hydrazine is projected to be depleted by mid-October.\" Rayman said mission planners are working on developing sequences for operating the spacecraft into December should their estimates of the remaining hydrazine turn out to be wrong. \"But, you know what, we're probably not wrong,\" he said. \"But we're going to continue as long as we can.\" Dawn, launched in September 2007 on a mission to orbit the large asteroid Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt, has relied on thrusters using hydrazine to orient itself since the failure of its reaction control wheels several years ago. \"When the hydrazine is depleted, because that's the sole basis for attitude control, the spacecraft will lose attitude control and the mission will end,\" Rayman said. A similar fate awaits Kepler, launched in 2009 to search for exoplanets by looking for brief, periodic dips in brightness of stars as planets cross in front, or transit, them. The failure of two of Kepler's four reaction wheels in 2013 forced engineers to devise an alternate control mechanism using the spacecraft's thrusters. The spacecraft, though, is running out of hydrazine, a development long expected by mission managers. The spacecraft went into a safe mode in July when telemetry suggested the spacecraft might be running out of fuel. Kepler transmitted the data from that observing effort, known as Campaign 18, in August, then went into safe mode again until Aug. 29, when it started a new observing session, Campaign 19, despite issues with a malfunctioning thruster. In a Sept. 28 statement, NASA said it had again put Kepler into safe mode because of problems pointing the spacecraft precisely. The spacecraft will transmit the data it collected in Campaign 19 back to Earth Oct. 10, assuming it has enough hydrazine on board to carry out that work. \"Due to uncertainties about the remaining available fuel, there is no guarantee that NASA will be able to download the science data,\" NASA said in the statement. \"If successful the Kepler team will attempt to start the next observing campaign with the remaining fuel.\" When Kepler does run out of fuel, it will drift in its orbit around the sun harmlessly. The situation is different for Dawn, which is in orbit around Ceres, a dwarf planet that has water ice. Rayman said planetary protection protocols require that Dawn be able to maintain its orbit, which currently brings it to within about 35 kilometers of the surface of Ceres, for at least 20 years. That should not be a problem, he said. Simulations of the spacecraft's orbit show a 99 percent chance it will still be in orbit after 50 years, the longest the simulations have been run. \"The lifetime in orbit is likely significantly longer than that,\" he said. That 20-year requirement is not based on any expectation that the spacecraft will be sterilized from radiation exposure during that time. Instead, that 20 years is intended to provide enough time to mount another mission to the world before its surface is contaminated by the impact of the spacecraft. \"There are good arguments for revisiting such criteria,\" he added, \"but that's not a topic for here.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasas-dawn-and-kepler-missions-near-their-ends/"}, {"title": "NASA's asteroid explorer Dawn soon to go dark", "date": "2018-10-19", "content": "After an 11-year journey to Vesta and Ceres, the asteroid belt's two largest members, NASA's Dawn spacecraft is expected to run out of thruster fuel in the next few weeks, ending its mission. The robotic explorer, which gave a close-up view of how the presence or absence of water can shape asteroids, will remain tumbling in orbit around Ceres for decades before ultimately crashing into it. Launched in 2007, Dawn is the only NASA mission to orbit two planetary bodies, a feat made possible by its efficient ion thrusters. In 2011, it arrived at the egg-shaped, 600-kilometer-long Vesta, orbiting for a year before departing for Ceres, where it arrived in 2015. The two asteroids, which together account for 45% of the belt's mass, turned out to be a tale of contrasts. Parched Vesta has a composition like the terrestrial planets, with an iron core and a dry, rocky surface carved up into canyons, craters, and mountains, remnants of past impacts and volcanism. Dawn was able to verify that a class of meteorites found on Earth are chips off of Vesta, making it a sort of \"reverse sample return mission,\" says Carol Raymond, the mission's principal investigator and a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. Telescopes had already found water-rich minerals on Ceres, a 900-kilometer-wide body classified as a dwarf planet because of its large size and spherical shape. Dawn revealed the remnants of a frozen ocean topped by a heavily cratered crust of clays and salts. \"We could not have imagined it would have looked like this,\" Raymond says. The young sun could have boiled away much of the water if Ceres had formed in its present location. So, some scientists suspect it was born out past Jupiter and Saturn, only to be drawn in by the gas giants' turbulent early gyrations. Dawn found a marker of this distant birthplace: ammonia, a volatile molecule that could have only formed in the outer solar system. Dawn also spotted a sign that Ceres remains geologically active: what looked like a lone volcano, 4 kilometers tall, that oozes a \"lava\" of water, salt, and other materials. Later observations spotted traces of 21 more volcanoes. And more than 100 bright spots rich in salt also suggested the subsurface ice finds its way to the surface here and there, as a slushy brine. One such spot, at Ernutet crater, showed signs of organic molecules-common in the outer solar system and not a signifier of life. But the discoveries have made Ceres a prime candidate for further exploration; a NASA study on a possible lander is expected to conclude next year. In its final months, Dawn settled into a tight orbit, just 35 kilometers from Ceres's surface. The defunct craft could remain in orbit for a half-century or more, says Marc Rayman, Dawn's mission director at JPL, \"an inert celestial monument around the dwarf planet it helped unveil.\" ", "url": "https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.362.6412.275"}, {"title": "The Final Days Of NASA's Dawn", "date": "2018-10-29", "content": "Dawn is riding off into the sunset. The NASA spacecraft-nearing the end of an eleven-year mission-is almost out of fuel. \"We're running on fumes,\" says Marc Rayman of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Indeed, what's left of the hydrazine-a key propellant-is virtually infinitesimal, not even enough for NASA scientists to measure. \"Our best analysis says we have zero,\" Rayman says. \"No useable hydrazine on the spacecraft.\" No one is certain exactly when the end will come. \"But very, very soon,\" says Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director. \"We expect it to be at any time. Perhaps any minute now.\" Orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres-and about 330 million miles from Earth-Dawn has been on borrowed time for weeks. NASA thought the spacecraft would be spent by mid-September; surely by mid-October. But Dawn \"just keeps performing,\" says Rayman. \"It's good to the last drop.\" The probe launched from Cape Canaveral in September, 2007. Then, little was known about Ceres, a cold, cryptic world roughly the width of Texas, and the largest body in the main asteroid belt. The journey took seven-and-a-half years, including a 14-month stopover at Vesta, the brightest asteroid in the solar system. Now we know more, much more. Dawn has delivered astronomers more than 100,000 images of Ceres and Vesta-a stunning celestial catalog. Of the two, Ceres is the more photogenic. An ice volcano, which once spit a frosty and muddy magma, reaches 13,000 feet. Organic materials, the \"building blocks\" for life, coat thousands of acres. A staggering amount of salt water, nearly all frozen, bulges below the surface; when it breaks ground, salt deposits-luminous, spooky-remain as glimmering residue. Dawn unveils, says Rayman, \"a beautiful and complex Ceres.\" Even now, flying on dregs, Dawn dips close every 27 hours, only 22 miles above the surface, collecting still more reconnaissance. \"Every bit of science we've been getting for a while is pure bonus,\" says Rayman. \"Every time Dawn goes to low altitude, we get unique, valuable data about Ceres.\" Researchers worldwide will scrutinize that data for decades. When the hydrazine goes, Dawn essentially loses equilibrium-and can no longer point its solar panels at the Sun, the antenna to Earth, or the sensors to Ceres. Dawn then is effectively dead in space. \"And that,\" Rayman declares, \"will be the end of the mission.\" Communication with the craft, via the Deep Space Network, is scheduled most days; scientists will know something's up when NASA calls and Dawn doesn't pick up. A single missed transmission doesn't necessarily mean anything. Several misses in a row, however, means it's over. \"It's going to take a significant fraction of a week, or maybe even a week, before we can make a confident determination,\" says Rayman. Muted, dimmed, and disconnected, Dawn will commence a long, quiet ride around Ceres, a slow dance designed to last decades. NASA guarantees 20 years before the spacecraft ultimately crashes. \"But even in 50 years,\" says Rayman, \"we have greater than 99 percent confidence that Dawn will still be in orbit.\" The longer, the better. NASA might decide, one day, to go back to Ceres; its organic materials await further study. Yet Dawn is covered with carbon-containing molecules-Earth microbes, plastics, chemicals (let's call it 'terraphernalia'). A smashup might taint the pristine surface. But a 50-year orbit (or even 20) gives NASA a window to mount a mission, Rayman says, \"without the results distorted by contamination.\" In the meantime, what's ahead for Dawn-that languid, drowsy tumble around Ceres-somehow seems fitting. \"Dawn will become an inert, celestial monument to human creativity and ingenuity,\" Rayman says.

NASA announced that the Dawn spacecraft was silent during two communications sessions on the Deep Space Network Oct. 31 and Nov. 1. After eliminating other possible causes for the lack of transmissions, managers concluded that the spacecraft had run out of hydrazine fuel for its attitude control thrusters, preventing it from maneuvering to orient its main antenna towards the Earth or its solar panels towards the sun. That lack of maneuverability ends the spacecraft's mission, as expected. Project officials had warned for months that the mission would likely end this fall based on estimates of the remaining hydrazine on the spacecraft. \"To within our current uncertainty, there's zero usable hydrazine remaining,\" said Marc Rayman, chief engineer and mission director for Dawn at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, during a presentation Oct. 4 at the International Astronautical Congress in Bremen, Germany. At the time he said the spacecraft would likely run out of fuel in the middle of October. Dawn, built by Orbital Sciences Corp., launched in 2007 as part of NASA's Discovery program of lower-cost planetary science missions. The spacecraft, propelled by electric thrusters, entered orbit around the large main belt asteroid Vesta in July 2011. After leaving Vesta in September 2012, Dawn entered orbit around Ceres, the dwarf planet that is the largest object in the main asteroid belt, in March 2015. Dawn remained in orbit around Ceres for the rest of its mission, although mission managers proposed at one point leaving orbit to fly by another asteroid. NASA elected to keep Dawn at Ceres and fly in different orbits around it, including its final orbit that brought the spacecraft to within 35 kilometers of the planet's surface. The data collected by Dawn helped scientists better understand the two worlds, as well as broader questions about the formation and evolution of the solar system. Observations of Ceres in particular indicated that it might once had, and could still have today, a subsurface ocean of liquid water. \"Dawn's data sets will be deeply mined by scientists working on how planets grow and differentiate, and when and where life could have formed in our solar system,\" said Carol Raymond, principal investigator for Dawn at JPL, in a statement. \"Ceres and Vesta are important to the study of distant planetary systems, too, as they provide a glimpse of the conditions that may exist around young stars.\" With its hydrazine depleted, Dawn will remain in orbit for decades before eventually crashing to the surface of Ceres. NASA said that there is a more than 99 percent chance the spacecraft will remain in orbit for at least 50 years. \"The demands we put on Dawn were tremendous, but it met the challenge every time,\" Rayman said in the statement. \"It's hard to say goodbye to this amazing spaceship, but it's time.\" The end of the Dawn mission comes two days after NASA announced the end of another mission, Kepler. Both spacecraft ended their missions because they ran out of hydrazine fuel needed for attitude control, and both had suffered failures of reaction control wheels earlier in their missions that made them rely on their thrusters more than originally planned. Despite the similarities, there was little in the way of interaction between the two missions as their spacecraft used up their last of their hydrazine. \"Our needs for fuel were different than theirs,\" said Charlie Sobeck, project system engineer for Kepler at NASA's Ames Research Center, during an Oct. 30 briefing about the end of that mission. \"We had more communication with Dawn about reaction wheels than we did about fuel.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/dawn-mission-to-asteroid-belt-ends/"}, {"title": "Dawn Is Dead: NASA's Pioneering Asteroid-Belt Mission Runs Out of Fuel", "date": "2018-11-01", "content": "Darkness has finally come for Dawn.

Dawn's death is the second blow of a rapid one-two punch for space fans. NASA officials announced Tuesday that the agency's Kepler space telescope, which has discovered 70 percent of the 3,800 known alien planets to date, is out of fuel as well. Kepler will be decommissioned in the next week or two. The $467 million Dawn mission launched in September 2007 to study the protoplanet Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres, which are about 330 miles and 590 miles wide, respectively. Scientists regard these two bodies as leftovers from the solar system's planet-formation period, which explains the mission's name. Dawn arrived at Vesta in July 2011, then scrutinized the object from orbit for 14 months. The probe's work revealed many intriguing details about Vesta. For example, liquid water once flowed across the protoplanet's surface, and Vesta sports a towering peak near its south pole that's nearly as tall as Mars' famous Olympus Mons volcano. Dawn left Vesta in September 2012. The probe arrived at Ceres in March 2015, becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a dwarf planet, and the first to circle two bodies beyond the Earth-moon system. Such spaceflight feats were made possible by Dawn's superefficient ion engines, mission team members have said. \"The demands we put on Dawn were tremendous, but it met the challenge every time,\" mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in the same statement. Dawn discovered a number of intriguing bright spots on Ceres. Mission team members determined these features to be salts, which were likely left behind when briny water from the subsurface bubbled up and boiled away into space. The bright spots are young, suggesting that Ceres sported buried pockets of liquid water in the recent past - and probably even retains some of these pockets today, mission team members have said. The dwarf planet is therefore an intriguing target for astrobiologists, especially when another Dawn discovery is taken into account: The probe detected organic molecules, the carbon-containing building blocks of life as we know it, on Ceres' surface. Dawn also spotted a 2.5-mile-high \"lonely mountain,\" by far the tallest surface feature on the dwarf planet. This mountain, which came to be called Ahuna Mons, is probably a cryovolcano that formed in the last few hundred million years, mission scientists have said. \"In many ways, Dawn's legacy is just beginning,\" mission principal investigator Carol Raymond, also of JPL, said in the same statement. \"Dawn's data sets will be deeply mined by scientists working on how planets grow and differentiate, and when and where life could have formed in our solar system. Ceres and Vesta are important to the study of distant planetary systems, too, as they provide a glimpse of the conditions that may exist around young stars.\" The mission team concluded that Dawn had run out of hydrazine after the probe missed scheduled communication check-ins yesterday and today. Hydrazine is the fuel used by Dawn's pointing thrusters, so the spacecraft can no longer orient itself to study Ceres, relay data to Earth or recharge its solar panels. Dawn will remain in orbit around Ceres for at least 20 years, and probably much longer than that. Mission team members have said there's a greater than 99 percent probability that the probe won't spiral down onto Ceres' frigid, battered surface for at least five more decades. The deaths of both Dawn and Kepler did not come as a surprise. Mission team members have known for months that the tanks of both spacecraft were getting very dry.

Dawn can no longer keep its antennas trained on Earth to communicate with mission control or turn its solar panels to the Sun to recharge. The Dawn spacecraft launched 11 years ago to visit the two largest objects in the main asteroid belt. Currently, it's in orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres, where it will remain for decades. \"Today, we celebrate the end of our Dawn mission - its incredible technical achievements, the vital science it gave us, and the entire team who enabled the spacecraft to make these discoveries,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The astounding images and data that Dawn collected from Vesta and Ceres are critical to understanding the history and evolution of our solar system.\" Dawn launched in 2007 on a journey that put about 4.3 billion miles (6.9 billion kilometers) on its odometer. Propelled by ion engines, the spacecraft achieved many firsts along the way. In 2011, when Dawn arrived at Vesta, the second largest world in the main asteroid belt, the spacecraft became the first to orbit a body in the region between Mars and Jupiter. In 2015, when Dawn went into orbit around Ceres, a dwarf planet that is also the largest world in the asteroid belt, the mission became the first to visit a dwarf planet and go into orbit around two destinations beyond Earth. \"The fact that my car's license plate frame proclaims, 'My other vehicle is in the main asteroid belt,' shows how much pride I take in Dawn,\" said Mission Director and Chief Engineer Marc Rayman at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). \"The demands we put on Dawn were tremendous, but it met the challenge every time. It's hard to say goodbye to this amazing spaceship, but it's time.\" The data Dawn beamed back to Earth from its four science experiments enabled scientists to compare two planet-like worlds that evolved very differently. Among its accomplishments, Dawn showed how important location was to the way objects in the early solar system formed and evolved. Dawn also reinforced the idea that dwarf planets could have hosted oceans over a significant part of their history - and potentially still do. \"In many ways, Dawn's legacy is just beginning,\" said Principal Investigator Carol Raymond at JPL. \"Dawn's data sets will be deeply mined by scientists working on how planets grow and differentiate, and when and where life could have formed in our solar system. Ceres and Vesta are important to the study of distant planetary systems, too, as they provide a glimpse of the conditions that may exist around young stars.\" Because Ceres has conditions of interest to scientists who study chemistry that leads to the development of life, NASA follows strict planetary protection protocols for the disposal of the Dawn spacecraft. Dawn will remain in orbit for at least 20 years, and engineers have more than 99 percent confidence the orbit will last for at least 50 years. So, while the mission plan doesn't provide the closure of a final, fiery plunge - the way NASA's Cassini spacecraft ended last year, for example - at least this is certain: Dawn spent every last drop of hydrazine making science observations of Ceres and radioing them back so we could learn more about the solar system we call home.

Is it time to start thinking about sending another mission to the dwarf planet? The $467 million Dawn spacecraft launched in 2007 on a mission to study the two largest objects in the asteroid belt, Vesta and Ceres. After studying the asteroid Vesta from orbit for about a year, it moved on to Ceres, the smallest dwarf planet in the solar system and the largest space rock orbiting in the asteroid belt. While in orbit at Ceres, Dawn discovered that the dwarf planet sports hundreds of weird bright spots, contains plenty of water ice and has organic molecules on its surface. By the mission's end, however, scientists were still left with some big questions about Ceres and what it can teach us about the possibilities of life beyond Earth - questions that could be answered with a follow-up trip to the surface. One of the last images of Ceres from NASA's Dawn spacecraft shows bright spots in Occator Crater. Dawn captured this view on Sept. 1, 2018, from an altitude of 2,340 miles above the dwarf planet's surface. \"I think the kinds of questions that we are going to be left with will probably require going down to the surface, because there's only so much you can tell from orbit,\" Paul Schenk, a participating scientist for the Dawn mission with the Universities Space Research Association at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, told Space.com. Specifically, Schenk said he would like to see a mission sent to explore Occator Crater, a 57-mile-wide crater containing the biggest and brightest of Ceres' spots. Like the other bright spots on Ceres, Occator Crater contains salty deposits that were left behind when briny water sprayed up from underground and then froze on the surface. This discovery by the Dawn mission revealed that the interior of Ceres is warmer than scientists previously thought. In the case of Occator Crater, a recent impact was likely the source of that heat, Schenk said. The most prevalent mineral at Occator Crater is sodium carbonate, which also happens to be prevalent in places on Earth that show hydrothermal activity - places like Yellowstone National Park \"where certain types of bacteria are known to thrive,\" Schenk said. However, he said that it's \"rather unlikely\" that microbial life exists on Ceres, because the heat generated from impacts doesn't last long enough for life to evolve. \"The impact generates enough heat to melt the ice and create the groundwaters that can then circulate in a central area,\" he said, but \"the zone of heat contracts until the water goes away and freezes up\" over the course of tens of thousands to a few million years. Here on Earth, the earliest forms of life arose 700 million years after the Earth formed. Regardless of whether Ceres is capable of hosting life - a possibility that scientists have neither ruled out nor confirmed at this point - the hydrothermal processes seen on the dwarf planet could help scientists understand similar processes on other bodies in the solar system, like Jupiter's moon Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus - two of the top contenders for hosting possible life beyond Earth. Features resembling dried-up hydrothermal vents on Mars could also have sustained life sometime in the planet's history. Like the bacteria that live in deep-sea hydrothermal vents on Earth, organisms living in similar geological features on other world don't need sunlight to survive. Instead, they would rely on geothermal energy, like hydrothermal vents and plate tectonics. In the case of Ceres, getting hit with other large space rocks appears to be the source of its geothermal energy. \"Hydrothermal reactions with the water are clearly bringing up minerals to the surface,\" Schenk said. \"In order to understand how that process works on other planets, including Mars, going back and understanding that chemistry and that physics - the physical process of what actually happens, how those materials delivered to the surface and what reactions are taking take place - are going to be important to understanding hydrothermal processes throughout the solar system. We have a lot of that information here on Earth, but the chemistry of Earth's crust is very different than it is on Ceres.\" Landing and roving on Ceres Because Occator Crater holds some tantalizing clues about the conditions necessary for life to arise on other worlds, scientists are hoping to send a lander to further explore Ceres' most fascinating feature, Schenk said. Ideally, any future missions would involve a small rover like the ones that landed on the asteroid Ryugu in September. \"It would have to be able to take some instruments that can tell you some diagnostic information about the composition, so it would have to survive the landing, and it probably would need to be able to move around to get to the specific site of interest, because you have to land safely but then you have to go to the area that's interesting, which could be complicated,\" Schenk said. While Dawn could only study Ceres from orbit, reaching a closest altitude of 22 miles, a spacecraft on the surface could learn more about the dwarf planet's composition by scooping a sample and analyzing it in situ, or inside the spacecraft itself. Dawn used spectrometers to determine what elements are on the dwarf planet's surface, but those measurements are \"dominated by those materials that are spectrally active, those that reveal absorption bands at particular wavelengths,\" and carbonaceous materials don't show up well in those measurements, Schenk said. \"Carbonaceous materials often are pretty bland, so we probably have to go down to the surface to find it.\" Scientists have been working on preliminary plans for the next mission to Ceres since as early as 2008, or seven years before Dawn would become the first spacecraft to visit the dwarf planet. A proposed mission called the Ceres Polar Lander would send an orbiter-lander combo to Ceres, dropping the lander at its north pole to search for clues about life. The mission would use the same kind of soft-landing techniques NASA has used to land spacecraft on Mars. A team of researchers with the European aerospace manufacturing company Thales Alenia Space and the University of Nantes in France presented the Ceres Polar Lander mission concept at the European Planetary Science Congress in 2008. When the Ceres Polar Lander was first proposed, scientists thought that Ceres' north pole would be the most interesting place to study. However, this was long before Dawn discovered Occator Crater, which is now arguably the most interesting place on Ceres. Currently, no space agencies have plans to send another mission to Ceres, but that could change now that the Dawn mission has ended. Any proposed NASA missions will have to go through a lengthy review process before they can be selected to go to Ceres, but in the meantime, scientists have plenty of data from Dawn to sift through, Schenk said. \"We're only starting to understand Ceres ... it's going to take a while to figure out what we're actually seeing.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/42335-should-nasa-send-another-mission-to-ceres.html"}, {"title": "Dear Dawntasmagorias", "date": "2018-11-11", "content": "Following a successful mission, Dawn mission operations concluded successfully on Oct. 31. After more than 11 years in deep space, after unveiling the two largest uncharted worlds in the inner solar system, after overcoming myriad daunting obstacles, Dawn's interplanetary adventure came to an end. We explained in detail in the two August Dawn Journals that the spaceship would deplete its supply of hydrazine, which was essential for controlling its orientation as it orbited dwarf planet Ceres. We predicted that the last of the hydrazine would be spent between mid-September and mid-October. Dawn, ever the overachiever, held on until the end of October, and the explorer was productive to the very end. This was the best way to end a mission. It was good to the last drop! Dawn took us on a truly amazing solar system journey. Never content simply to do the same thing over and over, the flight team kept coming up with new kinds of activities and new kinds of observations from new orbital perspectives. With such a long and constantly active mission, it may have seemed like it would just keep going. For readers who did not keep up with our recent forecasts of the end, it might be worth recognizing Stein's Law: \"If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\" Dawn demonstrates not only Stein's Law but also Davies' Corollaries (proposed by Daniel Davies, a financial analyst): 1.Things that can't go on forever, go on much longer than you think they will. 2. Corollary 1 applies even after taking into account Corollary 1. When it stopped, Dawn was in its extended mission orbit 7. Every 27 hours, the intrepid ship dove from 2,500 miles to 22 miles above the ground, only three times higher than a typical passenger aircraft travels over Earth, and then soared back up again. It had a fantastic view as it streaked over the alien landscape at 1,050 mph. The spacecraft expertly performed high-resolution measurements, providing scientists with a wealth of exquisite data and giving everyone incredibly detailed looks at the exotic sights. On Oct. 31, Dawn flew down to peridemeter shortly after 5:00 am PDT. As always, to keep its solar arrays pointed at the Sun and its sensors pointed at the ground, it had to fire its hydrazine thrusters extensively. Using the thrusters was routine after having operated for more than half of its time in space without the use of the reaction wheels that were intended for controlling its orientation, but which had failed. While the spacecraft didn't know the hydrazine was about to run out, mission controllers had known for quite some time. As is typical for missions in deep space, Dawn operated most of the time out of radio contact. NASA's Deep Space Network cannot serve all missions simultaneously, and often spacecraft have tasks to perform that are incompatible with radio communications. As it turned out, however, Dawn's final moments happened to be while the largest antenna at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California was tracking it. The 230-foot antenna thus allowed the flight team to hear Dawn's swan song. We have described before that with Dawn broadcasting through an auxiliary antenna when it flew close to the ground, scientists and engineers could learn about Ceres' interior. The spacecraft's radio signal was too weak to carry data to the DSN. Rather, it was as if Dawn were playing a single note with no variation. That may not make for an especially imaginative or melodious performance, but as different regions underground exerted their gravitational pulls and accelerated and decelerated the probe, the Doppler shift was music to the ears of planetary geologists. By observing changes in the strength and some other characteristics of the signal, engineers were able to reconstruct some of the spacecraft's final actions. Around 20 minutes after it was at peridemeter, still quite low but with its momentum starting to carry it back up to high altitudes, the hydrazine thrusters became ineffective. Dawn recognized that it could no longer control its orientation and systematically proceeded through all the contingency procedures possible, such as swapping to backup equipment and even rebooting its main computer. It made valiant attempts and continued to operate with the professionalism of a dedicated, veteran space explorer, but without hydrazine, there was nothing it could do. The outcome was inevitable. Dawn was up against an unsolvable problem. Although the spacecraft's depletion of hydrazine and subsequent inability to communicate had been predicted for quite some time, your correspondent considered it worthwhile to verify the diagnosis. It was possible, albeit highly unlikely, that some other problem had befallen Dawn and that after the scheduled session with the Goldstone antenna, the sophisticated robot would solve it and try to reestablish radio contact. The plan then was for the flight team to look for Dawn at night. Hours after young trick-or-treaters everywhere had finished extorting sweets from their elders, when Earth had rotated so that another 230-foot antenna, the largest at the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex, could point at Dawn's location in the sky, controllers listened again. Not even the faintest whisper was heard. The remote spacecraft was orbiting Ceres as silently as the cold vacuum of space itself. After more than 11 years of an incredibly exciting, fantastically fruitful, extremely difficult, deeply rewarding, super fun and just totally awesome interplanetary adventure, your correspondent declared the mission over shortly before 1:30 am PDT on Nov. 1. The mission had been a dream come true. Now the dream was over. Somehow, the stark reality of the end of the phantasmagorical mission in the middle of the night seemed to turn upside down the meaning of a proverb commonly attributed to Africa: \"However long the night, dawn will break.\" This video captures some of the highlights of Dawn's interplanetary adventure, as well as some personal reflections on it. With a rare excursion into first person, I wrote in my Aug. 22 Dawn Journal about how I felt with the mission coming to an end ). My feelings were unchanged when the end came. Nevertheless, in the actual event, I wrote down some of my thoughts, because Dawn was such a significant part of my life, and I am well aware of the fallibility of human memory. Memories, however vivid, are often more of a reconstruction than people like to believe. But I quickly realized that it didn't matter how I was feeling! Here is an unedited excerpt of what I wrote after declaring the mission to be over: \"These feelings are transitory, and I don't need to remember them anyway. It would be a mistake to consider how I feel now as somehow representing my overall experience or feelings about the mission. Indeed, this is very much the wrong time to try to put it into perspective. It would make a good story if I had some revelation or profound description of my feelings at this point, but there's no reason I should. It takes time to gain a good perspective. People construct and then gradually change their memories, all without any awareness. And I should not think that somehow now I will be imbued with the wisdom, insight, or other capability to put this into perspective. If I feel sad, elated, disappointed, relieved, proud, empty, gratified or any of myriad other feelings -- and, more to the point, a combination of myriad feelings -- I won't feel that way again. The end of Dawn is not what's important. All that preceded it is. And I cannot so easily grasp it all right now, so my feelings now are not as special or as meaningful as one might be tempted to think.\" Finally, you can't appreciate the end of the mission if you don't appreciate the rest of the mission. So, feel free to reread the previous 310,000 words in Dawn Journals to gain the full appreciation. There will be future opportunities to address some of the overall accomplishments of the mission and discoveries about Ceres. For now, we will devote more attention to this final phase. And there was no doubt about its finality. On Nov. 1-2, immediately after the official end of the mission, there was not enough time to reallocate previously scheduled DSN antenna time to other missions. So although confidence was high that Dawn would forever be silent, each of the three deep space communications complexes turned a sensitive ear to Ceres for one last time. No surprises occurred. The final phase of Dawn's exploration began in June when it completed maneuvering to XMO7. We have explained that as the orbit precessed so that peridemeter gradually shifted from Ceres' day side to the night side, photography, infrared spectroscopy and visible spectroscopy became less valuable. The spacecraft had collected a tremendous number of such measurements earlier in the mission, so when it flew over illuminated terrain in XMO7 at higher altitudes than it had already been, new observations were not worthwhile. Recognizing that the hydrazine would be long gone by the time peridemeter moved back to the day side, controllers took advantage of a nice opportunity at higher altitude for a last, fond look at Ceres on Sept. 1-2. As the dwarf planet pirouetted before the admiring eye of its permanent companion, Dawn recorded its final views of Ceres. One of them is shown above and another is below. On Sept. 28 and 29, Dawn performed a calibration of the camera and the visible and infrared mapping spectrometer for one last time. They are precision scientific instruments, and the thorough analysis of their data depends on accurate knowledge of their sensitivity and other properties. The team has conducted calibrations throughout the mission so even slight changes could be detected and accounted for in interpreting the pictures and spectra and drawing conclusions about the nature of Vesta and Ceres. Dawn expended a little more of its remaining hydrazine to point the instruments at the stars Vega and Arcturus, which they had observed before. Indeed, the first time was less than three months after the journey began in 2007. Even though Dawn took no more pictures nor infrared or visible spectra of Ceres after the beginning of September, it acquired a great many before that, far exceeding the team's expectations when planning this phase of the mission. In XMO7, the spacecraft sent more than 11,000 photographs of Ceres to Earth, almost all of them at very low altitude, revealing amazing new details. Also during XMO7, Dawn provided scientists with more than three million infrared spectra and almost 50,000 visible spectra. We have explained before that Ceres' nuclear glow is very faint, so the gamma ray and neutron detector requires a great deal of data to make its measurements, just as a camera needs a long exposure to record a dark scene. Despite its name, GRaND is meek and unprepossessing, but the instrument does do a wonderful job revealing the atomic composition of the material down to about a yard underground. GRaND does not need illumination, so it continued to operate even as Dawn glided over ground cloaked in the deep dark of night. In XMO7, GRaND acquired 140 hours of nuclear spectra from altitudes below Dawn's previous low altitude orbit, at 240 miles in 2015-2016. And it accumulated 50 hours of measurements of Ceres' radiation from within 60 miles of the ground. GRaND collected about four times as much data in XMO7 as scientists needed to meet their objectives. This will allow them to see Ceres' elemental abundances with much sharper resolution, like a close-up picture, than ever before. Like the other investigations, gravity measurements far surpassed what the team expected not only when planning XMO7 but even when the spacecraft was there. With the smooth and productive operations in XMO7, these successes may all seem pretty simple. After all, it's only the cutting edge of rocket science, operating an ion propelled spaceship at incredibly low altitude around a dwarf planet well over a million times farther away than the International Space Station. But there were a few challenges to overcome. The team confronted and solved myriad problems to accomplish so much. Now, even if you don't have your own interplanetary spacecraft, you can explore Ceres and do so from the comfort of your home. Instead of going all the way to the main asteroid belt, bring that distant world to your computer with Cerestrek. You can also see all the sights on the first world Dawn unveiled with Vestatrek. Dawn, however, will never again explore alien worlds. It will never again emit a bluish beam of xenon ions. It will never again communicate with beings on the faraway planet where its voyage began. It will never again perform any of the functions or tasks it executed so admirably on its remarkable journey. For decades, and quite possibly even for centuries, the ship that undertook a long, daring, difficult and successful deep-space expedition on behalf of humankind will remain silently in orbit around Ceres. It has become an inert celestial monument to the power of human ingenuity, creativity, and curiosity, a lasting reminder that our passion for bold adventures and our noble aspirations to know the cosmos can take us very, very far beyond the confines of our humble home. Dawn is 1,800 miles from Ceres. It is also 3.53 AU from Earth, or 1,320 times as far as the moon and 3.56 times as far as the Sun today. Radio signals, traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light, will never again make the round trip.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2018/11/dear-dawntasmagorias"}, {"title": "Dawn, the intrepid explorer of multiple worlds", "date": "2018-11-23", "content": "As another spacecraft prepares to land on Mars, the Dawn spacecraft recently ended its mission to explore two of the largest worlds in the asteroid belt and it has succeeded well beyond expectations, starting a new era in the exploration of the Solar System's small worlds. As the age of robotic planetary exploration began, as early as 1964, mission plans were drawn up to explore the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, to characterize these worlds which are regarded as leftovers from the formation of the Solar System. These \"leftovers\" promise to answer many questions about how the Solar System and its worlds, including Earth, formed, and possibly even how Earth came to bear life. The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft passed through the asteroid belt on their way to Jupiter and demonstrated that space probes could navigate safely through the belt even though thousands of small, rocky worlds were orbiting in the belt. After the Voyager probes passed through the asteroid belt, the Comet Rendezvous and Asteroid Flyby probe was planned to fly by asteroids and explore a comet before it was canceled in 1992 due to budget cuts. In the meantime, several comet flybys occurred, including flybys by Comet Giacobini-Zinner in 1985 and Comet Halley in 1986, as probes began to explore the smaller worlds of the solar system. On October 29, 1991, the Galileo probe made the first ever spacecraft flyby of an asteroid, flying past 951 Gaspra and returning pictures and data of this main-belt asteroid while on its way to Jupiter. On August 28, 1993, Galileo flew by asteroid 243 Ida and discovered that Ida had its own moon, which is now called Dactyl. After Galileo's asteroid flybys, a new era of \"better, faster, cheaper\" probes was launched at NASA and missions such as NEAR-Shoemaker, Deep Space One, and Stardust flew by asteroids and gathered data. NEAR-Shoemaker orbited 433 Eros for three years before making a successful soft landing on the asteroid, a landing that had not been planned while the mission was being designed. The European Space Agency, Japan's JAXA, and the Chinese later followed with their own asteroid flybys, either as standalone missions or as targets of opportunity on their way to other destinations. The Deep Space One probe launched in October 1998 was a key step toward future asteroid probes, including a ground-breaking proposal that would be considered in the next Discovery mission proposal review, as it was the first operational interplanetary use of an ion engine, auto-navigation, new solar array technology, and other new developments. The ion engine, in particular, would be necessary for the success of a mission proposal to orbit two large asteroids that was being developed. The engine was powered by xenon gas ionized by an electrical field and had a very small thrust, but could thrust continuously for days, weeks, months, years on end, and could be stopped and restarted, thus enabling missions that would not be possible with the rocket engines previously used in planetary missions. The Dawn mission to orbit the two largest, most massive \"proto-planets\" in the Solar System, 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta, was submitted as a Discovery mission proposal and was approved in December 2001 along with the Kepler exoplanet survey mission. Orbital Sciences built the spacecraft, which is 5.38 x 4.16 x 5.80 feet and which weighs 2,684 lbs.. The craft was equipped with two solar panel wings measuring 27.2 feet by 7.5 feet and which generated 10.3 kW near Earth and around 1.3 kW at near Ceres' distance from the Sun. Dawn was equipped with three instruments for its science mission. The first of these, the Framing Camera, developed in Germany by the German Aerospace Center and the Max Planck Institute, was the craft's main science and navigation camera, so it was actually made up of two separate camera systems. The camera had a 20 mm aperture, a 1024 x 1024 CCD, an 8 position filter wheel, and took navigation and science images of Ceres and Vesta. The second instrument, the Visible and Infrared Spectrometer was based on the Rosetta and Venus Express VIRTIS spectrometer and was developed by the Italian Space Agency. The VIR can determine surface mineral composition and also detect water-bearing minerals, and operates at a range of 250 nm to 5 micrometers. The third instrument, the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector was developed at Los Alamos and can measure elemental composition of asteroids, including any ices that would be present. During launch preparations, Dawn was also equipped with a microchip containing the names of more than 360,000 space enthusiasts which had put their names onto a NASA web site as part of an outreach effort. This chip is underneath the high- gain antenna and is still on the spacecraft orbiting Ceres for at least twenty years after its end of mission. NASA has continued this practice with other solar system missions up to the present day. Dawn had a bumpy path to the launch pad, being canceled twice before being revived, being delayed from its original launch date in 2006, and suffering launch postponements in the summer of 2007 due to various issues with weather and part deliveries. These postponements even extended to the launch day itself due to an errant ship entering the \"keep-out\" zone near the launch pad and a subsequent collision-avoidance window to avoid other spacecraft or space debris. On September 27, 2007, at 7:34 am Eastern Daylight Time, the Dawn probe launched successfully from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Delta II launch vehicle and achieved escape velocity from Earth, after which Dawn started its ion engine to continue on its path to Vesta, via a flyby of Mars some 17 months after launch. This flyby of Mars would enable Dawn to save fuel so that it could perform its mission without having to use a larger rocket to lift off from Earth. Despite going into safe mode during the day due to a programming error, Dawn successfully flew by Mars on February 17, 2009, to gain speed and to put the probe on its trajectory toward Vesta, and the probe arrived at the 329 mile diameter world in the summer of 2011 after traveling 1.7 billion miles. On July 16, 2011 the Dawn probe entered orbit around Vesta and began obtaining imagery and data while moving into a 69 hour survey orbit 1710 miles above the surface. Dawn later moved into a 12 hour high altitude mapping orbit at 420 miles, then in December 2011 moved into a 4 hour low altitude mapping orbit at 130 miles. Dawn imaged Vesta at a high resolution and discovered \"grooves\" in the surface near the equator that were caused by two giant impacts in the south polar region. The first of these impacts created the Veneneia crater, and the next, larger, impact formed the Rheasilvia crater which covered over part of Veneneia. This impact not only nearly destroyed Vesta and sprayed ejecta all over the asteroid, it was responsible for sending samples of Vesta to Earth and other places in the Solar System, as HED meteorites, meteorites that are confirmed now to match the composition of Vesta's surface. These meteorites have different compositions and suggest that Vesta is differentiated into a core and mantle similar to planets like Earth and Mars. In many respects, Vesta turns out to be much more like a planet than a typical asteroid, with active geological features like landslides as well as a differentiated composition. The HED meteorite link to Vesta and the increased density in the center of Vesta were confirmed by Dawn gravity and spectral data. Vesta was found by Dawn to have dark spots on its surface that appear to be carbonaceous in composition and are thought to not be native to Vesta but brought to Vesta by impactors from other parts of the Solar System, and later blasted as ejecta to other parts of Vesta by the Rheasilvia impact. The Rheasilvia impact also created one of the largest mountains in the Solar System, which is 14 miles high and 120 miles wide. In addition, gullies have been discovered on Vesta that could have been formed by temporary liquid water flows after impacts. After a successful exploration of Vesta, Dawn was scheduled to break orbit and start its journey to Ceres on August 26, 2012, but a reaction wheel issue caused a delay in departure while the issue was analyzed. On September 5th, the departure was successfully executed and Dawn was on its way to explore a second world in the asteroid belt. The way to Ceres was not completely smooth due to a safe mode event in September 2014 when the ion engine briefly shut down. Backup systems were activated and the mission resumed its journey to Ceres. After a 30 month, 930 million mile journey, Dawn arrived at Ceres on March 6, 2015, becoming the first probe to arrive at a dwarf planet. Ceres, a world with a diameter of 588 miles, had been promoted from asteroid to dwarf planet status as a result of the IAU's 2006 definition of planethood, the same decision that demoted Pluto from planetary status to the new \"plutoid\" dwarf planet status. Dwarf planets are those worlds that have sufficient gravity and mass to become round but that don't clear their orbit. Dawn began imaging Ceres during the RC3 phase from April to June 2015 and entered a survey orbit afterward. After successfully dealing with a safe mode event brought on by an engine gimbal system glitch, Dawn moved into high and low altitude mapping orbits and 7 XMO phases which ended with Dawn orbiting just 22 miles above the surface before the mission ended. During 2003 and 2004 the Hubble Space Telescope imaged Ceres and found a very bright spot on its surface, one that was very intriguing. Dawn imaged this spot and found that it was a crater with very bright spots of highly reflective salts, a crater now known as Occator Crater. Further analysis found that Ceres is still geologically active, and Occator Crater in particular was found to have sodium carbonate, a marker of hydrothermal activity. Ceres, like Vesta, is a differentiated world with a water-rich crust, a mantle, and a core, making it far more planet-like than most bodies in the asteroid belt. Ceres also contains young terrains as well as older terrains, and Occator Crater is not the only place on this world with salt deposits or hydrothermal activity, as there are a number of deposits scattered throughout Ceres. There is a great deal of water ice at higher latitudes and hydrated salts plus clathrates, and Dawn also found one crater that had a permanently shadowed area with water ice, similar to craters on the Moon and Mercury. It is also believed that Ceres came from the outer part of the Solar System due to the discovery of ammonia on the world. This is an indication that the Solar System was possibly reshuffled one or more times before its current configuration. By 2016, the mission had finished gathering the required scientific data of Ceres and was into an extended mission to gather further data. A flyby of asteroid 2 Pallas was considered but it was ultimately decided that a greater scientific return could be obtained by staying at Ceres. Dawn continued gathering data and taking spectacular close-up pictures of targets on Ceres until late October 2018, when communication was lost with the spacecraft. On November 1, 2018, the Dawn spacecraft ended its intrepid, history-making mission as it ran out of fuel while orbiting Ceres. Though the mission is now ended, new discoveries will still be made from the data it returned for years to come, and the discoveries will no doubt inform future missions to these worlds and others like them.

When it entered orbit around the asteroid Vesta, it became the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid in the zone where most solar system asteroids reside, the main belt, between Mars and Jupiter. After leaving Vesta, the satellite journeyed on to the dwarf planet Ceres, becoming the first spacecraft to visit and then orbit a dwarf planet and the first spacecraft to orbit two extraterrestrial targets. But the journey wasn't smooth. Along the way, the spacecraft lost three of the four reaction wheels that kept it oriented in space. Nonetheless, Dawn successfully concluded its primary mission to study both extraterrestrial targets in 2016. Dawn ran out of fuel on Nov. 1, 2018, NASA announced, but the spacecraft will continue to orbit Ceres for another 50 years. \"Today, we celebrate the end of our Dawn mission - its incredible technical achievements, the vital science it gave us and the entire team who enabled the spacecraft to make these discoveries,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C., said in a statement when the mission ended. \"The astounding images and data that Dawn collected from Vesta and Ceres are critical to understanding the history and evolution of our solar system.\" Out of this world: Dawn launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sept. 27, 2007. After traveling 1.7 billion miles (2.8 billion kilometers), the spacecraft arrived at the asteroid Vesta on July 16, 2011. Dawn spent almost a year in orbit around Vesta, the second-largest object in the asteroid belt. On Sept. 5, 2012, Dawn left Vesta and began its track toward the dwarf planet, Ceres, another 3.1 billion miles (4.9 billion km) away. On March 6, 2015, Dawn entered orbit around Ceres. Ceres is by far the most massive object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, weighing in at nearly two-thirds the total mass of the belt. Its massive size and roundness mean it qualifies as a dwarf planet. Unlike a full-size planet, a dwarf planet is a round object that fails to clear out its orbit of smaller objects. Dawn was just barely the first mission to arrive at a dwarf planet; NASA's New Horizons mission zipped by Pluto only a few months later (New Horizons launched before Dawn but had much farther to travel). Boosted by an ion propulsion system, the spacecraft took four days to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) at maximum throttle. Each engine produced only about the same amount of force as a single piece of notebook paper pressed against your hand. Over time, however, that small force adds up. In 2010, Dawn surpassed the previous record for velocity change held by NASA's Deep Space 1 when its accumulated acceleration over the mission exceeded 9,600 mph (4.3 km per second). \"I am delighted that it will be Dawn that surpasses DS1's record,\" Marc Rayman, the chief engineer for the Dawn mission and previous project manager for Deep Space 1, said in a statement. \"It is a tribute to all those involved in the design and operations of this remarkable spacecraft.\" Exploring Vesta: Dawn's first stop was Vesta, a rocky asteroid and the second largest inhabitant of the asteroid belt. Images captured by Dawn allowed scientists to discover the \"exotic and diverse\" geologic landscape of Vesta. Researchers used data collected by Dawn to compile the first map of the asteroid, which is 330 miles (530 km) wide. Dawn's research team discovered that Vesta has a layered structure like Earth. The spacecraft also revealed that Vesta has a substantial nickel-iron core, just like Mercury, Earth and Mars. The core makes up about 18 percent of Vesta's total mass. The surface is entirely basalt, a type of frozen lava, and the asteroid once boasted a magnetic field. Dawn also confirmed that Vesta is the source of the howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites found on Earth and Mars. The HEDs likely came from an impact basin the Dawn team named Rheasilvia. The basin itself is around 1 billion years old and formed from a massive collision that stripped the away the bulk of the asteroid's southern hemisphere. With a diameter of 310 miles (500 km), Rheasilvia is nearly as large as Vesta itself. \"Vesta likely came close to shattering,\" Raymond said in 2012. Research from Dawn also suggests that Vesta may hide ice beneath its surface. Originally, scientists suspected that roughness on the asteroid's surface came from impacts, but Dawn's data suggests that some of those features are caused by ice buried beneath the surface. \"We suggest that modifications of the surface by melting of buried ice could be responsible for smoothing those areas,\" Essam Heggy, a planetary scientist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, told Space.com. \"Buried ice could have been brought to the surface after an impact, which caused heated ice to melt and travel up through the fractures to the surface.\" The findings mean that ice could have played a more dominant role in shaping Vesta than previously thought. \"We went to Vesta to fill in the blanks of our knowledge about the early history of our solar system,\" Christopher Russell, Dawn's principal investigator, said in a statement. \"Dawn has filled in those pages, and more, revealing to us how special Vesta is as a survivor from the earliest days of the solar system. We can now say with certainty that Vesta resembles a small planet more closely than a typical asteroid.\" Ceres science: While Vesta is rocky, Ceres is surprisingly icy. Before Dawn arrived, scientists estimated that water could make up as much as a quarter of the dwarf planet, though that water would be tucked beneath the surface. Observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a cloud of vapor that suggested the dwarf planet might be degassing, though no strong signs of such activity were spotted by Dawn. [Photos: The Changing Bright Spots of Dwarf Planet Ceres] On the surface, Ceres appears relatively bland. Aside from a few craters, the only outstanding feature is a single mountain, Ahuna Mons. Researchers suspected the mountain was a cryovolcano, oozing ice instead of hot lava. Further studies revealed that, while it may be thought of as a \"lonely mountain\" today, it could have had companions in the past. Made of ice, these mountains may have slowly flowed back onto the surface. \"We think we have a very good case that there have been lots of cryovolcanoes on Ceres but they have deformed,\" Dawn researcher Michael Sori of the University of Arizona in Tucson said in a statement. The same fate may await the lonely volcano. \"Ahuna Mons is at most 200 million years old. It just hasn't had time to deform,\" Sori said. \"That was something we had not expected,\" Russell told Space.com. \"The carbonates are a very strong indication of the processes now that we believe took place in the interior, that makes it more Earthlike, when it can alter the chemistry inside.\"From a distance, Dawn caught sight of bright spots that soon resolved into more than 130 bright patches, most of them tied to craters. Initially thought to be Epsom salt, the patches turned out to be carbonate salts, which only form in the presence of water. Since water skips to gas almost immediately on the dwarf planet's surface, the discovery of carbonates suggested that there was liquid beneath the dwarf planet's crust. The flowing ice that formed Ahuna Mons and the presence of salts suggest that an ancient ocean once lay beneath the crust of Ceres. \"We believe these bright spots are a sign that Ceres once had a global ocean,\" Lynnae Quick, a planetary geologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., told Space.com. That ocean may continue to feed activity on Ceres today. \"It's possible there is still brine coming up to the surface,\" Nathan Stein, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, told Space.com. \"It's certainly intriguing.\" Researchers also spotted ammonia-rich clays on the dwarf planet. Ammonia is more commonly found in the outer solar system. The material could have been delivered to Ceres by comets, or its presence could be a sign that the dwarf planet formed in the outer solar system. These and other discoveries by Dawn have revealed that Ceres is a rich, evolving world. Dawn's twilight phase: Although the spacecraft is out of fuel, Dawn will continue to orbit Ceres for decades. Planetary-protection rules require that at least 20 years go by before the spacecraft is allowed to crash into the dwarf planet, to reduce the chances of contamination. The Dawn team opted to set the spacecraft on an orbit that would keep it aloft for at least 50 years.", "url": "https://www.space.com/40454-dawn-mission.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA And ESA Consider Sample Return Missions To Dwarf Planet Ceres", "date": "2019-08-31", "content": " Both NASA and the European Space Agency are independently talking about launching sample return missions to the dwarf planet Ceres by decade's end. With an orbit on the inner edge of the Main Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ceres was studied extensively by NASA's Dawn mission orbiter in 2015 and found to be even more intriguing than previously thought. Such a sample return mission has taken on renewed emphasis since advances in spacecraft robotics can now easily get us there and back again. Thus, a new white paper published as part of ESA's Voyage-2050 survey advocates launching a sample return mission sooner rather than later. Now known to contain large amounts of subsurface water ice, it has had enough rich chemistry and volcanism to have spawned microbial life. Organic compounds have been found distributed extensively across Ceres' surface along with evidence for past habitable surface environments. There's even evidence that Ceres may still have some spots of liquid water at its surface. \"The amount of liquid is not well constrained,\" Julie Castillo-Rogez, NASA's Dawn mission's project scientist and a planetary geophysicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told me. \"It could just be pockets of brines, seas on regional scales, or just a tiny fraction of liquid in a rocky matrix.\" Ceres, which only has a diameter of some 950 km, may curiously have once hosted a mudball interior that could have persisted over billions of years, says Castillo-Rogez. Such an interior would consist of a vast liquid layer several hundred km thick loaded in rock particles. Currently, Ceres has an ice crust, says Castillo-Rogez. But below this ice crust, there may still be a mudball mixture of liquid and rock. A sample return mission would help planetary scientists not only look for signs of life but better understand Ceres' fascinating geology. In order to do a detailed analysis of organic compounds, mineralogy, or age determination, we need high-precision measurements which can only be done in laboratories, Xian Shi, the ESA white paper's lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Gottingen, Germany told me. Some of the samples could even be stored for later use when more capable facilities become available, says Castillo-Rogez. Ceres may still be geologically-active. However, because Ceres' interior is so cold, any volcanics on the dwarf planet is most likely of the 'cryo' variety, meaning that instead of erupting molten silicates, a volcano on Ceres would spew methane, ammonia, liquid water, and sulfur dioxide. Castillo-Rogez says that there is evidence that Ceres has had volcanic activity at Occator Crater and at the 4000-meter ice volcano Ahuna Mons. The ESA white paper calls for a 2029 launch with a 2032 gravitational assist Mars flyby. The spacecraft would actually arrive at Ceres in 2034. The sample capsule's return trajectory would take longer than the spacecraft's outbound trip to Ceres. That's because unlike the outbound portion of the mission, the sample return spacecraft would not be able to use a planetary gravity assist to give it a boost back to Earth. The return spacecraft would also likely carry a less powerful propulsion system. Assuming the return cruise took some five years, it would be the early 2040s before a Ceres sample would likely reach Earth, says Shi. It's way too early to define where the sample return capsule would land, says Castillo-Rogez. But she says usually such sample return capsules land in deserts so that they can be readily spotted and retrieved. The elevation has been exaggerated by a factor of two. The view was made using enhanced-color images from NASA's Dawn mission. A prime sample return goal would be to definitively determine where Ceres actually formed and how its formation location relates to the current debate over where Earth got its water. NASA's Dawn orbiter detected ammonia on Ceres' surface which is indicative of the dwarf planet having formed much farther out in our solar system. No one knows exactly where, but likely beyond the so-called ice line, which in the early life of a solar system is the distance at which volatile compounds such as water, ammonia, and methane can condense into ice crystals. After Earth, Ceres is the most water-rich object in the inner solar system. \"So, it is likely out of place and probably formed in the outer solar system,\" said Castillo-Rogez. \"If Ceres migrated inward, that implies the other icy asteroids migrated from giant planet regions and were the main source of water to Earth.\" ", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2019/08/31/nasa-and-esa-considering-sample-return-missions-to-dwarf-planet-ceres/"}]}]
