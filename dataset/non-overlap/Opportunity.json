Running nine days late because of bad weather, insulation problems and battery trouble on the Boeing-built Delta 2, Opportunity roared away from launch complex 17B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 11:18:15 p.m. EDT, NASA's second Mars launch in less than a month. \"It's been a very clean, very successful launch,\" said NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe, dropping in on reporters at a press site near the launch pad. \"We've now got two rovers on the way to Mars.\" Initial data from the spacecraft as it began its seven-month cruise to Mars showed all systems operating normally after a flawless climb to space. \"All subsystems are reporting everything is in healthy shape,\" said deputy project manager Richard Brace. \"We're in a power safe state, so we're getting power from the solar panels and charging the batteries. ... We're good.\" The slender Delta 2 screamed off the launching pad with an unfamiliar rush of speed thanks to a set of beefy Delta 3-class solid-fuel boosters needed to provide enough power to reach the red planet as Earth and Mars slowly change position in their orbits around the sun. This was the first launch of a so-called Delta 2 \"Heavy,\" but it appeared to go off without a hitch. Passing through the sound barrier 30 seconds after liftoff, the rocket arced eastward over the Atlantic Ocean and quickly disappeared from view. Eighty-three minutes after launch, the Opportunity spacecraft separated from the Delta's third stage rocket motor to begin its long cruise to Mars. NASA's Spirit rover, launched June 10 and now millions of miles from Earth, is scheduled to reach Mars on Jan. 4. Using a parachute-airbag landing system similar to the one that successfully delivered NASA's Mars Pathfinder to the surface in 1997, Spirit is targeted for a \"bounce-down\" landing in Gusev Crater, a 100-mile-wide depression where scientists believe water once pooled. Opportunity is bound for the opposite side of the planet, landing in a region known as Meridiani Planum on Jan. 25. Orbital analysis shows high concentrations of hematite in the area, a mineral that usually forms in the presence of water. Opportunity's launch originally was targeted for June 28, but the flight was delayed at the last minute because of range safety issues and high-altitude winds. During turnaround operations, technicians discovered debonded insulation on the first stage of the Delta 2. The insulation was installed to keep the skin of the rocket cool during its faster-than-normal climb out of the lower atmosphere. In the end, it took a week to correct the problem. Launch was delayed an additional day, from Sunday to Monday, because of work to replace a battery in the rocket's self-destruct system. As if that wasn't enough, the countdown ticked down to within seconds of liftoff tonight when problems with a sluggish first stage fill-and-drain valve forced yet another delay. But this time around, the problem was corrected in time to make a second instantaneous launch window at 11:18 p.m. \"It's almost Murphy. Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong,\" joked NASA launch manager Omar Baez. But when all was said and done, \"the flight did well. We're looking very good, it's been a very nice flight for the inaugural flight of the 7920 (Delta 2) heavy. It's a very important mission for the agency.\" NASA only had until July 15 to get Opportunity off the ground before standing down for four years while Earth and Mars returned to favorable launch positions. NASA managers no doubt breathed a sigh of relief when the Delta 2 finally roared to life this evening, 12 minutes before Mars rose on the eastern horizon. \"These missions are not designed to find life on Mars,\" said NASA science chief Edward Weiler. \"They're not designed to find water on Mars. They are designed to answer a critical question in the search for life. We know Mars had water, we know it had it in the past, it may have it in the present. What we don't know is how long this water existed in place and how long it stayed there. If it stayed there for tens of millions of years, there's a good chance that life might have evolved. Because on Earth, wherever we find water, energy and organic compounds, we find life. No matter what the conditions are.\" Principal investigator Steve Squyres, a Cornell University geologist, said launching two identical rovers to opposite sides of Mars will double the odds of success and provide a potentially mind-boggling scientific bonanza. \"The science objectives of the MER (Mars Exploration Rover) project is fundamentally to determine whether or not Mars ever had conditions at its surface that would have been capable of supporting life,\" he said Friday. \"It's about habitability, was the planet once a habitable place? \"It's not very inviting today. It's cold, 60 degrees below zero, it's a very dry place. If you took all the water vapor in the martian atmosphere and condensed it out on the surface, you'd make a layer about a hundreth of a millimeter thick. It is a desolate, dry, barren world today. \"Yet when we look at Mars from orbit, we see these tantalizing clues that it was once warmer and wetter,\" Squyres said. \"We see dried up river valleys, we see dried up lakebeds, we see mineral deposits that are the signatures of minerals that might have been deposited in liquid water. So we've got all these tantalizing clues that it used to be different. And more than that, it appears it may have been different back three, three-and-a-half, four billion years ago, the same period of time when somehow life was coming into being from non-living material on this planet. \"So it immediately begs the question, if it happened here under warm, wet conditions, and it was warm and wet there at the same time, could it have taken place there as well? So we want to really find out whether or not Mars had what it takes, whether it had the conditions necessary to support life. Now in order to do that, what you need is you need a robot field geologist. And that is what this machine is all about.\" Spirit and Opportunity are both equipped with high-resolution stereo cameras mounted on a five-and-a-half-foot-tall boom that will provide the equivalent of 20-20 views of the surface. \"These are images that would look good projected on an IMAX screen,\" Squyres said. \"These are going to give you a spectacular view of Mars.\" An infrared spectrometer housed in the body of the 384-pound rover will use the same camera boom as a periscope of sorts, helping scientists identify rocks for closer analysis. And both rovers are equipped with ingenious robot arms carrying microscopes, spectrometers and \"rock abrasion tools,\" or RATs, to grind into selected rocks, exposing pristine interiors. Both golf cart-size rovers are expected to travel up to a football field each day, farther than Pathfinder's minuscule Sojourner rover managed over its entire three-month lifetime. \"Spirit is on its way to a place called Gusev crater,\" Squyres said. \"Gusev crater is a big hole in the ground, it's about 100 miles in diameter and it's got a dry river bed flowing into it. There was a lake there. If you can come up with an explanation for a configuration like that with a hole in the ground and a river flowing into it and no lake, I'd like to hear about it. \"The other lander, Opportunity, is going to a place called Meridiani Planum. Meridiani is a marvelous place, it is smooth, it's flat and we think it will be very suitable as a landing site. And most importantly, it has this mineral, coarse, gray hematite. Now hematite is a mineral that forms under a range of conditions on Earth but in almost all circumstances, hematite forms as the result of liquid water. So here we have a place that's like a chemical beacon, visible from space, saying water may have been here. We're going to go there and try to read the record at that site.\" Weiler refers to Mars as the \"death planet\" because so many missions have ended in failure, including two back-to-back NASA missions in 1999. \"Landing on Mars is tough,\" he said. \"We can do everything right, we can spend $400 million as we did on each one of these things and we get a gust of wind that exceeds the limits, which ruins the mission. ... These are pretty quote-unquote 'safe' places to land, but all it takes is a boulder the wrong size, in the wrong place. I mean, I hate to be a nattering nabob of negativism, but if you take a jellied piece of bread and you drop it, which side is it going to land on? So that's why I'm glad we have two rovers. With two rovers, I hope we have one jelly side up.\" And \"if we beat the odds and the missions arrive safely, I think it's safe to bet we'll see the biggest scientific return from another planet that we've ever seen and we'll see some of the most fantastic martian landscapes you can imagine,\" Weiler said. \"But the job is just beginning. It's not time for champagne quite yet.\"", "url": "https://www.spaceflightnow.com/mars/merb/030707launch.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Opportunity rover lands on Mars", "date": "2004-01-25", "content": "Opportunity, the second of two Nasa rovers, has successfully landed on the Martian surface where it will search for signs of water on the planet. The new rover touched down at 0505 GMT, halfway around the Red Planet from where the Spirit rover landed on 4 January. Opportunity landed on a smooth, flat plain, in the highest altitude landing ever attempted by Nasa. Spirit sent back striking colour photos of Mars but stopped working properly on Wednesday. But US space agency scientists now say they are making good progress on fixing Spirit. \"We resurrected one rover and we saw the birth of another. This was one heck of a critical milestone,\" Ed Weiler, associate administrator for space science at Nasa, told a news conference. Opportunity sent images back of its landing site showing an unfamiliar, largely featureless landscape except for a conspicuous outcrop of bedrock nearby. \"This is a beautiful, alien place. A world unlike any we've seen before,\" said Professor Steve Squyres, principal payload investigator. The Martian bedrock has a slab-like form which scientists said could have been created either by volcanic activity or by the action of water. The rover's airbags have made distinctive imprints in the Martian soil, suggesting it may be fine-grained and multi-layered. It is also much darker in colour to the soil at Spirit's Gusev Crater landing site. \"I said the soil at Gusev had some strange characteristics. That pales in comparison to this stuff,\" said Professor Squyres.

NASA officials are delighted at the second successful landing on Mars in a month. Opportunity's twin rover, Spirit, landed Jan. 4 on the other side of the planet. Spirit has experienced software difficulties, but NASA engineers are slowly solving them, as NPR's Joe Palca reports. After several days of round-the-clock work on Spirit, NASA mission managers pulled away Saturday to focus on Opportunity. It bounced down on schedule shortly after midnight on the U.S. East Coast to cheers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Spirit began malfunctioning earlier this week, going silent at times and sending back junk data at others. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif., have re-established successful communications with Spirit, but are still unsure about the cause of the rover's malfunction. Mission managers say the problems with Spirit will make them even more conservative about operating Opportunity. But they're delighted at Sunday's prompt response from the second robotic explorer.

Opportunity rolled forward about 11 feet (3.5 meters) on Thursday, leaving it closer to an outcrop of rocks that scientists want to spend days studying. It was the first time the rover had moved since leaving its lander Saturday. Scientists planned for Opportunity to roll 5 more feet (1.5 meters) Friday. That should put the slabs of bedrock within reach of the rover's robotic arm, although a little \"scoot\" may be needed to move Opportunity even closer, Larry Soderblom of the U.S. Geological Survey said. Scientists skipped plans for the rover to conduct more soil tests on the way to the outcrop, opting instead to reach as quickly as possible a feature on the rocks they have nicknamed \"Snout.\" Spirit back to work: On the far side of the planet, the twin rover Spirit resumed its science work Thursday after being stalled for two weeks with software problems, project manager Pete Theisinger said. Plans called for it to brush off and examine the surface of a volcanic rock, he said. Spirit could begin rolling again by the weekend, moving toward a crater 800 feet (250 meters) away that could take a month to reach. The software problems have stymied its half of the $820 million double mission to find evidence that the planet was once a wetter place. Scientists planned for Opportunity to spend several days at Snout, and then spend several more driving alongside the band of rocks, Soderblom said. Then Opportunity may turn its attention to the Martian soil, spinning one of its front wheels to dig into a spot rich in the iron-bearing mineral hematite. Opportunity previously looked at a patch of soil elsewhere in its crater that contained very little of the iron oxide, which typically forms in liquid water. NASA also has pinpointed where Opportunity landed, Theisinger said. The rover sits inside a shallow depression about 2,300 feet (700 meters) west of a larger crater, he said. Spirit landed on Mars on Jan. 3, followed three weeks later by Opportunity. As of Thursday, NASA recorded 5.4 billion hits on its Mars mission-related Web sites, Theisinger said. The number has grown steadily by 100 million hits a day, he added.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4192485"}, {"title": "OPPORTUNITY ENTERS ENDURANCE CRATER", "date": "2004-06-11", "content": "After spending a month driving around the rim of the 130-meter-wide Endurance Crater, NASA's Opportunity rover rolled cautiously down its slope on Wednesday. Mission scientists are eager to examine the interior of Endurance because deeper, older layers of rock are exposed inside. \"As we approached it, it became more and more exciting,\" says mission scientist Ray Arvidson (Washington University in St. Louis). \"There's a section of this relatively bright evaporitic rock and then it's sitting on an older section of what appears to be basaltic sandstone that's also crossbedded.\" Crossbedding is the interweaving of layers characteristic of sedimentary rocks formed either beneath flowing water or in the presence of winds. The scale of the crossbedding inside Endurance is more characteristic of sand dunes formed through wind action, Arvidson says, but he is not ruling out water. \"It could be that these are very large ripples in an oceanic environment,\" he says. The rover's target inside Endurance is an outcrop named Karatepe just six or seven meters inside the crater rim, where the older, basaltic sandstone appears to be poking through the surface layer of younger sedimentary rock. Mission planners chose this location because the path leading from the rim has a shallow, 20\u00b0 slope and is composed mostly of flat rock, which provides better traction than sand. Opportunity reached the rim of Endurance in late April. Mission scientists have been imaging the crater since then and trying to find a safe path to the interior. They also investigated rocks near the rim, including one dubbed Pyrrho that has a rippled surface possibly indicating past water interactions. Managers agonized for weeks over the decision to send Opportunity into Endurance, because it might never get back out. To explore the risks, engineers built a test bed of rock and sand that can be tilted at different angles and drove a test rover around on its surface. If Opportunity's path to Karatepe turns out to be steeper or sandier than expected, the rover may not get enough traction to climb out. Mission planners are crossing their fingers, because there are tantalizing targets outside the crater they would dearly like to investigate. They especially want to drive the rover south to inspect the vast \"etch terrain\" where the hematite-rich surface has been carved away, exposing some other, brighter material. The mission's engineers, for their part, are eager to visit Opportunity's discarded heat shield, which lies about 450 meters from its landing site, to see how the descent through the thin Martian atmosphere affected it.", "url": "https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/opportunity-enters-endurance-crater/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Opportunity Catches its Shadow", "date": "2004-08-02", "content": "This self-portrait of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity comes courtesy of the Sun and the rover's front hazard-avoidance camera.

Duringits January 25 plunge toward the red planet, the Opportunityrover was encapsulated in a protective aeroshell comprised of two key parts: aheat shield and a backshell that contained essential landing gear. Aftertaking the brunt of atmospheric friction, the heat shield was jettisoned high aboveMars. The hardware fell several miles before hitting the Meridiani Planumlandscape at a smashing speed. Freshfrom exploring the remarkable Endurance Crater, the Opportunity rover is nowrolling toward the beat up heat shield that's been sitting on Mars for nearly11 months. Steve Squyres, scientific Principal Investigatorfor the Mars Exploration Rover effort from CornellUniversity, said the Opportunityassessment of the heat shield offers a double-bonus. \"For thescientists, it may be a chance to look at the deepest fresh hole in the groundthat we'll ever see on Mars. For the engineers, it's an unprecedented chance tosee how a heat shield performed during entry through the martianatmosphere. There's something for everybody,\" Squyres told SPACE.com.

This latter set ofexperiments will allow us to probe subsurface characteristics,\" Arvidsonexplained. First-ever inspection: Spacecraftengineers are keen on making the first-ever inspection of a heat shield thatpenetrated Mars' atmosphere. Lockheed Martin SpaceSystems in Denver, Colorado designed and built the MarsExploration Rover aeroshell structure and thermal protection system. The blunt-nosed cone of a heatshield was covered with a layer of phenolic honeycomb. A phenolic compound ismade from benzene and is typically used in various plastics, disinfectants, andpharmaceuticals. This phenolic honeycomb is filled with an ablative material --also called an ablator -- which dissipates heat generated by atmosphericfriction. Theablator itself is a unique blend of cork wood, binder and many tiny silicaglass spheres. The heat shield hasa thick, one-half inch (12.7 millimeter) layer of the ablator.

Looming large for the Opportunity rover at Meridiani Planum is Victoria Crater - a grand bit of territory that's roughly half a mile (800 meters) in diameter. That's about six times wider than Endurance Crater, a feature that the rover previously surveyed for several months in 2004, gathering data on rock layers there that were affected by water of long, long ago. \"We are closing in ... we've got only about a kilometer to go now,\" said Cornell University's Steve Squyres, lead scientist for the twin Mars exploration rovers. \"Feel free to work out your own guess at an estimated time of arrival based on our recent progress ... but I'm not making any predictions! Mars has fooled us too many times before,\" Squyres told Space.com. Lay of the land: Pushing across Meridiani Planum has not been easy for Opportunity. The landscape is one of rolling ripples of sand and splashes of outcrop rock. \"We're pushing as hard as we can with a very old rover,\" Squyres added. \"We'll get there when and if we get there.\" Once there, Squyres said that the plan is to approach that feature much as they did Endurance Crater. \"[We'll] start by taking images from several points along the rim to get the lay of the land ... and then see if there's a place where we can enter the crater safely,\" Squyres said. \"There's no guarantee that we'll be able to get in, of course, but we're not driving all this way just for the view.\" Rim shots: Also anxiously awaiting Opportunity's hoped-for wheeling up to Victoria Crater is William Farrand, a research scientist at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. He is a member of the Mars Exploration Rover science team. \"The rover has been making good progress towards Victoria Crater. So - knock on wood - it should get there perhaps as early as late July,\" Farrand told Space.com. \"We will be getting just amazing images when we get to the rim of Victoria Crater.\" Farrand said the views at that feature are sure to be spectacular. But the real payoff, he added, is to check out the exposures of outcrop that the science team is expecting to see on the inner walls of Victoria Crater.  \"Opportunity's mission has been all about reading the story contained within the layered rocks that lie just below the surface of Meridiani Planum,\" Farrand advised. \"We got about 40 to 50 centimeters of outcrop at Eagle Crater [at the start of its roving], and then 7 meters at Endurance Crater.\" However, it looks as if there's an even deeper story at Victoria. Images taken from Mars orbit suggest something like 65 feet (20 meters) of outcrop might be exposed in the walls of Victoria Crater, Farrand stated.

The rover was expected to drive for 24 metres but only made it 1.5 m, as its wheels churned in the soft soil. To escape, the rover drove backwards for 5 to 28 centimetres each day. And at 0600 EDT (1000 GMT) on Tuesday, mission managers learned that the strategy had worked - all six of the rovers' wheels were back on solid bedrock. Rover officials do not yet know what caused the wheels to get stuck, but they planned to turn Opportunity's cameras back on the trouble spot on Tuesday to find out more. And they have decided to name the sand trap \"Jammerbugt\", which translates to \"Bay of Lamentation\" in Danish. \"It's a bay on the northwest coast of Denmark that historically has been the site of many shipwrecks,\" Steve Squyres, the rovers' principal investigator and a planetary scientist at Cornell University in New York, US, told New Scientist. Slip checks: The rover team will continue to use Danish names for any new features it discovers in the next several weeks, in honour of the country's contributions to the mission. Several Danes work on the rover and Danish institutions provided instruments to study magnetic minerals in the Red Planet's soil, rocks and atmospheric dust. Denmark also celebrated its Constitution Day on Monday. This is not the first time Opportunity has become trapped on Mars. It got stuck in another location, nicknamed \"Purgatory Dune\", in April 2005, and was delayed for five weeks.

The decision to leave came after one of the rover's six wheels seemed to show an early sign of failure - a scenario that could have trapped the rover inside the crater forever. Opportunity descended into the 800-metre-wide crater in September 2007, after skirting its rim for a year before that. It found that the layers of rocks exposed in the crater's walls are like those it had seen elsewhere in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars - sulphate sandstones. These rocks are thought to have formed when sand dunes came into contact with water and cemented into solid rocks. The crater was deeper than any the rover had explored previously. So scientists hoped to study the exposed rock layers to trace how the geological conditions in which the layers formed - such as the level or chemistry of the subsurface water table - changed over time. \"What we were really interested in seeing in Victoria is whether as you went down deeper - which takes you back farther in time - there could be a systematic change in the trace chemistry of the rocks,\" says Bruce Banerdt, rover project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Over the last year, the rover had studied layers of rock about 6 metres thick at close range, and that data is still being analysed.

Opportunity used its own entry tracks from nearly a year ago as the path for a drive of 6.8 meters (22 feet) bringing the rover out over the top of the inner slope and through a sand ripple at the lip of Victoria Crater. The exit drive, conducted late Thursday, completed a series of drives covering 50 meters (164 feet) since the rover team decided about a month ago that it had completed its scientific investigations inside the crater. \"We're headed to the next adventure out on the plains of Meridiani,\" said JPL's John Callas, project manager for Opportunity and its twin Mars rover, Spirit. \"We safely got into the crater, we completed our exploration there, and we safely got out.

The rover climbed out of Victoria Crater earlier this month. \"We may not get there, but it is scientifically the right direction to go anyway,\" said Steve Squyres of Cornell University, principal investigator for the science instruments on Opportunity and its twin rover, Spirit. \"This crater is staggeringly large compared to anything we've seen before.\" Getting there would yield a look inside a bowl 13.7 miles across. Scientists expect to see a much deeper stack of rock layers than those examined by Opportunity in Victoria Crater. \"I would love to see that view from the rim,\" Squyres said. \"But even if we never get there, as we move southward we expect to be getting to younger and younger layers of rock on the surface. Also, there are large craters to the south that we think are sources of cobbles that we want to examine out on the plain. Some of the cobbles are samples of layers deeper than Opportunity will ever see, and we expect to find more cobbles as we head toward the south.\" Opportunity will have to pick up the pace to get there. The rover team estimates Opportunity may be able to travel about 110 yards each day it is driven toward the Endeavour crater. Even at that pace, the journey could take two years. \"This is a bolder, more aggressive objective than we have had before,\" said John Callas, the project manager for both Mars rovers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"It's tremendously exciting. It's new science. It's the next great challenge for these robotic explorers.\" Opportunity, like Spirit, is well past its expected lifetime on Mars, and might not keep working long enough to reach the crater. However, two new resources not available during the 4-mile drive toward Victoria Crater in 2005 and 2006 are expected to aid in this new trek. One is imaging from orbit of details smaller than the rover itself, using the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which arrived at the Red Planet in 2006. \"HiRISE allows us to identify drive paths and potential hazards on the scale of the rover along the route,\" Callas said. \"This is a great example of how different parts of NASA's Mars Exploration Program reinforce each other.\" Other advantages come from a new version of flight software uplinked to Opportunity and Spirit in 2006, boosting their ability to autonomously choose routes and avoid hazards such as sand dunes. During its first year on Mars, Opportunity found geological evidence that the area where it landed had surface and underground water in the distant past. The rover's explorations since have added information about how that environment changed over time.

Now, Opportunity's computer can examine images that the rover takes with its wide-angle navigation camera after a drive, and recognize rocks that meet specified criteria, such as rounded shape or light color. It can then center its narrower-angle panoramic camera on the chosen target and take multiple images through color filters. \"It's a way to get some bonus science,\" said Tara Estlin of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. She is a rover driver, a senior member of JPL's Artificial Intelligence Group and leader of development for this new software system. The new system is called Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science, or AEGIS. Without it, follow-up observations depend on first transmitting the post-drive navigation camera images to Earth for ground operators to check for targets of interest to examine on a later day. Because of time and data-volume constraints, the rover team may opt to drive the rover again before potential targets are identified or before examining targets that aren't highest priority. The first images taken by a Mars rover choosing its own target show a rock about the size of a football, tan in color and layered in texture. It appears to be one of the rocks tossed outward onto the surface when an impact dug a nearby crater. Opportunity pointed its panoramic camera at this unnamed rock after analyzing a wider-angle photo taken by the rover's navigation camera at the end of a drive on March 4. Opportunity decided that this particular rock, out of more than 50 in the navigation camera photo, best met the criteria that researchers had set for a target of interest: large and dark. \"It found exactly the target we would want it to find,\" Estlin said. \"This checkout went just as we had planned, thanks to many people's work, but it's still amazing to see Opportunity performing a new autonomous activity after more than six years on Mars.\" Opportunity can use the new software at stopping points along a single day's drive or at the end of the day's drive. This enables it to identify and examine targets of interest that might otherwise be missed. \"We spent years developing this capability on research rovers in the Mars Yard here at JPL,\" said Estlin. \"Six years ago, we never expected that we would get a chance to use it on Opportunity.\" The developers anticipate that the software will be useful for narrower field-of-view instruments on future rovers.

Opportunity arrived at Mars' Santa Maria crater in the last few days, and it should make it to the crater's southeast rim in a few weeks. Once there, it will investigate a patch of minerals that likely formed in the presence of water billions of years ago, researchers said here on Thursday during a press conference at the 2010 fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union. The rover knows where to look thanks to NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which detected the minerals, known as hydrated sulfates, from 150 miles (250 kilometers) up while circling the Red Planet. This level of teamwork between rover and spacecraft is unprecedented, researchers said. \"It's the first time we've used minerals detected from orbit to drive where a rover should go,\" said Mars Exploration Rover deputy principal investigator Ray Arvidson, of Washington University in St. Louis. The rim of Santa Maria: MRO detected the hydrated sulfates on Santa Maria's rim using its mineral-mapping spectrometer. Opportunity wasn't too far away, so the rover team decided to send the rover over for a closer look, researchers said. The Martian surface is bone-dry today, but hydrated sulfates and clays which also form in the presence of water reveal that the planet was once a much wetter place. But that was long ago; scientists think the clays are 4 to 4.5 billion years old and the hydrated sulfates are about 3.8 billion years old. Craters provide a way for scientists to probe such ancient rocks, which would otherwise remain buried and out of reach. \"These are nature's drills to expose the bedrock,\" Arvidson said. And Santa Maria is special as far as craters go, he added. The crater appears to be extremely young in the geological scheme of things perhaps just a few million years old, Arvidson told Space.com - so its surface hasn't been too grimed over by weathering. \"We've never seen a crater this fresh, this big,\" Arvidson said.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna40709689"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Mars rover snapped on edge of crater", "date": "2011-03-10", "content": "Nasa's Opportunity rover is little more than a bluish speck on the rim of the Santa Maria crater on the surface of Mars in an image taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's high resolution camera.

While poking around Endeavour's rim recently, it found the mineral vein, which is about 20 inches (51 centimeters) long and about the width of a human thumb.

Eight years and 2,922 Earth-days later, Opportunity continues its mission of exploration of the Martian surface, unlocking the mysteries of Mars and serving as a symbol of endurance while paving the way for future human missions to the Red Planet. Gearing up for an ambitious mission on Mars: Like its twin rover, Spirit, Opportunity's mission was based on 90-solar day mission on surface of Mars. A solar day is based on planetary Mars timekeeping based on Mars' orbital rotation rate. A solar day on Mars is clocked at 24 hours 39 minutes 35.24409 seconds. Compared to Earth's 24 hour 00 minute 00.002 second solar day length, the difference in the Earth-Mars solar day results in the Martian solar day lasting 2.7% longer than Earth's with a conversation factor of 1.027491 days to sols. Thus, since landing on Mars, Opportunity has operated for 2,844 sols, equivalent to 2,922 standard Earth days (Earth sols). In turn, this long-duration mission puts Opportunity 2,754 sols over its predicted and planned 90 sol-day mission - meaning that Opportunity has functioned 30.6 times longer than anticipated as the rover and its mission control team celebrates its 8th Earth-year anniversary on Mars. Over these 8 Earth-years on Mars, Opportunity has searched for scientific knowledge based on its original mission objectives, including the search for and characteristic of rocks and soils. Other objectives of Opportunity's ongoing mission include the determination of the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing site (and beyond, at this point); determination of what geologic processes have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry, including water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering; and the performance calibration and validation of surface observations of Mars made by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey the Martian geology from orbit. Moreover, Opportunity's objectives have and continue to revolve around the search for iron-containing minerals, including the identification and quantification of the relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water; the characterization of the mineralogy and textures of rocks and soils to determine the processes that created them; the search for geological clues to the environmental conditions that existed when liquid water was present; and the assessment of whether the past Martian environment was conducive for life. To accomplish the tasks given to it, Opportunity was truly built to last. At a height of 4.9 ft, a width of 7.5 ft, and a length of 5.2 ft, the six-wheeled utility craft was constructed to power itself via solar panels installed on its \"back.\"  These solar panels, at peak operating condition (clear of Martian dust and dirt), were designed to produce 140 watts of power for four hours per day. The energy produced from the solar panels is then transferred to the Opportunity's lithium ion batteries for storage and distribution - thus allowing the rover to conserve power when not needed and use energy during non-sunlit portions of the day. Weighing in a 400 lbs, the craft was built with mobility in mind, needing to not only drive itself to specific locations determined by its control team, but also to navigate around obstacles while driving toward specific targets of interest. Thus, each wheel on Opportunity was given its own motor as well as steering at the front and rear drive sections. With a maximum speed of 2 in/s (with an average speed about one-fifth of this), Opportunity was also built with the ability to navigate grades on the Martian surface of up to 30 degrees. Opportunity was also affixed with nine scientific experiments, including a panoramic camera to examine the texture, color, mineralogy, and structure of the local Martian terrain; a navigation camera for driving purposes; the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer to identify \"promising rocks and soil\" for examination; and two Hazcams with 120 degree views for \"additional data about its surroundings.\" Opportunity's robotic arm was fixed with the Mossbauer spectrometer for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils; the Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer for close-up analysis of the abundances of elements that make up rocks and soils; magnets for collects magnetic dust particles; a Microscopic Imager for close-up, high-resolution images of rocks and soils; and the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) to expose fresh rock material for examination by instruments on-board the rover.", "url": "https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/01/opportunitys-eight-years-mars-story-science-endurance/"}, {"title": "Opportunity Looks Back After Hop to a New Pad Space Wallpaper", "date": "2012-04-17", "content": "In this space wallpaper,Rover makes progress on long trek to Endeavour Crater.

Spherical objects concentrated at an outcrop Opportunity reached last week differ in several ways from iron-rich spherules nicknamed \"blueberries\" the rover found at its landing site in early 2004 and at many other locations to date. Opportunity is investigating an outcrop called Kirkwood in the Cape York segment of the western rim of Endeavour Crater. The spheres measure as much as one-eighth of an inch (3 millimeters) in diameter. The analysis is still preliminary, but it indicates that these spheres do not have the high iron content of Martian blueberries. \"This is one of the most extraordinary pictures from the whole mission,\" said Opportunity's principal investigator, Steve Squyres of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. \"Kirkwood is chock full of a dense accumulation of these small spherical objects. Of course, we immediately thought of the blueberries, but this is something different. We never have seen such a dense accumulation of spherules in a rock outcrop on Mars.\" The Martian blueberries found elsewhere by Opportunity are concretions formed by action of mineral-laden water inside rocks, evidence of a wet environment on early Mars. Concretions result when minerals precipitate out of water to become hard masses inside sedimentary rocks. Many of the Kirkwood spheres are broken and eroded by the wind. Where wind has partially etched them away, a concentric structure is evident. Opportunity used the microscopic imager on its arm to look closely at Kirkwood. Researchers checked the spheres' composition by using an instrument called the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer on Opportunity's arm. \"They seem to be crunchy on the outside, and softer in the middle,\" Squyres said. \"They are different in concentration. They are different in structure. They are different in composition. They are different in distribution. So, we have a wonderful geological puzzle in front of us. We have multiple working hypotheses, and we have no favorite hypothesis at this time. It's going to take a while to work this out, so the thing to do now is keep an open mind and let the rocks do the talking.\" Just past Kirkwood lies another science target area for Opportunity. The location is an extensive pale-toned outcrop in an area of Cape York where observations from orbit have detected signs of clay minerals. That may be the rover's next study site after Kirkwood. Four years ago, Opportunity departed Victoria Crater, which it had investigated for two years, to reach different types of geological evidence at the rim of the much larger Endeavour Crater. The rover's energy levels are favorable for the investigations. Spring equinox comes this month to Mars' southern hemisphere, so the amount of sunshine for solar power will continue increasing for months. \"The rover is in very good health considering its 8-1/2 years of hard work on the surface of Mars,\" said Mars Exploration Rover Project Manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Energy production levels are comparable to what they were a full Martian year ago, and we are looking forward to productive spring and summer seasons of exploration.\" NASA launched the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity in the summer of 2003, and both completed their three-month prime missions in April 2004.

The Opportunity rover, which landed on Mars in January 2004 along with its twin, Spirit, is currenlty studying clay deposits on the rim of the Red Planet's Endeavour Crater. The clays imply that the area was exposed to relatively neutral - as opposed to harshly acidic or basic - water long ago, researchers said. \"This is our first glimpse ever at conditions on ancient Mars that clearly show us a chemistry that would've been suitable for life at the Opportunity site,\" Opportunity principal investigator Steve Squyres, of Cornell University, told reporters here today (Dec. 4) at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Opportunity didn't just stumble blindly onto the clays. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft spotted them from orbit, leading the rover team to point the golf-cart-size robot toward its current location, which is known as Matijevic Hill. \"From orbit, we have seen the unambiguous infrared spectral signature of clays along the rim of Endeavour Crater,\" Squyres said. \"It was that chemical beacon that drew us.\" Opportunity has already circumnavigated Matijevic Hill, which was named after the late Jake Matijevic, who led the Spirit and Opportunity engineering teams for several years. Such a \"walkaround\" is exactly what a human field geologist would do to get the lay of the land, Squyres said. The rover will likely stay at Matijevic Hill for a while, trying to understand how the clays were laid down billions of years ago, Squyres said. Part of the work will involve investigating mysterious tiny spherules Opportunity has discovered embedded in the clay matrix. The Opportunity team initially thought the BB-size gray spheres were similar to the iron-rich \"blueberries\" that the rover has found elsewhere on the Red Planet. But initial analyses have shown that's not the case, leading Squyres to dub them \"newberries.\" The team isn't sure exactly what the newberries are, or how they formed. \"I think a big part of the story is going to be understanding the newberries,\" Squyres said. \"I think figuring out the newberries is going to be fundamental to understanding how this clay-bearing unit was emplaced.\" Opportunity and Spirit were tasked with three-month prime missions to search for signs of past water activity on Mars.

Opportunity has been investigating rock targets in the western portion of the valley since late July, working its way eastward in a thorough reconnaissance of the area. The rover's panoramic camera has captured a scene dominated by a summit called \"Hinners Point,\" forming part of the valley's northern edge. The image also shows a portion of the valley floor with swirling reddish zones that have been a target for study.  For several months starting in mid- to late October, the rover team plans to operate Opportunity on the southern side of the valley to take advantage of the sun-facing slope. The site is in Mars' southern hemisphere, so the sun is to the north during fall and winter days. Tilting the rover toward the sun increases power output from its solar panels. The shortest-daylight period of this seventh Martian winter for Opportunity will come in January 2016. \"Our expectation is that Opportunity will be able to remain mobile through the winter,\" said Mars Exploration Rover Project Manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.

Rocks in reddish zones there contain more silica and less iron than most rocks in the area. \"We have detective work to do in Marathon Valley for many months ahead,\" said Opportunity Deputy Principal Investigator Ray Arvidson, of Washington University in St. Louis. \"During the Martian late fall and winter seasons Opportunity will conduct its measurements and traverses on the southern side of the valley.

You have to admit that this could easily be used as a background in the next sci-fi blockbuster, and no one would ever know it's actually real.  \"This final panorama embodies what made our Opportunity rover such a remarkable mission of exploration and discovery,\" said Opportunity project manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.", "url": "https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/this-is-the-last-thing-opportunity-saw-on-mars-before-finally-shutting-down-for-good"}, {"title": "A parting panorama from the Opportunity Mars rover caps 15 years", "date": "2019-03-18", "content": "A final panorama from the Opportunity Mars rover, assembled from 354 images captured by the spacecraft's Panoramic Camera, or PANCAM, between 13 May and 10 June 2018 provide a detailed look at the rover's final resting place in Perseverance Valley just below the rim of Endeavour Crater. After nearly 15 years of operation on Mars, Opportunity last contacted flight controllers on Earth that same June 10 as a global dust storm enveloped the red planet, effectively cutting off sunlight at the surface. The solar powered Opportunity's battery drained and the spacecraft never recovered. Click on the labeled image above for a larger view.

Visible in this map is a yellow traverse route beginning at Opportunity's landing site, Eagle Crater, and ranging 28.06 miles to its final resting spot on the rim of Endeavour Crater. The rover was descending down into the crater in Perseverance Valley when the dust storm ended its mission. Drive along with the NASA's Opportunity Mars rover and hear the voices of scientists and engineers behind the mission. Designed to run for 90 days, the exploration spanned more than 15 years from 2004 to 2019. ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/final-traverse-map-for-nasas-opportunity-rover/"}]}]
