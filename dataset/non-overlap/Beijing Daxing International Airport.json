The new airport, which is likely to be approved within the year, will probably have eight runways for civilian use and a ninth for military use, Yao Weihui, general manager of China United Airlines, said at a ceremony marking the delivery of the airline's 10th Boeing plane on Monday. Once the airport in southern Beijing's Daxing district is put into use, the Beijing Nanyuan Airport in the southern Fengtai district, which is used for both military and civilian purposes, will be closed, said Yao, whose airline now uses Nanyuan airport. Sources with the Civil Aviation Administration of China said on Tuesday that the project is yet to be approved by the National Development and Reform Commission, so any detail in the previous plan is subject to change. But Wang Jian, secretary-general of China Civil Airport Association, said on Tuesday that the new airport will have at least four runways for civilian use. With more runways, the new airport will have more capacity to handle the large amount of traffic in and out of Beijing, he said. \"The suggested location (for the new airport) in Daxing district is a place with few residents and buildings, so many runways can be built,\" Wang said, adding the Beijing Capital International Airport in the northeast cannot have a fourth runway because of its location. There has been a plan to build a second airport in the city for years. The new airport will shoulder part of the traffic pressure faced by Beijing Capital International Airport, which is now the world's second largest in terms of passenger traffic. Last year, the Beijing Capital International Airport handled 73.9 million passengers, close to its planned capacity of 76 million passengers by 2015. The planned capacity for the second capital airport is at least 60 million passengers a year, according to earlier media reports. Yao was quoted as saying that the first stage of the second airport will be built to handle 40 million passengers a year.", "url": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2011-06/22/content_12753295.htm"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "China plans to build world's biggest airport near Beijing", "date": "2011-09-10", "content": "China is set to become the world's biggest aviation hub with its plans to construct a new mega-airport that would have as many as nine runways.

On this occasion, the media, who wrote about the new airport back in September 2011, focused once more on the enormous dimensions of the soon-to-be largest airport in the world. The current Beijing Capital Airport is already the second busiest airport in the world in terms of passenger numbers (73 million passengers last year). The opening of the new Terminal 3 less than four years ago (which alone is already larger than London's Heathrow airport) failed to decongest the airport, which had been planned to accommodate 75 million passengers annually. The new airport attempts to address the boom in Chinese air traffic in terms of surface as well as capacity, and the numbers are impressive: It is predicted that Beijing will be able to accommodate 370,000 passengers per day, in comparison to the 205,000 it currently services. The Daxing site (46km south of Beijing) consists of 54 square kilometers entirely dedicated to the airport. In addition, new high-speed lines connecting the future airport to the cities of Tianjin, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang and Shanghai are being considered; public transport (subways and shuttles) will allow passengers to reach the center of the capital in less than half an hour (Daxing is an hour away by car); and nine runways are currently planned (to date, Atlanta holds the record with six runways). The high volume of air traffic in Beijing is largely due to the great number of domestic flights: in 2010, Chinese travelers accounted for four times the number of foreign travelers. Further inflating these numbers, Beijing's airport also serves Tianjin and the cities of Hubei Province, which are conveniently connected to the airport by new high-speed lines. China's aviation industry is also rapidly developing and has tripled its profits between 2010 and 2011. The above article takes this opportunity to report on and speculate about the transformation of Beijing into a megapolis as the city expands and integrates neighboring villages. The airport hopes to be able to sustain and accommodate this urban growth. The report also notes the concerns of environmental groups regarding the increase of Chinese air traffic.

Zhong Ning, a spokeswoman for the Civil Aviation Administration of China, declined to comment on Sunday. According to CAAC News, a newspaper affiliated with the aviation administration, large-scale construction will commence next year, and the airport is scheduled to open before the end of 2018.

The new airport will be built close to Nanyuan Airport, which is mainly for military use, in the southern suburban district of Fengtai. Some flights handled at Nanyuan Airport will move to the new airport after it is completed, according to Zhu. Liu Weimin, the professor at the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China, said civil and military use must be coordinated for smooth operations. The military usually has airspace priority, Li said. \"The current law on civil aviation was made in 1995, and it should be revised after 18 years of tremendous changes in society and rapid economic development,\" he said.

The airport is being built in Daxing district, in between townships of Yufa, Lixian and Langfang in Hebei Province. It is reported that when built, the airport will be able to handle 72 million passengers and 620,000 flights per year. A new airport subway line will also be built connecting the airport to the city, with transfers to other existing subway lines as well. There are plans to construct highways and railways to accommodate the projects. The Civil Aviation Administration of China said the new airport railway will come online in 2019. The construction of highways and inter-city railways will make it possible for Beijing residents to travel to other major cities within two hours. The construction of the airport is in line with governmental policies to develop the Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province area as a whole. As the rest of Beijing becomes saturated, the government hopes to divert more population and industries towards the south of the city. Rising demand: The most immediate effects of the projects, however, lie with real estate. Even though airport construction only started a few months ago, housing prices in the area have soared. Local media reported that in 2013, houses in the area went for 5,000 yuan per square meter. But right now, an Internet search shows that housing prices have almost doubled. Housing agencies have started advertising online as well, many trying to persuade potential buyers with slogans such as \"Living next to the airport, enjoying high-end living styles,\" but also noting on the ads that the expected move-in date will be somewhere from 2015 to 2017. Mike Ma, a 26-year-old Beijing resident, recently bought a house in a newly developed apartment compound in Suncun, Daxing district. The compound is one of many that have sprung up since the government started pushing development in the district. He expects to move in by the end of 2015. The house owners in his compound are a mixture of locals and people from outside of Beijing. While he bought the house because he might be transferred to work at the new airport later on, he suspects many bought their houses as an investment. Personally, he feels Daxing isn't the most ideal place to live, because right now it still lags behind the rest of the city in education and healthcare resources, but he believes it was a good investment nonetheless. \"The government's policy is leaning towards developing the south part of Beijing, so in the future either renting or selling my apartment would be a good choice too,\" he said. The airport is predicted to bring economic benefits for Beijing, as part of a bigger scheme to unite the Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province areas. As construction started with the new airport, the Beijing Capital International Airport company and Beijing Jiaotong University co-published a report in which experts predict the construction and initial operation phases of the airport could create more than a million jobs. In the next 30 years, the airport will contribute more than 2.2 billion yuan to Beijing's GDP, the report said. Media reported that the new area, centered on the new airport, will at least hold 1.5 million people. It will be a factor in reducing the economic gap between south and north Beijing, observers said. The bigger picture: Luo Yameng, a Beijing-based urbanization expert, said site for the airport was chosen in south Beijing, close to Hebei Province, with the specific goal of diverting population there. \"From experience around the world, we know that building airports pushes economic development in the area,\" he said. \"So when the site is chosen close to Hebei and Tianjin, these governments will plan the arrangements of their industries and population accordingly.\" The most apparent changes will be in the service industry, with many hotels springing up. Then tourism and entertainment industries will follow, he said. The airport construction fits into the greater plan of developing south Beijing. Even though demolition of the houses around the airport site has yet to start, urbanization projects in the Daxing district as a whole have been developing for years and local residents have seen changes. Starting from 15 years ago, development projects started at Huangcun township, the center of urbanization in Daxing, and gradually radiated to other villages around. The demolition of Huangcun is now completed, with many new residential compounds built. Some of the surrounding villages were built to support projects from various industries. Residents from these areas, who once farmed for a living, have found jobs working for these projects. Wang Lin, a resident from Daxing district, said the changes started in Daxing a long time ago. Commercial residential compounds sprang up, with many middle or high-end developments by big developers such as Vanke. People like her started coming back home for jobs. Wang used to work and live in the city center, around the Chongwenmen area. Squeezing on the subway was the most difficult part of her day every day. But after she heard about the projects in her hometown, she moved back and found a job there, cutting huge amounts of time from her commute every day. The new development plan is also beneficial for Hebei Province, which relies on Beijing to power its development. The China Business News reported that the provincial government is planning an economic zone near the new airport that's five times the size of Beijing's city center. The city of Langfang, which borders Beijing directly to the south, is a good example. It plans to build a new district 115 square kilometers in size to the east of the new airport, with two additional sub-centers to the south of the airport that are planned to be 105 square kilometers in size. The new districts are slated to hold one million people in total. Drawbacks of development: The development isn't necessarily good news for everyone. Gong Jian, a resident who lives near the new airport, said he has seen a lot of construction near his home since 2008. He enjoys the newly built shopping centers and other living facilities, and says more people travel to Daxing for vacations as well since a new ski slope was built. However, living there has started to be tiring. He says the roads are more traffic-jammed than before. \"There was a report last year saying the district with the most population is Chaoyang district, but the district with most cars is Daxing,\" he said. Housing prices have risen crazily in just a couple of years, from a few thousand to almost 20,000 yuan per square meter. The Party secretary of Daxing district, Li Changyou, said construction of the new airport needs coordination from Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province, according to the Beijing Morning Post. He also said the government won't be pushing for real estate development around the new airport. It will only be to satisfy the workers in the area and local residents whose houses were demolished in the move. \"I don't recommend people inside the city come to the new airport area to buy houses, otherwise there'd be problems with traffic in the future as well,\" Li told the Beijing Morning Post. Luo, the urbanization expert, is skeptical of the new airport as well. \"Beijing is already full and is running over its capacity,\" he said. \"Building a new airport will only add to the pressure.\" He recommends moving Beijing's industries to more suitable cities, such as those with better environment, and establish a new political center outside of Beijing. But he notes that's just an idea that may never be realized, because in reality the government still plans according to need. Even though Luo notes the need for Beijing residents to have another airport, he thinks the government should take more into consideration when doing planning. \"There will always be the need for development, as Beijing is China's political center,\" he said. \"But the scale of urban development depends on geographical conditions and capability. It can't be decided by need only.\" But there is no stopping the development at this stage. Many are already rushing to buy houses before prices rise yet again, and many villagers, whose houses will be demolished to make way for the airport, believe that lives will get better. \"The demolition hasn't started, but we are ready,\" villagers told local media.", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/914615.shtml"}, {"title": "Beijing International Airport Terminal 1 to be world's biggest", "date": "2015-04-30", "content": "IT'S the world's fastest growing aviation sector so it's no wonder it needs the world's biggest airport.

China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines, together with SkyTeam partners that currently operate from BCIA, will move to Beijing Daxing International Airport, 31 miles south of the Chinese capital. According to CAAC official Lu Shen, CSN and CEA must move to the new Daxing airport to ease congestion at BCIA, which already accommodates more passengers annually than its intended 72 million capacity limit. Moving the two airlines will also release a substanial number of slots. In 2015 BCIA handled 93.1 million passengers, up 8.1 percent over the previous year. Lu said organizers had to hatch plans for CSN and CEA early to give the two carriers time to build their respective facilities. CSN, China's second biggest airline in terms of fleet size, will serve as the anchor tenant at BDIA. Officials said they will inform other carriers operating at BCIA, including China's fourth biggest, Hainan Airlines, whether or not they have to move at a later stage. As of now the authorities do not anticipate a delay in the opening of BDIA. Construction started late because it took seven years before the governments of Beijing, Tianjin and Heibei reached a consensus in July 2009 on the preferred site. Before choosing Daxing, planners had identified two other possible new airport sites-Wuqing in Tianjin and Langfang in Hebei province. Originally expected to start in 2010, construction finally got under way in 2014. Plans now call for completion of the $13.1 billion facility late in the third quarter of 2018, followed by testing and trial runs of the the systems. Under the government's master plan, BDIA will hold enough capacity to handle 45 million passengers by 2020, 72 million in 2025 and 120 million in the longer term. Plans include a provision for nine runways. Lu said the big Chinese carriers could face problems shifting operations, specifically involving the transportation of heavy ground equipment on Beijing's busy roads from BCIA to the new facility. Lu said that it could take three to four years for CSN and CEA to complete the move. \"This the airlines will have to iron out and plan their schedule carefully,\" Lu noted.

It's then that the world will have a new entry on the list of largest airports. If it opened today, it would rank second in the world for passenger capacity and, at 6,600 acres, rank eighth for overall size. These aren't the only superlatives in play: With a projected cost of $13 billion, Daxing will also rank as China's most expensive airport. That money will build seven runways, 78 gates, and include both a hip capsule hotel and a transportation hub, the latter connecting to both local and high-speed rail lines for easy transit to Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. At the center of the action will be the 7.5-million-square-foot passenger terminal, the world's largest, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects.

The current major airport for China's capital city is the aptly named Beijing Capital, which opened 20 miles northeast of the city center in 2008 for the Olympic Games, with capacity to see 80 million passengers a year. Less than a decade old, it's already ranked as the world's second busiest airport and is stretched well over capacity, with 94.4 million passengers in 2016. At 104 million passengers last year, Atlanta's Hartsfield- Jackson International Airport is holding down the number one spot, but together, Capital and Daxing airports are capable of welcoming more than 170 million travelers through Beijing each year, with Daxing carrying the brunt of the load with a 100 million annual capacity.

The financing of the multi-billion dollar project which includes an 80 billion RMB terminal is by the Chinese government, the Commission for the Development of China Fund, the Bureau of Civil Aviation and through private sector development. The Daxing Airport, which is expected to take some of the aviation and passenger load off the Beijing Capital International Airport, will be the largest comprehensive transportation hub in China according to its long- term plan, with an annual passenger flow throughput exceeding 100 million. Shaped liked flower petals and incorporating Chinese architecture elements, the new airport's main terminal, which is designed to withstand earthquakes, has five short concourses and a longer one, which will house 79 boarding gates, jutting out into the airside area and forming a stable and symmetry structure. This is to allow more parking of aircraft simultaneously, shortening of the longest walking distance from the centre of the terminal to the farthest boarding bridge to 600 meters and walking time to less than eight minutes, thus bringing on an efficiency higher than any other similar scale airport in the world. The project was begun in December 2014 and is located between Yufa Town and Lixian Tang of Beijing Daxing District and Guangyang District of Langfang in the Hebei Province 46km from the Tian'anmen Square, 67km from the BCIA and 85km from the Tianjin Airport, all close to the Chinese capital. Briefing three full bus loads of local and international journalists who visited the site of the construction on Monday, October 16, 2017, the spokesperson for the contractors, Mr Zhu Wenxin, said the work was being carried out on schedule and it was certain the deadline for completion would be met. Extent of work: He said by the end of September 2017, over 90 per cent of the earthwork on the airfield as well as dynamic compaction and impact rolling had been completed, while concreting work of the six runways and taxiways as well as pipelines and housing projects had comprehensively progressed. Integrated transportation: To cater for the massive volumes of passengers, the airport would have five vertical and two horizontal integrated transportation networks comprising a highway with four expressways from the city centre, 200 metres wide inter-city railway and city railway systems and a high-speed railway with a design speed of 250 km/hour running under the terminal. A railway station would be set up on the second underground floor of the terminal from where passengers can directly enter the airport through massive volume elevators or automatic escalators. Airport terminal: The terminal covering a total area of 700,000m2 has two levels of departure floors to handle a 72 million passenger throughput while part of the aircraft stands will be used with a mixture of international and domestic flights and a centralised transfer procedure area set up to facilitate easy transfer of passengers. The waiting area will consist of both indoor and outdoor spaces with five outdoor gardens which will be named \"Silk Garden\", \"Tea Garden\", \"Porcelain Garden\", \"Field Garden\" and \"China Garden at the front end of the piers to embody the connotation of the Silk Road. Describing the terminal as the largest shock-absorbing building in China, the spokesman said, \"To ensure safety from earthquakes, rubber isolation bearings have been installed to build a combined anti-earthquake system and effectively enhance the anti-earthquake performance, safety and reliability of the terminal building.\" Runway structure: There will also be six runways for the new omni-directional airport structure, with four going vertical and two going horizontal, which will be the first in China. According to Mr Zhu, the design, which offers multiple feasible solutions for air traffic control \"can thus utilise the limited space above Beijing to the utmost, reduce the taxing time of aircraft and noise and improve the efficiency of integrated air-ground operation.\" The project is also described as an example of a green airport and a smart effort that is realising ecological construction with its implementation of 54 green construction indexes in resource saving, environmental friendliness, high operation efficiency and humanistic service. It is expected to ferry a cargo and mail throughput of four million tonnes annually when fully operational but by a near-term target year of 2025 have a 72 million passenger throughput, two million cargos and mail throughput and 620,000 aircraft movements using four runways. BCIA currently has 880,000 aircraft movements annually and a passenger throughput of 90 million. Kotoka expansion: Ghana, for now, may not have even a fraction of China's US$ 60 billion for another international airport, especially when it does not seem that the Kotoka International Airport is bursting at its seems except for the weekends when there is a lot of traffic. With the ongoing expansion work at the KIA involving the construction of a third terminal which started on March 26, 2017, however, it will not be long when there will no longer be space for further expansion. We must be thinking of building a second and larger international airport after the US$400 million works on Kotoka which has served the country very well. According to the Ghana Airports Company Limited the new terminal, which is designed for international traffic and expected to be completed in May this year, will ease the pressure on the existing two terminals and handle up to five million passengers a year, with an expansion potential of up to 6.5 million passengers. The terminal can also be accessed from a new main road to be constructed as part of the project, while the main entrance will be located in front of the central check-in hall to make it easy to enter the terminal. Terminal three, which is a design and build concept being undertaken by Turkish construction company, Mapa Construction MNG Holding, will comprise five levels spread across an area of 45,000m\u00b2 and will feature six contact stands for Code E aircraft wing span) and two additional remote stands. The new terminal will have the capacity to process 1,250 passengers at peak hour, a large retail and commercial area, three business lounges, six fixed links and seven air bridges expandable to eight, and parking space with the capacity to handle more than 700 cars. According to the GACL, the check-in hall is being designed with architecture that incorporates expressive forms reflecting Ghanaian culture and values. The departure level of the terminal will feature 56 check-in desks and 30 passport control counters, of which four will be e-gate positions, and eight security lanes. The arrival level will house 24 immigration counters, four e-gate positions expandable to eight, and four reclaim devices. A fully automated baggage handling system designed in accordance with the latest European Civil Aviation Conference Hold Baggage Screening requirements will also be provided to handle 3,500 bags an hour.

Scheduled for opening next year on a fast-tracked construction schedule, Daxing is huge, with seven runways, 78 gates, and a main terminal (pictured) designed by Zaha Hadid Architects and ADPI. Estimated to cost $13bn, the airport located 29 miles from Beijing is claimed to have the largest main terminal in the world, and will eventually have a throughput of 100 million passengers a year. It is expected to be the first Zaha Hadid-designed airport to be completed. Its operator, China Resources Land, picked Lead 8 based on the firm's experience designing \"hybrid workspaces\" and a track-record in aviation designs, said Lead 8, which was founded in 2014 and now has 200 designers based in offices in Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, London and Singapore. The commercial terminal must have \"new generation\" workspaces, with integrated retail, dining and entertainment offerings. \"Under the challenging site conditions, Lead 8 adopted a creative and inspiring approach in handling of the spaces, while working in collaboration with the operators,\" its press release said. \"The new aeropolis is a glimpse into the shape of the cities of the future,\" said Simon Chua, Lead 8 cofounder and executive director. \"Our future workspaces are being influenced by the changing lifestyles of a new generation, as work, entertainment and hospitality blurs the boundaries to create new opportunities.\"", "url": "https://www.globalconstructionreview.com/architects-lead-8-win-role-beijings-massive-new-da/"}, {"title": "World's longest-span aircraft hangar gets its roof", "date": "2018-09-05", "content": "As the last roof structure was lifted in place Monday morning, the aircraft hangar in Beijing Daxing International Airport, an international hub, was capped after around four months of operation. The hangar has a longer span than any structure of its kind. Weighing 7,200 tons, the 404.5-meter-long and 97.5-meter-wide roof truss was mostly pre-assembled on the ground and then elevated to a height of 38.5 meters after three rounds of roof raisings. The first two took place on Aug 18 and Aug 31. Sitting beside the runway, the hangar cannot be built too high due to safety concerns during take-off and landing. Therefore, the W-truss was adopted for building the hangar's roof, helping to lower the roof height. The structure also brought the benefit of saving steel consumption. \"At least 100 million tons of steel would be used if the roof were not built with a W-truss structure. But we only used 7,200 tons of steel, maybe the lowest amount in building equal-sized hangars,\" said Hong Biao, a project manager from Beijing Construction Engineering Group involved in the construction. Weighing 600 tons in total, tubes for draining water and fire protection and electric wires have been uplifted alongside the roof, sparing the trouble of aerial work and shortening the construction period. Covering an area of 390,000 square meters, or about the size of five football fields, the long-span hangar can hold a maximum of 12 aircraft, including two A380 jumbos, three Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft and seven narrow-bodies. \"From design, material purchase to construction, every process features Chinese wisdom and Chinese techniques. It is one hundred percent built by China,\" said Zhao Boyou, engineer at China Aviation Planning and Design Institute, part of the State-owned industry giant Aviation Industry Corporation of China, Ltd.

Ninety-three percent of the flight zone earthwork has been completed and the municipal transportation, such as the overpass entering and leaving the terminals, is near completion, he added. According to an earlier plan, by 2025 the airport will have four runways and 268 parking bays that will accommodate 620,000 flights and handle 72 million passengers per year. Previously, the naming of the new airport had involved disputes because it is located between Beijing and Hebei province. Beijing wanted to name it with Daxing, a district in Beijing, while Hebei preferred to have Langfang city in its name. Later more parties joined in the fight, including a national political adviser who suggested naming it Jing Jin Ji International Airport (which stands for Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei), and a city development institute in Beijing suggesting the name of Beijing Xiongan International Airport.

Located on the border of Beijing and Langfang, Hebei province, the new airport, which will be Beijing's second international airport and is positioned to be a large international hub, is now undergoing interior decoration, according to Zhang Xiaofeng, deputy manager of the terminal construction department. He said the decoration will be completed by the end of this year and the airport is planned to open in 2019. The project, which costs 80 billion ($11.5 billion), is 46 kilometers from Tian'anmen Square, 26 km from downtown Langfang in Hebei, 55 km from Xiongan New Area, and 67 km from the existing Beijing Capital International Airport, and is expected to serve as the airport hub for North China. With four runways and a 700,000 square meter terminal area, the airport is expected to be the world's largest airport upon completion.

Emma Kelly takes a look at the giant new hub. The Civil Aviation Administration of China is readying for the opening of the latest jewel in its commercial aviation crown, Beijing Daxing International Airport, in September 2019. The project has been huge in terms of design and construction, as well as ambition, with the new Beijing hub expecting to claim the title of the world's busiest airport from the US Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport within a few years of its opening. It has also come at a high cost - from 64 billion yuan up to the project price cap which was set at 80 billion yuan. The new airport is located in the Daxing district of Beijing, south of the city and some 67km from the existing Beijing Capital International Airport, which is currently the world's second-largest in terms of passenger traffic, handling over 95 million passengers in 2017 - well above its original passenger handling capacity of 75 million. Beijing Capital is creaking at its seams and has become renowned for its delays - although delays in China are still inevitable unless the military further releases its hold on airspace. Beijing Daxing will not replace Beijing Capital, but will instead complement it, providing initially a much needed 45 million passenger-handling capacity per annum on opening and rising to 72 million by 2025 and eventually over 100 million, with its initial four runways. The ambitious project was first approved by the government of China in January 2013, with construction of the airport on a 6,620 acre site starting in December 2014. Early delays in land acquisition and demolition work meant the project was slow to start, but a rapid construction period of just five years means that completion is now expected by 30 June 2019, with operations commencing on 30 September, according to the CAAC. At a recent \"mobilisation rally\" designed to drive those involved towards the final goal, CAAC administrator Feng Zhenglin called on the workforce to focus on diligence, win a \"decisive battle\" and \"focus on key activities, coordination and cooperation, as well as truth-seeking and pragmatism, in an effort to secure a decisive victory in ensuring a high level of safety, project schedule and smooth operational preparation, and strive to achieve the operation of the new airport on schedule\". In order to ensure the facility is ready in time, the CAAC has worked with Tongji University on a comprehensive management and control plan which covers the construction plan for the remaining elements; a plan for the acceptance inspection and facilities handover; details for the operational preparation and acceptance inspection; as well as clarifying the roadmap, timetable, workbook and responsibility list for the remaining construction and operational work. Major milestones in the project have already been achieved. By late October, the CAAC said that 93 percent of the earthwork and 62 percent of the road surface construction was completed, the terminal building has entered the final stage of fitting, electromechanical installation is under way, as well as jet bridge construction and all interior fit out is expected to be completed by April. The west air traffic control tower has also entered the final stage of interior completion and is expected to be finished in June while an east tower is also under construction, and the aviation oil storage tank has been completed. At 46km from Beijing's Tiananmen Square, transportation links to the new airport have been an important consideration in the project and the construction of transportation links has been accelerated to create a major transportation hub. A new airport north line expressway was due to be opened in December and a new airport expressway will be ready in June. By opening day, the Beijing-Xiongan inter-city high-speed railway, a new subway line linking downtown Beijing and the airport and the new expressways will all be operational, says the CAAC. Meanwhile, airspace planning for the Beijing terminal area, capacity evaluation, flight procedure design and operational plans are all ahead of schedule, CAAC reports. The focus has shifted from project construction to operational preparation to ensure the new airport can enter operation as scheduled, it adds. The project has been very much international in its design and execution. Netherlands Airport Consultants won the contract to design the airport's master plan in 2011. NACO says it paid particular attention to the landside accessibility and incorporated into the design various modes of public transport, including high-speed trains, the metro, local buses and inter-airport trains in a Ground Transportation Centre, which will be located at the front of the terminals and will include a smart parking concept. The aim was to spread traffic flow as much as possible in order to avoid congestion and guarantee accessibility. The layout of the eight runways, taxiways and aprons throughout the airport were designed to keep taxi distances as short as possible, despite the vast size of the airport. In October 2014, the Beijing New Airport Headquarters created a joint design team comprising French company ADP Ingenierie and UK-based Zaha Hadid Architects, along with design and engineering consultancies Buro Happold, Mott MacDonald and EC Harris. The concept design was completed in February 2015 and the result is spectacular. The design is focused on user experience, with ADPI designing one centralised compact star shape single passenger handling terminal and with vertically stacked international and domestic processes. Although the terminal measures 700,000m2 - the world's largest - its compact design means that distances between check-in and the gate are minimised, including between gates for transferring passengers, according to Zaha Hadid Architects. Each aircraft pier radiates directly from the terminal's central court where all passenger services and amenities are located, meaning that no automated people mover is required, allowing passengers to simply walk the short distance to everywhere they need to go, it adds. Buro Happold says the maximum that passengers will need to walk to their gate is 600m thanks to the design. The design is based on traditional Chinese architecture whereby interconnected spaces are organised around a central courtyard, with passengers guided by the design through the departure, arrival or transfer zones towards the central grand courtyard, which Zaha Hadid describes as a \"multi-layered meeting space at the very heart of the terminal\". Flowing parabolic folds within the terminal's vaulted roof reach to the ground to support the structure and bring natural light into the building. The design of the terminal is also based on sound environmental principles, with the architect noting that by housing many aircraft gates within one terminal with a single passenger handling centre, rather than having many smaller terminals and inter-terminal shuttle trains, the carbon footprint is significantly reduced. Buro Happold says environmental drivers played a key role in the design, with numerous passive elements incorporated, including shading strategies, high performance glazing and carefully placed roof lights that optimise the energy performance. These solutions alone will result in an estimated 50 per cent reduction in overall energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions compared with similar buildings with more traditional design. The design is also highly flexible, allowing the terminal to adapt to operate in different configurations depending on the aircraft and passenger traffic mix during the day. Fellow design team member Buro Happold says the terminal is \"user focused, energy efficient and built with the flexibility to sustain future growth\". It adds: \"It was essential to deliver a design that allowed passengers to move easily and intuitively around the vast new terminal. Adaptability and sustainability were also key drivers, as the airport will accommodate 45 million passengers per year on opening, rising to 75 million over the next few years. Our client also wanted to ensure the terminal was a welcoming and inspiring place for passengers, characterised by open and expansive interiors.\" The result is a terminal that is \"highly functional and aesthetically beautiful\", Buro Happold said. In August, international design studio Lead 8 was awarded the contract to design the commercial terminal. Its interior design is based on maximising natural daylight and indoor greenery, with a hybrid workspace designed to create a \"pleasant, vibrant and intimate environment for travellers and co- workers\", it says. The terminal features a new generation of workspaces integrated with retail, dining and entertainment offerings. \"The new aeropolis is a glimpse into the shape of the cities of the future. Our future workspaces are being influenced by the changing lifestyles of a new generation, as work, entertainment and hospitality blurs the boundaries to create new opportunities,\" says Simon Chua, founder and executive director at Lead 8. He adds: \"We hope this scheme will inspire future airport developments, as there is a growing demand for quality workspaces with integrated natural environments, particularly in Beijing.\" ", "url": "https://asianaviation.com/airport-development-world-readithe-interior-of-the-new-airport-in-beijing-is-designed-to-cut-down-on-the-walking-distance-for-passengers-es-for-beijing-daxing/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Roof Completes on the World's Largest Airport", "date": "2019-01-03", "content": "THE roof of Beijing Daxing International Airport - the world's largest air terminal, currently under construction in China - was completed just a few days before the end of 2018.

That's modest compared to what Beijing is opening next. Crews are putting the final touches on what will be one of the world's largest and busiest airports. Designed by the late British architect Zaha Hadid, the phoenix-shaped Beijing Daxing International Airport is due to open in September as the latest major Chinese project even as the country's economy cools. Officials say the $12 billion Daxing airport could one day serve more than 100 million passengers per year, approaching the traffic volumes of the busiest airport in the world, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. Rising out of farmland about 30 miles south of central Beijing, the new transport hub is a testament to the growth in civil aviation in China - which is expected to overtake the United States as the largest market in the early- or mid-2020s - and the government's vision to develop its industrial north through infrastructure investment. The airport construction started in 2014 before China's economy began to slow. But it fits into the priorities of President Xi Jinping, whose government continues to spend heavily on infrastructure and transportation as key drivers of development. The country invested $120 billion and $12 billion in railways and civil aviation, respectively, in 2018, according to transportation authorities. The capital's main airport now, Beijing Capital International Airport northeast of the city, has been straining at maximum capacity for years and plagued by delays, said Yi Wei, deputy manager of the Daxing airport's planning department. \"It's heavily overloaded,\" Yi said. \"We estimate, basically, that about 400 flights every day are held up because of air traffic control approval.\" The number of Chinese fliers has been rising faster than airports can keep up. Annual passenger traffic reached 1.264 billion in 2018, up 10.2 percent from the previous year, says the Civil Aviation Administration of China. China will overtake the United States as the world's largest aviation market by 2022, two years sooner than previously predicted, according to the International Air Transport Association. Industry analysts say that while a new airport is badly needed, it still may not solve the long-standing problem of delays. China has some of the strictest controls on flying during bad weather, often leading to mass groundings during thunderstorms. It also has one of the tightest controls on civilian airspace. Only a quarter of the country's airspace is open to civilian jets, while the rest is reserved for the military. That ratio is reversed in the United States. The new airport in Beijing's far south is also part of a major project by the Chinese government to develop the plain that includes the cities of Beijing and Tianjin as well as the smog-blanketed Hebei province, which has mostly relied on agriculture and industries like steel for economic growth. Daxing airport will be at the center of the new economic zone and will be accessible by rail to Xiong'an, a Hebei province farming town where China will relocate many \"noncore\" central government offices, essentially creating a secondary Chinese capital from scratch. Cao Yunchun, a professor from the Institute of Airport Economics, Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, said the new airport will stimulate the development of the relatively poor south of Beijing and nearby Hebei province. \"In the future, the area will be a hub for the flow of people, the flow of travels, the flow of physical goods, the flow of capital, and the flow of technology,\" he said. The new airport has also promised to serve passengers from 28 cities, who would be able to reach the airport within three hours through high-speed rail. It has four runways and a 3.37 million square foot terminal building and plans to accommodate 72 million passengers and 2 million tons of cargo annually by 2025, with a long-term annual target of handling over 100 million passengers, 4 million tons of goods, and operating six runways. Daxing's long-term expected passenger flow would put it among the world's busiest airports. By comparison, Atlanta's airport handled 107 million passengers in 2018 - the most in the world - followed by Beijing's existing Capital airport at 101 million and Dubai International Airport at 89 million, according to Airports Council International. Daxing airport officials say the project has boosted the domestic industry and economy. \"The general contracting is done by ourselves. We didn't corporate with international companies,\" said project manager Li Jianhua. \"Most of the equipment is domestically made. Most of the materials are domestically made.\" Nicknamed \"the Starfish\" by Chinese media, the new airport will have five concourses spiraling out of the primary hall. Five traditional Chinese gardens will be built at the edge of each line where passengers can wait for their flights. According to Li, as the Chinese idiom goes, prosperity is brought by the dragon and the phoenix. The new airport is phoenix-shaped, in contrast with the existing dragon-inspired Beijing Capital International Airport.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/beijing-airport-inside-starfish-worlds-largest-and-busiest-airport-built-by-china-2022801"}, {"title": "First commercial aircraft land at Beijing Daxing International Airport", "date": "2019-05-14", "content": "Planes from four Chinese airlines landed safely at the newly-built Beijing Daxing International Airport during a formal flight test trial on Monday. The airport is nearing the end of construction and will become the second in China's capital city. An Airbus A380 from China Southern Airlines became the first to land, followed by an A350-900 from China Eastern Airlines, a Boeing B747-8 from Air China and a B787-9 from Xiamen Airlines. The test flights verified various systems in the airport, including flight procedures, minimum performance criteria, communication facilities navigation, meteorology, runways and the airfield lighting system. This is the first time that commercial passenger aircraft have landed at the airport, signaling that the basic construction is complete. After this verification, the airport will go on with its efforts to get ready for commercial operation. In addition to commercial flights, the airport has previously been tested with other types of planes for 112 hours. Two more tests will be conducted before the airport is put into use. One is a specialized test for low visibility situations, the other is a full-scale test set for August 9. China Eastern and China Southern Airlines will transfer most of its Beijing routes to the new airport in the coming years. The bases for the two companies are nearly complete. Xiamen Air will move all of its flights to Daxing Airport next March. Xiamen has also confirmed that its subsidiary, Hebei Air, will join the first-day operations of the new airport. \"After the transfer to Daxing International Airport, Xiamen Air will invest more than 50 aircraft by 2025. We will better serve the collaborative development strategy of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Area and the construction of the Xiong'an New Area, by building a fully-covered air network, which includes flights from Daxing to major domestic cities, Southeast and Northeast Asia, as well as Europe, Australia and America,\" Says Chen Li, assistant to general manager of Xiamen Air. The ICAO code of Beijing Daxing International Airport is approved by the IATA and CAAC to be \"PKX\" and \"ZBAD.\" The new airport sits at the junction of Beijing's southern Daxing District and Langfang, a city in northern Hebei Province. It is expected to handle 45 million passengers annually by 2021 and 72 million by 2025. So far over 50 airlines have expressed their interest in operating from the airport. The airport is of the highest standard in China and has the longest runways to provide the best condition for planes to land. The budget for building the airport amounted to 11.5 billion U.S. dollars. The whole construction process is set to end by June 30. And it is planned to put the airport into commercial use three months later.

So far, more than 50 Chinese and overseas airlines have expressed their interest to operate at the new airport. Beijing Daxing International Airport is located in the capital's southern Daxing District, approximately 46 kilometres from Tiananmen Square, the centre of the capital. The new airport will enable seamless connections with the capital's metro system via the New Airport Line, and intercity railways that offer connectivity to nearby cities, including Hebei's Langfang city and Xiong'an New District, a state-level new urban district given special economic and development support by the government. The construction of Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to be completed by June 30, before beginning operations on September 30 this year. The new airport is equipped with four runways, expecting an annual passenger capacity of 45 million by 2021, and 72 million by 2025.

To show construction of the mega project is on schedule, planes from four Chinese airlines touched ground safely at the airport's freshly laid concrete runways during test trials in May. Once completed, Daxing will alleviate pressure on the city's other airport, Beijing Capital International, which had a new $4bn terminal constructed in time for the 2008 Olympics. Last year, the airport, which serves nearly 100 million passengers a year, was ranked the second busiest in the world behind Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. However, it's thought that one day Daxing, which has been designed with expansion in mind, could overtake them both. Increasing demand for aviation: China is the most populous country in the world, and as its middle classes grow, so does the public's demand for aviation, both international and domestic. As reported in The Washington Post, China's Civil Aviation Administration say annual passenger traffic reached 1.26 billion in 2018, up 10.2% from the previous year. In fact, the International Air Transport Association now predicts China will overtake the US as the world's largest aviation market by 2022 - two years sooner than previously forecasted. \"Daxing is expected to handle around 45 million passengers annually.\" Despite this increase in demand, passengers from in and around Beijing have had to rely solely on the Capital International Airport, which lies northeast of the city. As such, the facility has been struggling at maximum capacity for several years, with some estimates suggesting around 400 flights a day are delayed. Daxing will provide much needed new capacity for the city; it is expected to handle around 45 million passengers annually after opening and around 70 million by 2025. This will rank it among the world's busiest; Hartsfield- Jackson Atlanta's airport in the US handled 107 million passengers in 2018 and Dubai International Airport 89 million, according to Airports Council International. Unique airport design: Passengers will be able to easily access Daxing by high speed train within three hours from around 28 cities. Once they arrive, flyers will find a 700,000m2 terminal and 80,000m2 ground transportation centre connected to five concourses which snake out from the primary hall. There will be five traditional gardens for passengers to wait for their flights. \"The facility occupies a staggering 18 square miles of land.\" The structure was designed by ADP Ing\u00e9nierie alongside the late, great British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid, who also masterminded China's Guangzhou Opera House. Unusually for an airport, its formation comprises of one passenger handling centre rather than several terminals. According to the designers, this borrows from traditional Chinese architecture that organises interconnected spaces around a central courtyard and will minimise the buildings environmental footprint. Operators will initially open four, then up to eight, new runways as passenger numbers grow. The facility occupies a staggering 18 square miles of land and it has been reported that around 20,000 people were evicted to enable construction of the project. A process that in most other countries would likely have taken decades to pass, but happened much quicker in China because all land is owned by the state. The government reportedly want to turn the southern suburbs into a new super city that will create economic growth and prosperity, as well as major regeneration in Beijing's far south, including the Tianjin and Hebei provinces. The region has traditionally relied on farming, but will now have direct access to the airport by rail from Xiong'an, as well as several governmental offices newly relocated to the region. Flight allocation: While there is little argument that Beijing needs more airport capacity, especially in light of the governments' city expansion plans, some have argued the city would be better served if more airspace was opened up by the military for commercial airplanes. Professor Li Xiaojin from the Civil Aviation University of China told China Daily that by the university's calculations: \"If the airforce transfers just 10% of the airspace under its control to civil airlines, an extra CNY200bn will be generated in GDP.\" Roughly 70% of the country's airspace is controlled by the military - in the US it is only 20% - meaning there is only marginal space for commercial aircraft, restricting options for departure and arrival routing in bad weather and reducing the number of take-offs and landings that airports can handle. \"The new runways will give airlines more access to the limited flight corridors available.\" The lack of available airspace is largely blamed for the frequent delays suffered by flyers. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China, last year flight delays increased 50%, with only 71% of flights taking off on time. There are no official plans to provide more commercial airspace but the new runways will give airlines more access to the limited flight corridors available, facilitating more take-offs and landings. However, there has been competition over who will have access to the new capacity. As reported by the South China Morning Post, China's big three state-owned airlines - Air China, China Eastern and China Southern Airlines - are all grappling for the rights to fly into and out of the new mega airport. Between them the three airlines hold two-thirds of China's civil aviation market. The news site reports that a newly published government plan in April stated that China Eastern will retain its Beijing to Shanghai route at Beijing Capital International airport but will sacrifice 10% of its air traffic at Daxing, giving Air China a foothold at the new airport. As the state-airlines continue to battle it out, international carriers have kept quiet about their plans. It's thought international carriers are cautious about Daxing because it is located away from Beijing's business district and much of the expatriate community, who tend to live in the city's north-east. However, it's expected they will follow the lead of their Chinese partners with whom they share flight codes, booking systems and frequent flier information. Future impact: The recent landing of commercial planes at Daxing signals that construction is nearing completion on time and as planned, which is no mean feat for a project of this size. \"Daxing cements the Chinese government's ambitions for aviation.\" As tests continue at the airport - China has some of the strictest aviation regulations in the world - it's hoped the new facility will have an overall positive impact on the local aviation industry, providing much needed extra capacity. It's clear that Daxing cements the Chinese government's ambitions for aviation in the country. And while adding 100 million of extra capacity might seem heavy-handed, it's worth noting that research by chief economist Li Xunlei, for financial institution Zhongtai Securities, suggests around one billion Chinese people have never before boarded a plane. If this was to change, the country could find itself requiring several more Daxings in the future to meet demand.", "url": "https://www.airport-technology.com/analysis/beijing-daxing-international-airport-construction/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Beijing Daxing International Airport: soon into service", "date": "2019-07-11", "content": "Five years after the launch of the project, the new Beijing Daxing International Airport will start operating next season. The Beijing Daxing International Airport project is entering its final phase. Its entry into service is scheduled for Fall. It took five years to build one of the largest airports in the world, covering an area of 700,000 square meters with 5 kilometers of frontage. BDIA Terminal 1, located in Daxing 60 km south of Tiananmen Square, is the result of a collaboration between ADP Ing\u00e9nierie - member company of Group ADP and winner of the Beijing New Airport Construction Headquarters international competition in 2014 - and Zaha Hadid Architects and the Beijing Institute for Architectural Design. The terminal will have an annual capacity of 45 million passengers at the opening, which can be increased to 72 million passengers per year. As for the airport itself, it is expected that in the long run it will have seven runways and a capacity of more than 100 million passengers per year. The star-shaped airport has a unique boarding pier control center. Its terminal was built so as to be compact with a superposition of international and domestic levels vertically, privileged to a horizontal expansion. A multimodal land transport system is offered, knowing that the distance between the heart of the terminal and the farthest gate is at most 600 meters. \"ADP Ing\u00e9nierie has been working in China for more than 25 years in China and the Daxing Airport' Terminal 1 is one of our major achievements in terms of architectural design\", said Gratien Maire, CEO of ADP Ing\u00e9nierie. \"Thanks to the strength of the infrastructures design in the largest cities of the country, we contribute to the development of the airport industry in China.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China is expected to issue an operating license soon, signaling that the facility will be qualified to handle flights. Licensing is based on a six-month evaluation. Starting at 9 am, nearly 9,000 volunteers carried 5,600 pieces of luggage through the security and boarding processes on the third and fourth floors of the airport's departure hall. Other passengers dropped off their checked baggage at Caoqiao subway station for transfer to flights for the first time. Four check-in counters opened at the station at around 8:30 am, including one to test international flights and three for domestic ones. Automated trains, running from Caoqiao station in downtown Beijing to the new airport, were also put into operation. The trains, each with seven passenger cars and one for luggage, are scheduled to run every 8.5 minutes. Li Jianhua, project manager of the Beijing Daxing Airport terminal construction office, said the test operations are significant for the airport, especially for passenger safety. \"It helps the airport assess its operational readiness and fix possible problems,\" he said. Since transferring terminal operations to the property owner in mid-July, Li said he was greatly relieved to see the facility's construction move forward. \"I spent four years building the airport and I am lucky to be a part of the whole process and watch the world's largest seamless steel structure airport terminal building come together,\" he said. The tests also included scenarios involving security system failures and the operations of several restaurants, cafes and retail venues, a news release from the airport said. Blue Frog Bar and Grill, a Western chain in China, opened its first airport dining area in the new facility. Restaurant manager Xie Ruian said the menu was simplified down to six choices to cater to the urgent needs of airport passengers. \"Preparation times will be shortened to 15 minutes for each dish,\" he said, adding that the restaurant also offers several drinks tailored to foreign travelers' tastes. China Eastern Airlines, which will become a major airline service operator at the airport, put 5G technology to work on Friday during the test run.

Beijing Daxing International Airport (PKX) will see its first commercial flight take off around September 20, according to Chinese state media, with main tenant China Southern planning to deploy an Airbus A380, the world's biggest airliner, for the maiden journey. The greatly anticipated airport ushers in a new era for air travel to and from the Chinese capital, which has been in desperate need of a second global gateway. The existing Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) is hitting full capacity, making it nearly impossible for airlines to add flights at desirable times. In 2018, more than 100 million travelers passed through its three terminals - making it only the second airport in the world to cross that passenger traffic milestone, after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta. China is projected to overtake the United States as the world's biggest air travel market by 2022. The multibillion-dollar Daxing, designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid and her Chinese partners, is built for the future, boasting four runways and a terminal the size of 97 soccer pitches upon opening of the first phase - as well as customer-service robots that will provide travelers with flight updates and airport information. The \"modest\" initial operational target is to accommodate 72 million passengers and 2 million tons of cargo annually by 2025. The ambitious master plan calls for the building of a total of seven runways, and moving at least 100 million passengers and 4 million tons of cargo a year through the airport. Construction for the $11.5 billion project began in 2014, with more than 40,000 workers on site at its peak. The terminal bears all the hallmarks of Hadid's signature contour lines, with plenty of natural light shining through its more than 8,000 distinct rooftop windows. Nicknamed \"starfish\" by Chinese media for its shape of five concourses connected to a main hall, Daxing aims to reduce walking for passengers, long a complaint about many new mega-hubs. The airport authority has promised a distance of no more than 600 meters (650 yards) - about eight minutes of walking - between security checkpoints and the remotest gates. Another passenger concern is Daxing's location. It's in the far south of Beijing, a city notorious for traffic jams. The new airport is some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Tiananmen Square in the city center - and even farther away from the main business districts in the east and north. Brushing aside such worries, officials say they have built more than just an airport - but rather a truly integrated transportation hub that will eventually see high-speed rail, inter-city services and downtown-to-airport express trains all stopping right beneath the terminal. The airport express trains, traveling at a top speed of 160 kilometers an hour (100 mph), promise to whisk arriving passengers to the city in less than 20 minutes. Yet others say a new mammoth aviation hub will only worsen flight delays in Beijing, already ranked near the bottom of on-time performance lists among airports worldwide. There is no indication that the Chinese military, which controls most of the country's airspace, will loosen its grip to give airliners more maneuver room. But aviation officials and airline executives predict reduced delays at Daxing thanks to its multi-directional runway design that improves operational efficiency in the air, as well as its location south of Beijing - eliminating many flight detours aimed at avoiding the city's large \"no-fly\" zone. Alliance shakeups, time slot shifts: For frequent fliers around the world, though, it may take some time to figure out if Daxing will be their preferred gateway to the Chinese capital. It was going to be a crown jewel for Skyteam, one of the three global airline alliances, with China-based members China Southern and China Eastern - each assigned 40% of the new airport's departure and arrival time slots by the government - moving all their Beijing flights to Daxing to become anchor carriers. Other Skyteam members such as Delta, Korean and Air France-KLM will move to the new airport in phases. China Southern, however, will now leave Skyteam by the end of this year, having signed agreements with several members of rival Oneworld alliance, including American Airlines and British Airways, for closer cooperation. Adding another twist to the confusing plot, Air China - the country's flag carrier and a Star Alliance member - was supposed to remain at the current Capital Airport along with other Star carriers. But it was recently given 10% of Daxing's time slots after authorities allowed China Eastern to keep its highly profitable Beijing-Shanghai shuttle flights at Capital. All the tenant intrigue aside, Chinese officials are eager to showcase the country's newest mega-hub to the world upon its grand opening, announcing that flights from Daxing will cover 112 destinations around the globe by next spring.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/beijing-daxing-international-airport-opens/index.html"}, {"title": "China opens huge Beijing Daxing International Airport", "date": "2019-09-25", "content": "China has formally opened new multi-billion dollar Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is nearly the size of 100 football fields.

It is expected to provide much-needed airport capacity for the city, alleviating pressure from the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport. Many foreign and domestic airlines such as British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines have decided to move part of their operations to the new airport. Beijing Daxing International Airport has incurred an approximate expenditure of CNY120bn, while the projects in its periphery received investments of CNY330bn.

And that's certainly the case with one of her final projects before her untimely death in 2016, Beijing's Daxing International Airport. Critics and fans alike wait years, often upwards of a decade, to finally see the actualized version of her imitable vision, witnessing the delicate weaves of her lines go from a proposal to a physical structure. Which was exactly what happened yesterday, in China's capital city, after five years of construction, when the Pritzker Prize-winning architect's Beijing Daxing International Airport was completed. There was much hype leading up to the completion of this airport (in fact, it was named one of AD's 14 most anticipated buildings of 2019). The opening ceremony was attended by the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, who surely was using the event as a political boost, as the country prepares to celebrate its own version of Independence Day on October 1, marking 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Patriotism aside, much of the excitement came from the fact that the new airport, Beijing's second, is now the largest single-structured airport in the world. Spanning more than 7.5 million square feet, along with four runways, PKX (as is the new airport code) is expected to handle 72 million passengers a year by 2025. By 2040, four additional runways will be added to accommodate 100 million passengers a year. For almost every other airport in the world, these types of staggering numbers would cause passengers difficulty moving throughout congested spaces. Perhaps more than any other architectural element, it's the ease of navigation that makes Hadid's design so special. \"The terminal layouts minimize the walking distances between check-in and gate, and also the distances between gates for transferring passengers, to a maximum of eight minutes by foot,\" says Cristiano Ceccato, ZHA's project director for the Beijing Daxing airport. \"Transferring passengers only need to walk a short distance to the center of the airport, then quickly and efficiently funnel themselves to any other of the four legs in the airport. What's more, the international and domestic passengers are stacked on different levels. By stacking the international and domestic areas vertically-instead of spreading them horizontally-we enable a more congestion-free space for passengers.\" Beijing's newest airport, which is a 20-minute express train ride from the Daxing District, has a starfish design, with each of its legs handling over a dozen gates. The center point where passengers move through, which Ceccato alluded to, was inspired by traditional Chinese architecture. Much like the traditional structures within the country, the central thoroughfare acts as a sort of courtyard, allowing passengers to easily navigate their way around the massive space. The rooftop, which allows in ample natural sunlight, also has supporting beams that move constantly through the space, acting like lines toward the central courtyard. This, once more, was intentionally done to assist passengers in their navigation of the busy airport. We live in a digital epoch of architecture that has allowed fantastical buildings to shift from the theoretical to the materialized. Yet that doesn't always mean that computer-enhanced designs will be admired, or stand the test of time. It's too soon to tell what future generations will think of Zaha Hadid's Beijing Daxing International Airport. For now, however, the design has shown that alchemy is still possible in modern architecture.

Designed by the late Zaha Hadid and current studio principal Patrik Schumacher, along with airport specialist ADPI, the 700,000-square-metre terminal to serve Beijing has been designed to be as compact as possible. The airport is arranged around a central \"grand courtyard\" with five aircraft piers radiating directly out to give the building the appearance of a starfish from above. The four-storey airport is arranged around this central space, which is naturally lit with a glass roof that the studio refers to as a \"central orientation space dome\". The airport's check-in island, international and domestic security desks and domestic retail area are all arranged on different levels within this central area. \"Echoing principles within traditional Chinese architecture that organise interconnected spaces around a central courtyard, the terminal's design guides all passengers seamlessly through the relevant departure, arrival or transfer zones towards the grand courtyard at its centre - a multi- layered meeting space at the heart of the terminal,\" explained the studio. From the central space, passengers can board planes from the 79 gates, which each have airbridges connecting directly to the terminal, arranged around the five aircraft piers. According to the studio, this is the most efficient arrangement to quickly allow large numbers of passengers to quickly reach their planes. \"The compact radial design of the terminal allows a maximum number of aircraft to be parked directly at the terminal with minimum distances from the centre of the building, providing exceptional convenience for passengers and flexibility in operations,\" said the studio. \"This radial configuration ensures the farthest boarding gate can be accessed in a walking time of less than eighth minutes.\" Arranged around the main courtyard space, Zaha Hadid Architects has created a series of flowing forms that support the roof and act as skylights to bring light into the space. A sixth radiating arm contains the 80,000 square-metre transportation hub, which contains a high-speed and local rail stations, as well as a hotel and offices. The airport is powered by solar panels and has a centralised heating system with waste heat recovery supported by a ground-source heat pump. It also has a rainwater collection and water management system. Zaha Hadid Architects was founded in in 1980 by Hadid.

China Southern christened the airport with a flight to Guangdong, CBS reported, followed by other flights to Shanghai and beyond. The airport, designed by Zaha Hadid, measures more than 700,000 square meters, already making it the world's largest airport in terms of surface area. It has been nicknamed the \"starfish\" by local media for its resemblance to the animal, with several wings shooting off of one central point. The airport includes separate passenger areas for domestic and international travel. But despite its large size, the airport was designed to minimize how long passengers need to walk to get to their gate. According to CNN, it was designed so that passengers will not walk any longer than eight minutes to get from the security checkpoint to even the furthest gates. Beijing Daxing will be capable of accommodating more than 100 million passengers per year once fully operational. However, it will take at least a few years to reach that capacity. The airport is also expected to boast some high-tech features. Customer service robots will roam the terminal and provide passengers with up-to-the- minute updates on flight status and weather. The airport also hopes to become a transportation hub, complete with high-speed rail. Express trains will be able to get passengers from the airport to the city center in less than 20 minutes. It is expected that the airport will have service to 112 destinations around the world by Spring 2020. China has one of the fastest-growing travel markets in the world. Of the 20 fastest-growing airports in the world, 11 are located in China alone.

The air traffic management system has been deployed to enhance the safety and efficiency of air traffic operations. Beijing Daxing International Airport, which was formally opened last week, is known as the world's largest single-terminal airport. It has deployed the TopSky-ATC air traffic management system, delivered by Thales and BEST, at its Beijing Terminal Maneuvering Area Control Centre. The system is capable of completing fallback flight data processing, flight plan synchronisation, multi-sensor processing and sending alerts to ensure consistent operations. Thales and Beijing EasySky Technology is a JV between Thales and the Civil Aviation Air Traffic Control Technology & Equipment Development Company. North China Air Traffic Management Bureau selected the JV to provide an air traffic control automation system to update the Beijing TMA Control Centre in 2016. The project involved the automation of Beijing TMA, Beijing Area Control Centre, ATC towers at Beijing Capital International Airport and the new Beijing Daxing International Airport, Tianjin Approach and the ATC tower at Tianjin Binhai International Airport. With this synchronisation, the ATC system in China is said to become the largest in the world. Around 290 controller working positions cover the country's northern region. Thales MAESTRO AMAN and DMAN technology was first deployed by the Beijing TMA Control Centre for sequencing and balancing the airport's traffic flow and airspace. The system is said to decrease flight delays and increase air capacity. It provides a seamless integration between area control, approach control and tower systems. Thales has also provided navaids and ATM radars for safety surveillance and navigation services at Daxing Airport. Thales North China vice-president J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bendell said: \"Thales has been partnering with China aerospace industry on traffic management technology since the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and China. \"The group is proud of its history in the country and of having helped the growth of Sino-French cooperation in aerospace. Thales's long-term engagement in China is once again reaffirmed. The group is a committed and key partner in China's journey to becoming a more digitalised and innovative country.\"", "url": "https://www.airport-technology.com/news/daxing-airport-thales-best-atc/"}, {"title": "British Airways touches down at Beijing Daxing airport", "date": "2019-10-28", "content": "British Airways has switched its Heathrow-Beijing service to the new Daxing International, becoming the first international carrier to use the airport since it opened last month.

Safety has always been a basic requirement for the airport. Millimeter-wave doors can cover areas beyond the reach of metal detectors. Authorities have also introduced a supervision system for runways, and radar can detect even a small stone in an aircraft's path. A light-guidance system allows pilots to direct planes in very low visibility conditions. \"We have taken a variety of measures to guarantee passengers' information safety,\" said Li Tao, with the airport's information management department. \"For example, after storing your ID information, the system will turn it into a code unrecognizable to the public. We can also supervise and stop cyber threats and attacks.\" Authorities have implemented the strictest standards to prevent noise pollution at the airport, and all waste is treated so that it poses no threat to the environment. \"We also decided to make the Daxing airport a 'sponge airport,' where the main buildings can store rainwater and all polluted water can be recycled,\" said Du. Daxing is a smart airport, boasting roughly 62,000 information points and more than 4,000 internet-enabled devices. Facial recognition technology allows passengers to check in, pass through security, board planes, claim tax refunds, and shop, just by scanning their faces. A small chip in each luggage tag helps passengers to track their luggage easily, said Hao Ling, the airport's deputy general manager.

With COVID hammering capacity at the airport, it hasn't seen anything like the growth it had hoped for. Nevertheless, it has been rapidly bouncing back from its difficult start and currently handles 43% of the city's capacity. Daxing had a tough first year: It's been well over a year since Beijing's new airport opened its runways to the world. Daxing Airport was set to be a massive boon for China, but nothing could have prepared it for what happened in its first year of opening. A year that should have been marked by exponential growth and the arrival of new airlines has instead seen capacity plummet to almost nothing as the COVID crisis halted almost all international travel. But, like a beach ball in a swimming pool, you can't keep a good airport down for long. Research by OAG has shown just how much the airport has bounced back, registering 10% more domestic traffic in November 2020 than it did last year. The recovery of Daxing had been relatively parallel to that of neighboring Beijing Capital until around August. Since then, PKX has really ramped up capacity, and the gap between the two airports in terms of seat capacity has grown wider and wider. By November, Daxing was handling 43% of Beijing's entire capacity. Where are airlines flying from Daxing? Building back its route network has been tough for Daxing. Whereas a year ago airlines were flying both locally and to destinations in Europe and South East Asia, now the route map is limited to just domestic service. Any of the limited international flights that are coming out from China are all currently operating via Beijing Capital. OAG states that, last month, airlines flew 5.1 million seats from Beijing in total on 186 routes. 137 of these fly from Capital and 121 from Daxing. The most popular of these was Shanghai, for which the majority of flights departed from PKK. However, there are some routes where Daxing holds the crown. In particular, for fights to Guangzhou Airport, the second most popular destination from Beijing, PKX handled more than half of all flights. Sanya flights were about 50/50 between the two airports, while Daxing took care of the majority of flights to the destinations of Kunming, Pudong and Wuhan. These numbers are a reflection of the carriers who have moved wholeheartedly into Daxing. China Southern, for instance, has entirely moved to the new airport and currently holds some 45% of the overall capacity there. With hopes that a vaccine could herald the start of more relaxed international movements, it will be interesting to see the international capacity start to pick up at Daxing. Many international operators made the switch to the new airport, including Delta, LOT Polish, and pretty much all of the on world operators.

The venue consists of a preface hall and main gallery lit by 15 Christie DWU850-GS 1DLP laser projectors, which were supplied, installed and commissioned by Christie's longstanding partner, Wincomn Technology. Themed 'The Four Seasons by Masters of Art', visitors can enjoy digital projections of eight art masterpieces on the walls and floor of the pavilion covering an area of 130m 2. These include Vincent van Gogh's Almond Blossoms, Green Wheat Field with Cypress, The Starry Night, Sunflowers, The Harvest and Wild Roses, as well as Oscar-Claude Monet's Water Lilies and Floes at Bennecourt. \"The 'Journey of Light and Shadow' digital experience pavilion is an innovative cultural space that enable visitors to relax and admire world famous art pieces in an unprecedented manner - through highly immersive projections that make them feel as if they're part of the paintings,\" said Tony Chen, general manager at Wincomn Technology. \"We are very excited to be involved in this significant project, particularly with the projection design, and have pulled out all the stops to create an awe-inspiring, contemporary digital art gallery using the tried-and-tested Christie GS Series 1DLP laser projectors, which we are very familiar with.\" Wincomn adopted front projection using ultra-short throw lens to display visuals in landscape format on all surfaces. This enabled all images presented on the walls of the preface hall and main gallery to be seamlessly integrated and completely filled from top to bottom. An overhead structure was also erected for the projectors to be suitably installed as it was architecturally difficult to mount them on the ceiling. In this way, usable space can be fully utilized, and the projections will be free from any interference by visitors.
