The U.S. Navy's two GE LM2500+ gas turbines are the main propulsion source and are used when full speed is required, as gas is used in hybrid cars when full power is needed. Power Conversion's APS, or electrical drive train, is connected to the same propeller shafts, similar to the electric portion of a hybrid vehicle. The purpose of the APS is to provide a fuel-saving alternative, compared to the gas turbine engines, during low-speed operations, which is when the gas turbines are less fuel efficient than an electrical propulsion system.

According to a U.S. Navy brief from 2015: LHA 7 is being built as a repeat of the LHA 6 with very limited changes to the design. After delivery of LHA 6, a group of significant changes to the ship's flight deck structure and equipment were necessary to accommodate the F-35B aircraft. These improvements are being incorporated into the basic build of LHA 7, which is expected to yield a better overall technical solution at reduced cost. The ship can also carry an assault force of around 1,800 U.S. Marines and amphibious warfare equipment, next to a crew of about 1,200.

The shipbuilder cited unspecified technical difficulties as the reason for the delays. Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls Industries' (HII) CEO, made the announcement in a quarterly earnings call with reporters on Aug. 1, 2019. The Navy had planned to commission the future Tripoli, which completed builders trials in July, some time this fall, but this will now not occur until the very end of the year, at the earliest. HII launched the ship in 2017 and had delivered the first-in-class USS America to the Navy three years earlier. \"The systems are working today. It's just a question of whether they will work for the life of the ship,\" Petters explained, according to USNI News. \"We're working through a couple of technical design issues that we're working and discussing with the Navy about.\" Petters added that HII was in talks with the Navy about whether or not all of the deficiencies need to be resolved before commissioning. He declined to give any details about the issues specifically. \"We think that'll come to a resolution around the end of the year, and predicting whether it's the end of this year or the beginning the next year, we don't want to put up sort of any extra pressure on that,\" Petters continued. \"We want to resolve that the right way.\" The Navy made no mention of any possibility of a delay in commissioning when it announced the future Tripoli had finished builders trials on July 19, 2019. \"The Navy and industry team did a commendable job this week,\" Tom Rivers, the Amphibious Warfare Program Manager within the service's Program Executive Office Ships said at the time. That HII has specifically framed the reason for the delay as \"technical design issues,\" rather than, say, quality control problems, further raises the question about whether these deficiencies might be related to past difficulties with the first-in-class USS America and whether that ship might still suffer from similar problems years after formally entering service. In its review of developments relating to the America class in the 2018 Fiscal Year, the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) did highlight a number of remaining issues with USS America, which is also known by its hull number LHA 6. \"Operational testing demonstrated that LHA 6 is effective at supporting some Marine Corps missions, but testing was not adequate to demonstrate effectiveness at supporting the full Marine Corps range of operations,\" the report, which DOT&E published in March 2019, said. \"The movement of marines, cargo, and vehicles executed during testing was insufficient to generate a realistic operational tempo required by the Operational Test Agencies for an adequate operational test.\" One of the core questions that remains is about whether America and the future Tripoli will be able to support the operations of a full complement of 20 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters (JSF). \"The Navy will not complete the operational evaluation of the ship's ability to support a complement of 20 F-35B JSF aircraft until 2021,\" DOT&E reported in March. The Navy has conducted evaluations with smaller numbers of F-35s. This is a major issue since these two America class ships lack the well deck found on past Navy classes of amphibious assault ship and is focused primarily on aviation operations, including those involving the F-35B. The third America class ship, the future USS Bougainville, features a significantly revised design that includes a well deck and will form a subclass unto itself. The War Zone has previously examined the differences in the America class subvariants and their associated concepts of operation in depth. In addition, previous tests identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities in a number of unspecified networked systems on America, which DOT&E has said \"could adversely affect operational effectiveness in a cyber-contested environment\" in the past. Beyond that, the Navy has not completed a required trial to assess how vulnerable the America class ships are to naval mines, an increasingly worrisome threat, particularly in the Middle East, as of September 2018. Despite the issues, in 2017, America had left for her first operational deployment, which included visits to the Western Pacific and the Middle East. In January 2019, the Navy also announced that it would forward deploy the first-in-class ship to Japan, where it could become the flagship of U.S. Seventh Fleet's amphibious forces, taking the place of the older first-in-class USS Wasp, which would return the United States. The delay in commissioning the future Tripoli also comes amid a spate of issues with other high profile Navy shipbuilding programs in recent years. The most notable of these has been the ongoing troubles with the first-in-class aircraft USS Gerald R. Ford, which continue to plague the ship and effectively prevent it from conducting any real combat operations, if necessary, in its present form, two years after its commissioning. It remains to be seen how serious the technical issues with the future Tripoli actually are, as well as if they reflect larger deficiencies with the America class design. Hopefully, the delay in commissioning the ship will be relatively minor and HII will be able to resolve the outstanding issues quickly.", "url": "https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29253/delivery-of-newest-america-class-amphibious-assault-ship-delayed-over-technical-issues"}, {"title": "U.S. Navy & HII Complete Acceptance Trials for Amphibious Assault Ship Tripoli (LHA 7)", "date": "2019-10-29", "content": "The future USS Tripoli (LHA 7) completed acceptance trials when she returned to the Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII)-Ingalls Shipbuilding Division's shipyard following three days underway in the Gulf of Mexico.

Both the hanger deck, parts and equipment stowage, aviation fuel capacity, and aviation maintenance facilities on the ship are expanded compared to previous Flight 0 designs. \"The capability that our large deck amphibs bring to the fight is tremendous,\" said Tom Rivers, amphibious warfare program manager for Program Executive Office (PEO) Ships. \"Their ability to embark F-35 B Joint Strike Fighters and MV-22 Osprey enable this versatile platform to increase the lethality of our expeditionary warfighters.\"", "url": "https://www.overtdefense.com/2019/11/04/uss-tripoli-lha-7-passes-navy-testing-before-commissioning/"}, {"title": "New USS Tripoli Nearing Completion", "date": "2019-12-17", "content": "The future USS Tripoli is in the homestretch of construction at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi; about six months out from its commissioning ceremony in Pensacola. Members of the Pensacola group putting on the festivities, including the commissioning committee and Navy League, recently got a brief tour of the ship. In this segment installment, we learn more details about the ship, its crew and efforts to be more environment- and health-conscious. Tripoli (LHA 7), now referred to as a Pre-Commissioning Unit, is 845 feet long and weighs 45,000 tons. As part of the tour, Commanding Officer Capt. Kevin Meyers, and select members of his crew, lead the Pensacola group from the flight deck down ladder wells and through narrow passageways. \"Oops, up this way,\" said Capt. Meyers, still learning his way around the brand new ship. \"Yeah, we're going to \"skin\" back around. We took you down a detour.\" This brief detour results in a quick peek at sleeping quarters, specifically this is a Marine Corps berthing area, designated so with red paint. Capt. Meyers says the berthing areas are designed to accommodate three or four Marine officers, with two or three Navy officers to a space, \"And, for our junior officers, it'll be four. Four is the most for officers.\" For the enlisted personnel, there could be 40 to 50 sharing sleeping quarters. The Navy's newest amphibious assault ship, Tripoli is like a small carrier, designed to support Marine Corps operations and aircraft and host as many as 1,800 Marines. This is the third U.S. warship to carry the historic name and it's the third new construction vessel for Capt. Meyers, who took time out to conduct the tour. We learned a lot from the ship's wardroom, which is a reference to how the space was used dating back to colonial days. \"If you go back to the three-masted ships, you know you were engaged in close order battle, and if you had injuries and where were you going to take the injured people that was quiet and somewhere out of the way and safe,\" the captain said, explaining how the medical ward became the wardroom. The tables are still about six to six and a half feet long, as they were centuries ago, to accommodate a body for medical treatment or even surgery. But, Capt. Meyers points out that the Navy has come a long way since then, \"Our surgical capability now on this ship is pretty robust; it's essentially a miniature hospital.\" As to its medical capabilities, Tripoli has two operating rooms, three intensive care units, a 12-bed medical ward, X-ray facilities, pharmacy and lab. That leaves the wardroom to function as a dining and meeting space for Navy and Marine officers aboard the ship. \"Eventually, we'll load up television sets for PowerPoint briefings and other briefings in there, and then there are wardroom lounges around,\" added the captain. While in the wardroom, a member of the Pensacola group points to a feature known as a compartment bullseye, painted in the shape of a square on the back wall. It's a series of letters and numbers, designed to glow in the dark, that yield essential information about the location, size, and function of the space. \"We're above the main decks, you know, two decks above, 01 then 02.,\" said Meyers in reference to what the first numbers in the sequence mean. Such data can be crucial in times of emergency. \"Every space is designated with a bullseye that goes into a thing called the Repair Party Manual, which if we went down at the damage control central, the damage control assistant can open that up,\" he continued. The manual will include the dimensions of the space, and will provide information on whether it can be flooded to help stabilize the ship. Getting back to the function of the wardroom as a dining facility for officers, there's also a Chiefs Mess and separate mess for enlisted personnel. \"When we have the full complement, our crew is about a thousand, give or take. And, if we embark, Marines will be 1,800 or so, give or take; so, 2,800 people, at least three-and-half times a day,\" Meyers said. Capacity is about 12,000 meals a day aboard ship. According to the captain, the supply crew, cooks and attendants are almost always in, either cutting, carving, shaving, baking or cleaning. To get a different view, we head from the wardroom down to one of the crew dining areas, which is capable of serving up to 120 individuals per sitting. \"In the wardroom you can pull a chair out and sit down in a gentlemanly fashion,\" said Meyers, pointing out that the chairs have been welded to the tables in the enlisted mess. Additionally, officers get regular plates and flatware, while enlisted crewmembers get their food on trays. However, efforts are being made to improve the overall quality of the food, by providing healthier options. \"We all run what we call 21-day, pre-formatted meal,\" Meyers noted. \"We used to have deep fat fryers, but all that's gone away. Now, you can have some baked fries, tater tots, whatever.\" When it comes to clean up, the captain is proud to highlight the new, more environmentally-friendly method of handling plastic waste. \"You shred it up and then you throw it in a \"melter,\" and it melts it and it comes out in little pieces that are about a quarter inch thick and about this big around. And, you spray some deodorant on them so they don't smell, you throw them in bags and then when you come back into port, you dispose of them,\" he explained of their determination to be more conscience of sea life, such as turtles and dolphins. \"So, we don't throw the plastics overboard anymore.\" After hanging out in the enlisted mess for a bit, we're ready to embark on the final leg of our tour. Along the way, we walk through a very noisy, but important space, according to the ship's Mass Communications Specialist Julian Moorefield, \"Right now we're in the hangar bay; that's where all the aircraft will be worked on.\" Before long, we're back in the elevator and back on the dock, underneath the ship. \"If the ship falls off the blocks, your hard hat and your steel toes will protect you. You'll be fine. Safety first,\" joked the captain. Here, looking up at the ship's huge port side propeller, we're reminded that there's a bit more work to be done before future USS Tripoli is ready to go. \"Working on what we call fit and finish, making sure paint and everything is exactly the way it should be. Then the crew will move aboard, then we'll start our training cycle and then we'll come over to Pensacola to get commissioned.\" Currently, the commissioning ceremony is scheduled for June, although no final date has been set. In our final report, we'll meet two crew members, who've already reported for duty. The balance of the ship's crew is expected to report in late February.", "url": "https://www.wuwf.org/local-news/2019-12-17/new-uss-tripoli-nearing-completion"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Navy Accepts Delivery of Future USS Tripoli", "date": "2020-02-28", "content": "The Navy accepted delivery of the future USS Tripoli, the Navy's newest America-class amphibious assault ship, from Huntington Ingalls Industries -Ingalls Shipbuilding Division on Feb. 28.

The \"Lightning Carrier\" concept has been tossed about for years by Marines and the F-35 program office. \"It just worked out perfectly with the opportunity for us to practice and train with the MAG,\" Vaughn said, adding that operational testers with VMX-1 are aboard Tripoli this week evaluating lessons learned from the F-35B operations. The concept takes a page from history. In the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD-5) and USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6) were dubbed the \"Harrier carriers,\" each supporting two squadrons of AV-8B Harrier attack jets for Commander Task Force 51 as U.S. and combined forces pushed toward Baghdad.

The NMESIS was tested to see if it will fit in the confines of the hangar, drive up the vehicle ramp leading to the Flight Deck, and fit and drive through the vehicle doors of the amphibious ship. The NMESIS will form a key component in U.S. Marine Corps' Commandant General David Berger's Force Design 2030 strategy to counter peer nation shipping in the Indian Pacific Command (INDO-PACOM) region with stealthy sea-skimming programmable and survivable Anti-Ship missiles. The United States Marine Corps' (USMC) Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) is an unmanned 4\u00d74 wheeled Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) that can transport two stealthy 100+ kilometer Naval Strike Missiles (NSMs) for Anti-Ship Area Denial Missions. Being able to drive itself by remote control, the NMESIS increases U.S. Marine battlefield survivability and concealment and is also able to fire remotely. The USMC intends to field NMESIS by FY2023 as a counter to amphibious assaults and adversary shipping in the INDO-PACOM and Asian Pacific Rim (RIMPAC) region. The JLTV NMESIS is also able to be transported via U.S. Navy Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) and Surface-to-Shore Connector (SSC) hovercrafts and small utility boat connectors, inside a USMC KC-130 cargo plane, and slung underneath a USMC CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter. The NMESIS JLTVs should be able to be embarked and deployed from the upcoming Light Amphibious Warships (LAW) that are intended to cruise the RIMPAC region on missions lasting around thirty days with 75 Marines and their associated vehicles embarked aboard. By deploying USMC's NMESIS and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) on various ships and islands in the INDO-PACOM region, the USMC hopes that these Long-range Precision Fires (LRPF) rocket and missile systems will act as an effective land and ship-based deterrent against any hostile invasion force. HIMARS has been tested to be able to fire from the Flight Deck of amphibious transport ships.

The 45,000-ton big-deck amphibious ship left San Diego to gather F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters that will include further testing of the Marine's \"lightning carrier\" concept, a defense official confirmed to USNI News. The lightning carrier can load up to 20 of the short take-off, vertically landing F-35s as an adjunct capability to a carrier strike group, USNI News understands. A U.S. 3rd Fleet spokesman confirmed to USNI News the big-deck left San Diego on Monday, but did not provide additional details on the deployment. Tripoli's departure comes just less than a month after the ship wrapped up a week of at-sea testing and training to prove the lightning carrier concept. Operating off Southern California, Tripoli took on at one point 20 F-35Bs, marking a major milestone in seeing how many of the fighters the Navy and Marine Corps could operate aboard the ship at one time. The F-35s came from three Marine Corps squadrons, officials said. They included the \"Vikings\" of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 225 and the \"Wake Island Avengers\" of VMFA-211, both based at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station, Ariz., and Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron 1, based at Yuma and New River, N.C. The advanced, multi-mission F-35Bs are replacing the Marine Corps' older F/A-18 Hornet and AV-8B Harrier jets. Navy officials have said little about what it plans to do with Tripoli following the recent at-sea training. Other big-deck amphibious assaults ships usually train and deploy as part of a three-ship Amphibious Ready Group that deploys with 2,200-member Marine Expeditionary Units, with their large well-decks supporting waterborne craft that provide significant Marine Corps capability in littoral operations. Tripoli, however, was designed to support air operations, centered around the F-35B. \"We refer to the ship as 'assault carrier 7.' And assault is traditional for an LHD, LHA,\" Capt. Joel Lang, the ship's commander, said during an April 3 media event aboard Tripoli. \"We have the space for a battalion landing team, we have about 1,000 infantrymen. And typically the air combat element is a blend of rotary and tilt-rotor in order to enable that assault force to go ashore. What we're doing right now is lightning carrier, and we are proving the operational concept. We are proving the tactics and the techniques and the procedures to employ the lightning carrier concept.\" When asked what the plans are for Tripoli once the training was completed, Lang said, \"I'm going to get ready to go over the horizon, and then be prepared to be tasked with one of those two concepts, and then offer the Navy and the Marine Corps, we have a relevant option - you've got two of them - and then just based on where we go in the world, what that contingency op is, they can employ one of those two concepts. So when we get home, that's what we're going to do. We're going to get ready to go over the horizon and be prepared to do one of these two once we get on the other side of the Earth.\" The arrival of Tripoli and a force of F-35Bs won't in any way displace the MEU, but will give regional commanders new options, said Col. Chad Vaughn, commander of Marine Aircraft Group 13. \"This is just an option... for contingency operations,\" said Vaughn, a veteran F/A-18 pilot who was among the first ones to transition to the F-35B. \"This ship just gives you an option.\" \"We're not an aircraft carrier,\" he said of Tripoli. \"We are an LHA that is very uniquely suited to aviation operations - whether that's an assault or in this case, a lightning carrier. The traditional carrier has capabilities that are unique that we do not. We do some unique things that we can help out the joint task force or the combatant commander and do unique things to help out those CVNs and help out the Marine commander on the ground, whoever it is. We have some unique capabilities, especially when you put 20 F-35s on here.\" It's unclear if Tripoli will transit the Pacific with additional amphibs, but it's time in the Western Pacific comes as the Navy's other aircraft-centric amphib - USS America (LHA-6) - is currently in a maintenance availability, USNI News understands.

Perry is one of the \"blue shirts\" on the flight deck responsible for securing aircraft to the flight deck with chocks and chains. \"We did more preparation ahead of time, so we could just grab what we needed and go.\" Tripoli's flight operations are controlled from primary flight control, located high above the flight deck. The officers on watch in Pri-Fly look down on the aircraft taxiing, launching and landing from large windows that allow them to see the whole length of the flight deck. Pri-Fly is similar to a control tower at an airport and teamwork between the Sailors on the deck and in Pri-Fly is essential. At night, that teamwork is even more important. \"We take for granted that we have a bird's eye view of everything that's going on up here, but at night we have limited visibility\" said Lt. Brian Isbell, Tripoli's safety officer. \"Pri-Fly personnel do have night vision goggles, but say it is still difficult to see. \"We really have to rely on the yellow shirts below to tell us what's going on.\" Yellow shirts serve as aircraft directors, shooters, and landing signalmen-enlisted. They guide the aircraft while taxiing, give launch signals, guide aircraft back on deck during recovery and are in charge of any additional aircraft movements on the flight deck. Because of the noise on deck, they use hand signals to communicate with pilots and other Sailors on the flight deck. Hand signals are not the only means of visual communication on the flight deck. The crew still has other cues they can rely on, such as deck lighting that helps determine the status of the deck where aircraft need to go. Those same cues also help the pilots. For them, flying at night from a ship at sea is a whole other world. \"Landing on a ship at night is a unique challenge,\" said U.S. Marine Corps Capt. John Mensch, an F-35B Lightning II pilot assigned to Maine Strike Fighter Squadron (VMFA) 121. \"One of the biggest challenges that comes with that is spatial orientation. You can't see where the horizon is,\" said Mensch. Another challenge is the way the ship looks at night. \"When you see it a few miles out, it's just lights suspended in space,\" said Mensch. \"You have to trust your instruments and trust your landing signal officers (LSO) to bring you aboard safely.\" LSOs are pilots who stand watch in Pri-Fly and provide essential guidance over the radio for launches, landings and help trouble shoot if there is an emergency. LSOs only work with fixed-wing aircraft like F-35s or its predecessor the AV-8B Harrier. Working in the dark does have some advantages though, such as a break from the south Pacific heat. Another is seeing what the flight deck and the environment look like at night. The deck glows from the various lights that aren't needed during the day. The stars are visible with a remarkable clarity due to the lack of light from other sources. Aside from the deck lighting, another source of light are the lighted hand wands the yellow shirts use to signal the pilots and crew during night operations. \"When you are first learning to communicate with wands, it feels confusing, but it's actually easier,\" said Aviation Boatswain's Mate 2nd Class Lawrence Pivec, one of Tripoli's aircraft directors or yellow shirts. \"The vocabulary with wands is smaller, and it's a lot easier to see signals with them farther down the flight deck.\" Eventually flight operations shifted back to the bright light of the sun, after Tripoli's crew proved they could accomplish any mission asked of them, day or night. Tripoli is operating in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations to enhance interoperability with allies and partners and serve as a ready response force to defend peace and maintain stability in the Indo-Pacific region.

With more than 2,400 Sailors and Marines, each of Tripoli's departments had an area of responsibility to ensure that the ship can support the MEU and their operations. \"Bringing the MEU aboard will be an opportunity to integrate as one Navy and Marine Corps team,\" said Lt. Joel Tidd, Tripoli's assistant supply officer. \"Challenges including longer chow lines and sharing both working and living spaces will be part of the new regular routine. However, our combined efforts will increase the mission ranges and lethality of Team Tripoli.\" Tripoli Sailors frequently onload supplies and stores while in port, and embarking the Marines in Okinawa was no exception. Tripoli received over 100 pallets of food, retail goods, general stores, and mail. \"Supply evolutions in port are a team effort by over 200 outstanding supply department Sailors and Marines to re-supply and replenish our storerooms, receive and distribute mail and care packages, offload trash and hazardous waste, all while providing daily customer service support,\" said Tidd. In addition to the efforts of Supply department, Weapons department was equally busy handling all of the MEU's small arms, as well as preparing ordnance for missions. \"There are more weapons onboard and now the majority of the weapons belong to the 31st MEU,\" said Lt. Cmdr. Kenneth Davis, Tripoli's Weapons department head. \"Random spot checks of the berthings and armory by the Marines, G2 division, and the weapons duty officers is paramount.\" Every member of the MEU's ground combat element (GCE) brought their rifle. It was Weapons department's responsibility for turning over all of the rifle rack locks to the troop armory staff noncommissioned officer, and verify all rifle rack tuff locks properly operated. However, the MEU onload was not all business after working hours; Tripoli and MEU personnel experienced liberty in Okinawa. Sailors and Marines took to the beach to unwind. Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) White Beach provided buses to and from Kadena Air Force Base where personnel shopped at the base Exchange. \"It was a pleasant surprise to have the beach access and our beachside trailer so close to the ship,\" said Aviation Ordnanceman 3rd Class Christopher Carlson from Buckley, Washington. \"Out of all of the ports we've been to, Okinawa is my favorite. The waters here are crystal clear, and I just enjoyed hanging out with my friends on the beach.\" Currently, Tripoli and the 31st MEU are completing integrated training.

Tripoli 's stop in Singapore marks its first port visit since it pulled into Naval Base White Beach, Okinawa and embarked the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit on July 25. Prior to embarking the 31st MEU, Tripoli had been operating under the \"lightning carrier\" concept, in which it had more than a dozen F-35Bs aboard during its Pacific deployment.

The latest amphibious assault ship of the US Navy, the USS Tripoli (LHA-7), recently arrived at the Changi Naval Base in Singapore days after navigating the waters of the South China Sea. Tripoli is the second America-class amphibious assault vessel built in the mid-2010s and commissioned to service in July 2020. At the height of the brewing tension between the US and China, Tripoli departed Naval Station San Diego en route to the Western Pacific Ocean to embark on her maiden deployment on May 2022. During its voyage, the amphibious assault vessel participated in a \"lightning carrier\" trial concept with 20 F-35Bs onboard. By April, Tripoli can now operate as a capable vessel, either as a lightning carrier or an amphibious assault platform, with the latter serving only as a contingency option, given that the ship is primarily a dedicated Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA). \"We're not an aircraft carrier,\" said Vaughn, a veteran F/A-18 pilot who was among the first to transition to the F-35B. \"We are an LHA that is very uniquely suited to aviation operations-whether that's an assault or, in this case, a lightning carrier.\" Tripoli successfully transitioned to an amphibious-ready role two years after entering service, launching the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit at Naval Base Okinawa, Japan, on July 25, after which steered across the South China Sea to make a port call at Singapore's Changi Naval Base on Wednesday, August 31. As Tripoli left the Naval Base Okinawa, China's warships began to appear in sea waters near Japan. According to a news report, \"a Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) surface action group transited the Tsushima Strait on Tuesday into the Sea of Japan.\" Below is the timeline as reported by the Japan Ministry of Defenses beginning August 28 to 31: Sunday, August 28 - A PLAN Dongdiao-class intelligence ship traversed southeast through the waters between Okinawa and Miyako Island into the Pacific Ocean to which the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) immediately took action in monitoring the activities of the PLAN ships using its destroyer JS Fuyuzuki (DD-118) and a JMSDF P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft of Fleet Air Wing 5 operating from Naha Air Base, Okinawa. Tuesday, August 30 - Another group of PLAN ships were spotted 240 km southwest of Tsushima, comprised of three warships, including destroyer CNS Nanchang (101), frigate CNS Yancheng, and replenishment ship CNS Dongpinghu (902). In addition, JMSDF sent its fast attack crafts JS Otaka (PG-826) and JS Umitaka (PG-828), along with a JMSDF P-1 MPA of Fleet Air Wing 4 operating from Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Honshu, to watch over the PLAN ships. Wednesday, August 31 - Japan Ministry of Defense reported seeing a PLAN destroyer CNS Zibo (156) sailing north-northeast of Miyako Island and then southeast through the Miyako Strait into the Pacific Ocean. A JMSDF P-3C Orion MPA from Fleet Air Wing 5 was dispatched to keep an eye on the ship. While PLAN appeared to be on to something, the activities of these warships near Japan's waters are actually currently participating in the Russian Vostok 2022 exercise, which will take place over the next few days. Global Times reported that the PLAN Northern Theater Command partook in this year's Russian military drill, sending about \"2,000 personnel, more than 300 vehicles of various types, 21 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and three warships.\" Moreover, the Chinese and Russian navies will conduct anti-ship and anti-submarine defense drills in the Sea of Japan, focusing on strengthening defenses in sea lanes and areas of maritime economic activity and assisting ground forces. \"While the drills are not aimed at a third party and are not related to current events, analysts say they serve as a deterrent against uncertainties such as ill-intended external forces, hegemony, and power politics, and that China and Russia's military cooperation will contribute to peace and stability in the region,\" the report added. Amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Russia will be sending out tens of thousands of troops to join in the military exercise along with tanks, APCs, artillery, aircraft, warships, boats, and support vessels. Other countries, including Algeria, India, Belarus, Tajikistan, Mongolia, and more, are expected to be present at the Vostok-2022 maneuvers. Meanwhile, the Pacific Vanguard 2022 military exercise, which included the Royal Australian Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, JMSDF, Republic of Korea Navy, and the US Navy, recently concluded in Guam. According to a press release from the US 7th Fleet, the exercise was \"designed to provide training that emphasizes integrated task group maritime training and maneuver in a challenging exercise environment. It allows the US and its allies to be equipped and ready to respond to crises and contingencies in a changing Indo-Pacific.\" ", "url": "https://sofrep.com/news/chinese-warship-uss-tripoli-singapore-2022/"}, {"title": "USS Tripoli to join PH-US Exercise 'Kamandag' in October", "date": "2022-09-28", "content": "USS Tripoli (LHA-7), a United States Navy amphibious assault ship, will remain docked in Manila until October as it is set to participate in the Exercise Kamandag, the Philippine Navy (PN) disclosed Wednesday, Sept. 28.

And so it just is a very versatile instrument and the fact that you have 14 5th-gen fighters on board - it's an incredibly capable sensor,\" U.S. 7th Fleet commander Vice Adm. Karl Thomas said in October of the concept and testing. \"And so we're still in the experimentation phase. We wanted to at least try to find out how would you integrate an assault carrier with a full-sized carrier.
