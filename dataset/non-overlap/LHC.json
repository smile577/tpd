[{"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "CERN announces start-up date for LHC", "date": "2008-08-07", "content": "CERN1 has today announced that the first attempt to circulate a beam in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be made on 10 September. This news comes as the cool down phase of commissioning CERN's new particle accelerator reaches a successful conclusion. Television coverage of the start-up will be made available through Eurovision. The LHC is the world's most powerful particle accelerator, producing beams seven times more energetic than any previous machine, and around 30 times more intense when it reaches design performance, probably by 2010. Housed in a 27-kilometre tunnel, it relies on technologies that would not have been possible 30 years ago. The LHC is, in a sense, its own prototype. Starting up such a machine is not as simple as flipping a switch. Commissioning is a long process that starts with the cooling down of each of the machine's eight sectors. This is followed by the electrical testing of the 1600 superconducting magnets and their individual powering to nominal operating current. These steps are followed by the powering together of all the circuits of each sector, and then of the eight independent sectors in unison in order to operate as a single machine. By the end of July, this work was approaching completion, with all eight sectors at their operating temperature of 1.9 degrees above absolute zero (-271\u00b0C). The next phase in the process is synchronization of the LHC with the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) accelerator, which forms the last link in the LHC's injector chain. Timing between the two machines has to be accurate to within a fraction of a nanosecond. A first synchronization test is scheduled for the weekend of 9 August, for the clockwise-circulating LHC beam, with the second to follow over the coming weeks. Tests will continue into September to ensure that the entire machine is ready to accelerate and collide beams at an energy of 5 TeV per beam, the target energy for 2008. Force majeure notwithstanding, the LHC will see its first circulating beam on 10 September at the injection energy of 450 GeV (0.45 TeV). Once stable circulating beams have been established, they will be brought into collision, and the final step will be to commission the LHC's acceleration system to boost the energy to 5 TeV, taking particle physics research to a new frontier. 'We're finishing a marathon with a sprint,' said LHC project leader Lyn Evans. 'It's been a long haul, and we're all eager to get the LHC research programme underway.' CERN will be issuing regular status updates between now and first collisions. Journalists wishing to attend CERN for the first beam on 10 September must be accredited with the CERN press office. Since capacity is limited, priority will be given to news media. The event will be webcast here, and distributed through the Eurovision network. Live stand up and playout facilities will also be available. A media centre will be established at the main CERN site, with access to the control centres for the accelerator and experiments limited and allocated on a first come first served basis. This includes camera positions at the CERN Control Centre, from where the LHC is run. Only television media will be able to access the CERN Control Centre. No underground access will be possible.", "url": "https://press.cern/news/press-release/cern/cern-announces-start-date-lhc"}, {"title": "First beam in the LHC", "date": "2008-09-10", "content": "The first beam in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN1 was successfully steered around the full 27 kilometres of the world's most powerful particle accelerator at 10h28 this morning. This historic event marks a key moment in the transition from over two decades of preparation to a new era of scientific discovery. \"It's a fantastic moment,\" said LHC project leader Lyn Evans, \"we can now look forward to a new era of understanding about the origins and evolution of the universe.\" Starting up a major new particle accelerator takes much more than flipping a switch. Thousands of individual elements have to work in harmony, timings have to be synchronized to under a billionth of a second, and beams finer than a human hair have to be brought into head-on collision. Today's success puts a tick next to the first of those steps, and over the next few weeks, as the LHC's operators gain experience and confidence with the new machine, the machine's acceleration systems will be brought into play, and the beams will be brought into collision to allow the research programme to begin. Once colliding beams have been established, there will be a period of measurement and calibration for the LHC's four major experiments, and new results could start to appear in around a year. Experiments at the LHC will allow physicists to complete a journey that started with Newton's description of gravity. Gravity acts on mass, but so far science is unable to explain the mechanism that generates mass. Experiments at the LHC will provide the answer. LHC experiments will also try to probe the mysterious dark matter of the universe - visible matter seems to account for just 5% of what must exist, while about a quarter is believed to be dark matter. They will investigate the reason for nature's preference for matter over antimatter, and they will probe matter as it existed at the very beginning of time. \"The LHC is a discovery machine,\" said CERN Director General Robert Aymar, \"its research programme has the potential to change our view of the Universe profoundly, continuing a tradition of human curiosity that's as old as mankind itself.\" Tributes have been coming in from laboratories around the world that have contributed to today's success. \"The completion of the LHC marks the start of a revolution in particle physics,\" said Pier Oddone, Director of the US Fermilab. \"We commend CERN and its member countries for creating the foundation for many nations to come together in this magnificent enterprise. We appreciate the support that DOE and NSF have provided throughout the LHC's construction. We in the US are proud to have contributed to the accelerator and detectors at the LHC, together with thousands of colleagues around the world with whom we share this quest.\" \"I congratulate you on the start-up of the Large Hadron Collider,\" said Atsuto Suzuki, Director of Japan's KEK laboratory, \"This is a historical moment.\" \"It has been a fascinating and rewarding experience for us,\" said Vinod C. Sahni, Director of India's Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, \"I extend our best wishes to CERN for a productive run with the LHC machine in the years to come.\" \"As some might say: 'One short trip for a proton, but one giant leap for mankind!' TRIUMF, and indeed all of Canada, is delighted to bear witness to this amazing feat,\" said Nigel S. Lockyer, Director of Canada's TRIUMF laboratory. \"Everyone has been involved but CERN is to be especially congratulated for bringing the world together to embark on such an incredible adventure.\" In a visit to CERN shortly before the LHC's start-up United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon said: \"I am very honored to visit CERN, an invaluable scientific institution and a shining example what international community can achieve through joint efforts and contribution. I convey my deepest admiration to all the scientists and wish them all the success for their research for peaceful development of scientific progress.\" CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is the world's leading laboratory for particle physics.

To get beams around the ring in both directions on the first day exceeded all expectations, and the success continued through the night, with several hundred orbits being achieved. The next step in the commissioning process is to bring in the radio-frequency (RF) system that keeps the beams bunched, rather than spreading out around the ring, and will eventually accelerate them to 7 TeV. The RF system works by 'capturing' the beam, speeding up the slower moving particles and slowing down the faster ones so that the beam remains bunched into fine threads about 11 cm long. Without it, the beam quickly dissipates and cannot be used for physics. On Thursday night, 11 September, beam two, the anti-clockwise beam, was captured and circulated for over half an hour before being safely extracted from the LHC. The next step is to repeat the process for beam one, and that is set to begin this week. The intervening time has been spent recovering cryogenic conditions after the failure of a power transformer on one of the surface points of the LHC switched off the main compressors of the cryogenics for two sectors of the machine. The transformer, weighing 30 tonnes and with a rating of 12 MVA, was exchanged over the weekend. During this process, the cryogenics system was put into a standby mode with the two sectors kept at around 4.5 K. Since the beginning of the week the cryogenics team have been busy re-cooling the magnets and preparing for operation with beam, which is currently forecast for today. The next stage of the commissioning will be single turn studies using beam one, followed by RF capture and circulating beam in both rings. The LHC is on course for first collisions in a matter of weeks.

Preliminary investigations indicate that the most likely cause of the problem was a faulty electrical connection between two magnets, which probably melted at high current leading to mechanical failure. CERN 's strict safety regulations ensured that at no time was there any risk to people. A full investigation is underway, but it is already clear that the sector will have to be warmed up for repairs to take place. This implies a minimum of two months down time for LHC operation. For the same fault, not uncommon in a normally conducting machine, the repair time would be a matter of days. Further details will be made available as soon as they are known.", "url": "https://press.cern/news/press-release/cern/incident-lhc-sector-3-4"}, {"title": "Collider halted until next year", "date": "2008-09-23", "content": "The Large Hadron Collider near Geneva will be shut off until spring 2009 while engineers probe a magnet failure. The incident on 19 September caused a tonne of liquid helium to leak out into the experiment's 27km-long tunnel. Officials said the time required to fully investigate the problem precluded a re-start before the lab's winter maintenance period. The collider is built to smash protons together at huge speeds, recreating conditions moments after the Big Bang. Scientists hope it will shed light on fundamental questions in physics. \"Coming immediately after the very successful start of LHC operation on 10 September, this is undoubtedly a psychological blow,\" said Robert Aymar, director-general of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern), in a statement. But he praised the skill and preparation of the teams involved in building the particle accelerator. High priority: A spokesman for Cern told BBC News it was unclear at this stage when the collider could re-start operations after the lab's regular winter shut-down - which is partly done to save money on electricity during this period of peak demand. A number of factors could affect when the lab re-opened, including prolonged cold weather. \"It's usually around late March or early April that we start re-commissioning the whole accelerator chain. The LHC being at the end of that chain,\" said James Gillies, Cern's director of communications. \"It will take us a while to get beams injected into the LHC, but I think it's fair to say this will be the priority for next year's start-up.\" The accelerator chain prepares the beams of protons to be fired through the machine to make possible the collisions that physicists will use to study the make-up of our Universe. The problem occurred last weekend, when a failure, known as a quench, caused around 100 of the LHC's super-cooled magnets to heat up by as much as 100 degrees. The fire brigade were called out after a tonne of liquid helium leaked into the tunnel, which straddles the French-Swiss border. Helium spill: The machine has more than 1,200 \"dipole\" magnets arranged end-to-end in the 27km-long, ring-shaped tunnel that houses the LHC. These magnets carry and steer beams of protons which will whizz around the machine at close to the speed of light. At allotted points around the \"ring\", these beams cross paths, smashing together near four massive \"detectors\" that monitor the collisions for interesting events. Cern said the most likely cause of the equipment failure was a faulty electrical connection between two of the accelerator's magnets. This connection melted during testing of the machine and caused a huge leak of super-cool helium. This helium is used to chill the magnets to a temperature of 1.9 kelvin (-271C; -456F) - which is colder than deep space. This makes the magnets \"superconducting\", allowing them to generate the large magnetic fields required to steer the beams while at the same time consuming relatively little power. A quench occurs when part of a superconducting magnet heats up and causes superconducting properties to be lost. Hot spot: Cern has procedures in place to deal with quenches before they damage equipment, but in this instance a hot spot in the machine got out of control. \"It does seem that all the systems that are supposed to protect the machine in cases like this worked as far as we can tell. But obviously something went wrong,\" said Mr Gillies. \"The engineers have decided that in order to find out what really happened, they are going to have to go into the machine.\" One of the LHC's eight sectors will now have to be warmed up so an inspection can be carried out. Mr Gillies told BBC News that this was likely to take a week, and that engineers would then have a much better idea of how to fix the fault. Each particle accelerator is a unique machine, so Cern says that teething troubles were to be expected with such a complex machine at the cutting edge of technology. \"Events occur from time to time that temporarily stop operations, for shorter or longer periods, especially during the early phases,\" said Cern physicist Peter Limon.", "url": "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7632408.stm"}, {"title": "Why will it take so long to fix the Large Hadron Collider?", "date": "2008-09-29", "content": "After all the hooplah over firing up the Large Hadron Collider, the party turned out to be short-lived. On Sept. 20, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland announced that a large helium leak, likely due to a faulty electrical connection, would require at least a two-month delay for repairs. A week later, scientists said they would not restart the machine until next spring. This lengthy shutdown is necessary because scientists need to warm up the faulty area of the machine from its standard operating temperature of -456 degrees Fahrenheit-that's a few degrees colder than outer space and only three degrees above absolute zero, the temperature where all molecules stop moving.

This resulted in mechanical damage and release of helium from the magnet cold mass into the tunnel. Proper safety procedures were in force, the safety systems performed as expected, and no one was put at risk. Sufficient spare components are in hand to ensure that the LHC is able to restart in 2009, and measures to prevent a similar incident in the future are being put in place. \"This incident was unforeseen,\" said CERN Director General Robert Aymar, \"but I am now confident that we can make the necessary repairs, ensure that a similar incident can not happen in the future and move forward to achieving our research objectives.\" The summary report follows. Summary of the analysis of the 19 September 2008 incident at the LHC: On 19 September 2008, during powering tests of the main dipole circuit in Sector 3-4 of the LHC, a fault occurred in the electrical bus connection in the region between a dipole and a quadrupole, resulting in mechanical damage and release of helium from the magnet cold mass into the tunnel. Proper safety procedures were in force, the safety systems performed as expected, and no-one was put at risk. After a period during which the temperature of the magnets in question was allowed to rise close to room temperature, inspections started and a number of clear findings have now been established. Investigations are continuing and the complete findings will be reported at a later date. A - In the following summary, a brief description is given of the chain of events which occurred around mid-day on 19th September. A more detailed technical report is available here. 1. During the ramping-up of current in the main dipole circuit at the nominal rate of 10 A/s, a resistive zone developed leading in less than one second to a resistive voltage of 1 V at 9 kA. The power supply, unable to maintain the current ramp, tripped off and the energy discharge switch opened, inserting dump resistors into the circuit to produce a fast current decrease. In this sequence of events, the quench detection, power converter and energy discharge systems behaved as expected. Prior to this fast discharge, it is certain that a magnet quench can be excluded as the cause of the initial event. During the discharge, many magnet quenches were triggered automatically in the arc and the helium from their cold masses was recovered through the self actuated relief valves. 2. Within one second, an electrical arc developed, puncturing the helium enclosure and leading to a release of helium into the insulation vacuum of the cryostat. After 3 and 4 seconds, the beam vacuum also degraded in beam pipes 2 and 1, respectively. Then the insulation vacuum started to degrade in the two neighbouring subsectors. 3. The spring-loaded relief discs on the vacuum enclosure opened when the pressure exceeded atmospheric, thus releasing helium into the tunnel, but they were unable to contain the pressure rise below the nominal 0.15 MPa in the vacuum enclosure of the central subsector, thus resulting in large pressure forces acting on the vacuum barriers separating the central subsector from the neighbouring subsectors. B - After restoring power and services in the tunnel and ensuring mechanical stability of the magnets, the investigation teams proceeded to open up the cryostat sleeves in the interconnections between magnets, starting from the central subsector. This confirmed the location of the electrical arc, showed absence of electrical and mechanical damage in neighbouring interconnections, but revealed contamination by soot-like dust which propagated over some distance in the beam pipes. It also showed damage to the multilayer insulation blankets of the cryostats. The forces on the vacuum barriers attached to the quadrupoles at the subsector ends were such that the cryostats housing these quadrupoles broke their anchors in the concrete floor of the tunnel and were moved away from their original positions, with the electric and fluid connections pulling the dipole cold masses in the subsector from the cold internal supports inside their undisplaced cryostats. The displacement of the quadrupoles cryostats damaged \"jumper\" connections to the cryogenic distribution line, but without rupturing its insulation vacuum. C - Pending further inspection of the inside of the dipole cryostats, it has been established that the number of magnets to be repaired is at most 5 quadrupoles and 24 dipoles from the three subsectors involved. But it is possible that more magnets will have to be removed from the tunnel for cleaning and exchange of multilayer insulation. Spare magnets and spare components appear to be available in adequate types and sufficient quantities to allow replacement of the damaged ones during the forthcoming shutdown. The extent of contamination to the beam vacuum pipes is not yet fully mapped, but is known to be limited; in situ cleaning is being considered to keep the number of magnets to be removed to a minimum. The plan for removal/reinstallation, transport and repair of magnets in Sector 3-4 is being established and integrated with the maintenance and consolidation work to be performed during the winter shutdown across the whole CERN facility. The corresponding manpower resources have been secured. D - Once all possible inspections are completed, an analysis of the events will lead to recommendations for future actions to prevent the reoccurrence of this type of initial event, and to mitigate its consequences should it accidentally reoccur. Although the cause of the initial growth of connection resistance has not yet been established, and knowing that a similar event has not occurred in the test of all other sectors and of their thousands of connections, it has nonetheless been decided that additional measurements to generate early warnings and interlocks, improvements in pressure relief devices and in external anchoring of the quadrupole cryostats with vacuum barrier will be implemented before any further powering of the LHC circuits at high current.", "url": "https://press.cern/news/press-release/cern/cern-releases-analysis-lhc-incident"}, {"title": "The LHC is back", "date": "2008-11-20", "content": "Particle beams are once again circulating in the world's most powerful particle accelerator, CERN1's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This news comes after the machine was handed over for operation on Wednesday morning. A clockwise circulating beam was established at ten o'clock this evening. This is an important milestone on the road towards first physics at the LHC, expected in 2010. \"It's great to see beam circulating in the LHC again,\" said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. \"We've still got some way to go before physics can begin, but with this milestone we're well on the way.\" The LHC circulated its first beams on 10 September 2008, but suffered a serious malfunction nine days later. A failure in an electrical connection led to serious damage, and CERN has spent over a year repairing and consolidating the machine to ensure that such an incident cannot happen again. \"The LHC is a far better understood machine than it was a year ago,\" said CERN's Director for Accelerators, Steve Myers. \"We've learned from our experience, and engineered the technology that allows us to move on. That's how progress is made.\" Recommissioning the LHC began in the summer, and successive milestones have regularly been passed since then. The LHC reached its operating temperature of 1.9 Kelvin, or about -271 Celsius, on 8 October. Particles were injected on 23 October, but not circulated. A beam was steered through three octants of the machine on 7 November, and circulating beams have now been re-established. The next important milestone will be low-energy collisions, expected in about a week from now. These will give the experimental collaborations their first collision data, enabling important calibration work to be carried out. This is significant, since up to now, all the data they have recorded comes from cosmic rays. Ramping the beams to high energy will follow in preparation for collisions at 7 TeV (3.5 TeV per beam) next year. Particle physics is a global endeavour, and CERN has received support from around the world in getting the LHC up and running again. \"It's been a herculean effort to get to where we are today,\" said Myers. \"I'd like to thank all those who have taken part, from CERN and from our partner institutions around the world.\"", "url": "https://press.cern/news/press-release/cern/lhc-back"}, {"title": "Two circulating beams bring first collisions in the LHC", "date": "2008-11-23", "content": "Today the LHC circulated two beams simultaneously for the first time, allowing the operators to test the synchronization of the beams and giving the experiments their first chance to look for proton-proton collisions. With just one bunch of particles circulating in each direction, the beams can be made to cross in up to two places in the ring. From early in the afternoon, the beams were made to cross at points 1 and 5, home to the ATLAS and CMS detectors, both of which were on the look out for collisions. Later, beams crossed at points 2 and 8, ALICE and LHCb. \"It's a great achievement to have come this far in so short a time,\" said CERN1Director General Rolf Heuer. \"But we need to keep a sense of perspective - there's still much to do before we can start the LHC physics programme.\" Beams were first tuned to produce collisions in the ATLAS detector, which recorded its first candidate for collisions at 14:22 this afternoon. Later, the beams were optimised for CMS. In the evening, ALICE had the first optimization, followed by LHCb. \"This is great news, the start of a fantastic era of physics and hopefully discoveries after 20 years' work by the international community to build a machine and detectors of unprecedented complexity and performance,\" said ATLAS spokesperson, Fabiola Gianotti. \"The events so far mark the start of the second half of this incredible voyage of discovery of the secrets of nature,\" said CMS spokesperson Tejinder Virdee. \"It was standing room only in the ALICE control room and cheers erupted with the first collisions\" said ALICE spokesperson Jurgen Schukraft. \"This is simply tremendous.\" \"The tracks we're seeing are beautiful,\" said LHCb spokesperson Andrei Golutvin, \"we're all ready for serious data taking in a few days time.\" These developments come just three days after the LHC restart, demonstrating the excellent performance of the beam control system. Since the start-up, the operators have been circulating beams around the ring alternately in one direction and then the other at the injection energy of 450 GeV. The beam lifetime has gradually been increased to 10 hours, and today beams have been circulating simultaneously in both directions, still at the injection energy. Next on the schedule is an intense commissioning phase aimed at increasing the beam intensity and accelerating the beams. All being well, by Christmas, the LHC should reach 1.2 TeV per beam, and have provided good quantities of collision data for the experiments' calibrations.", "url": "https://press.cern/news/press-release/cern/two-circulating-beams-bring-first-collisions-lhc"}, {"title": "LHC to restart in 2009", "date": "2008-12-05", "content": "CERN today confirmed that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will restart in 2009.

This resulted in mechanical damage and release of helium from the magnet cold mass into the tunnel. Proper safety procedures were in force, the safety systems performed as expected, and no one was put at risk. Detailed studies of the malfunction have allowed the LHC's engineers to identify means of preventing a similar incident from reoccurring in the future, and to design new protection systems for the machine. A total of 53 magnet units have to be removed from the tunnel for cleaning or repair, of these, 28 have already been brought to the surface and the first two replacement units have been installed in the tunnel. The current schedule foresees the final magnet being reinstalled by the end of March 2009, with the LHC being cold and ready for powering tests by the end of June 2009. \"We have a lot of work to do over the coming months,\" said LHC project Leader Lyn Evans, \"but we now have the roadmap, the time and the competence necessary to be ready for physics by summer.

Parts of it have had to be warmed up for repairs, but CERN officials said that they hope to have the entire ring cold by the end of June, and that collisions perhaps as high as 5 trillion electron volts could begin in August. Collisions at higher levels will not be possible by then because the magnets have not been \"trained' to the levels necessary for 7-trillion-electron-volt operation. This, CERN admits, is an \"aggressive schedule\" in the words of spokesman James Gillies. The collider had just begun to fire up its beams of protons (but had not actually begun to collide them), when, on Sept. 19, an electrical bus connecting two magnets developed a spot of resistance, began to heat up under the load of 9,300 amperes and vaporized. Engineers reconstructing the mishap believe a spark punctured the blanket of super-cooled helium, which surrounds the magnets, and which itself is surrounded by a vacuum insulating layer. The helium flooded into the surrounding vacuum faster than relief valves could spray it into the main collider tunnel. The resulting internal pressures shoved some of the magnets, which weigh 10 tons, off their mounts and crunched the connections between them. The beam pipes that the protons shoot through were also punctured and contaminated with soot. Or as Dr. Gillies said, \"It's a mess.\" The incident happened in the last of eight sectors of the ring to undergo the testing needed to qualify for high-energy running and just two months before CERN would have shut down the collider for the winter, in order to save money on electricity. So the lab chose not to try to rush the machine back into operation this fall. Not that they could have. To fix it all, 53 of the superconducting magnets will have to be brought out of the collider, which is 300 feet underground, to the surface for inspection and repair, a process that has already begun. Once they have all been fixed or replaced, the sector of the ring they occupy will have to be cooled all the way back down to near absolute zero again and tested. In addition, the CERN engineers have performed diagnostic tests and found two other spots around the ring with suspicious resistance readings similar to what preceded September's failure. Both are in sectors that had already been qualified for 5 trillion-electron-volt operations without incident. One of them is in a sector adjacent to the damaged sector and has been warmed up. Dr. Gillies said engineers would look at it this winter. The other is in a part of the ring that is still cold and there is no plan to warm it up, he said. CERN flirted briefly with the idea of warming up the entire ring this winter, in which case the colllider would not have operated at all in 2009. \"Everything was on the table,\" Dr. Gillies admitted. But, he said, \"The priority is to get data for the experiments.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/science/06cern.html"}, {"title": "The damage that derailed the Large Hadron Collider", "date": "2008-12-11", "content": "The world's most powerful particle accelerator switched on in September, causing great excitement, but just nine days later a helium leak shut the LHC down.

The lab will take the unusual step of running its brand new \u20ac3 billion machine throughout the winter - with a short break around Christmas \"to allow people not to get divorced!\" says CERN's director for research and computing, Sergio Bertolucci. With winter energy prices, that will add about \u20ac8 million to the LHC's electricity bill - about 40% of its annual cost. But physicists on the LHC's four giant experiments will reap the rewards by late 2010, when they should have collected enough data at a collision energy of 10 TeV to rival the Tevatron at Fermilab, perhaps seeing signs of new fundamental particles. The latest startup schedule is eerily similar to last year's, when the LHC fired up on 10 September. Just nine days later, an electrical fault ruptured its liquid-helium plumbing, putting the machine out of commission. CERN is now installing an early-warning system to detect nano-ohm rises in resistance in the superconducting wires that power the LHC's bending magnets. It is also fitting all magnets with additional pressure relief valves to reduce collateral damage in case of a similar incident. Half of the valves will be in place this year. The startup date is likely to please thousands of physicists who have had to deal with several slips in the LHC timetable in the last few years. \"The schedule is aggressive,\" says CERN's director of accelerators and technology Steve Myers, \"but we have a machine that's just raring to go.\"", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16567-large-hadron-collider-to-restart-in-september/"}, {"title": "Safety precautions delay start-up of hadron collider", "date": "2009-02-18", "content": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's most powerful particle accelerator, will see no collisions until late October, more than a year after its planned start date.

But on 9 February CERN announced a further delay, citing additional safety protocols and complex repair schedules as the reasons. With a short technical stop over Christmas, the LHC will run through to autumn 2010, but it will accelerate its protons to just 5 teraelectronvolts (TeV), well below its designed 7 TeV.

The European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) flagship particle accelerator has been out of action since September, when an electrical fault called a halt to an experiment to understand the fundamental physics of matter. It is scheduled to restart in September 2009. On Wednesday, James Gillies, head of communications at CERN, said the LHC could carry on running over the subsequent months. Normally, CERN particle-acceleration operations cease in November for the winter, because energy costs throughout the winter months are prohibitively high. \"The schedule is fairly tight,\" Gillies told ZDNet UK. \"Instead of shutting down for the winter, this year, we will start up in September, October, or later, and run continually until we have enough data in the can. We will run straight through the winter if necessary.\" CERN is able to cover the energy cost of running the LHC during outside its schedule because it had had less expenditure while the experiment was halted, Gilles said. \"We're getting the money from the standard CERN budget,\" he said. \"If we hadn't had the incident last year, we would be running the LHC.\" Gillies added that CERN would continue to be supplied by EDF on the French side and EOS on the Swiss side, and that EOS would provide energy through the cold season. The energy demands of the LHC are high. The particle beams are designed to run at a maximum of 7 TeV, and have run at around 5 TeV. There is 350MJ stored in each beam, which CERN scientists estimate has enough energy to drill a 30m hole in copper. The LHC experiment, designed to smash beams of nuclear particles into each other, was brought to a halt nine days after it was started. A fault in a copper bus-bar caused a resistive zone, which then prevented the normal operation of a quench. This caused an electrical arc, which punctured the cavity containing liquid helium used to supercool both the experiment and the magnets which direct and focus the particle beams. The fault was the result of an insufficiently welded joint between two of the bus-bars, which are used to carry the superconducting cable. CERN beams department scientist Jorg Wenninger said in a presentation (PDF) on Monday that all the approximately 1,700 joints had been inspected. Many were found to have bad soldering or reduced electrical contact, the same problem that caused the initial incident. A new quench-monitoring and protection system has been implemented that will give an early warning if any part of the superconducting coils or bus-bars develops high resistance, Gilles noted.

The collider, which lies underground near the Franco-Swiss border, was shut down after nine days of operation on Sept. 19, 2008, after the meltdown of a small electrical connection between two of the accelerator's magnets caused the release of a large amount of liquid helium into the 27-km-long tunnel that houses the accelerator. The collider is designed to push protons using a ring of super-cooled magnets to speeds and energies never before reached under controlled conditions, and crash them into one another to create and detect a host of new particles.

But even at this level, the Large Hadron Collider has the potential to uncover exotic new physics, such as signs of hidden extra dimensions, physicists say. The LHC is a new particle accelerator at the CERN laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, designed to answer fundamental questions, such as what gives elementary particles their mass, by colliding particles at higher energies than ever achieved in a laboratory before. But the first attempt to turn on the LHC failed in September 2008 when a joint connecting a pair of superconducting wires overheated, causing an explosive release of helium used as a coolant. Scientists have been making repairs and checking the strength of other electrical connections since then to pave the way for a second start attempt. Now, CERN has announced that the LHC's first data collecting run, to begin in November, will collide protons at only half the energy the accelerator was designed to achieve. The run will initially smash protons together at 7 trillion electron volts (7 TeV), compared to the design goal of 14 TeV, according to a CERN statement on 6 August. (Protons in each of the two opposing beams will have 3.5 TeV of energy, producing collisions at 7 TeV.) Measurements indicate that some of the electrical connections could not safely handle the amount of current needed to run at the full 14 TeV, so will need to be replaced before dialling up the energy that far. But even 7 TeV is much higher than physicists have ever probed in the laboratory before. The Tevatron accelerator at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, is the current record holder, with collisions at 2 TeV.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17566-large-hadron-collider-to-restart-at-half-its-designed-energy/"}, {"title": "LHC now colder than deep space", "date": "2009-10-20", "content": "The LHC (Large Hadron Collider) is once again colder than deep space as it is prepared for experiments to resume in late November. The LHC's eight sectors have all been cooled to 1.9 kelvin (-271 C, or -456 F) using cryogenic lines containing liquid helium. This operating temperature is colder than conditions in deep space, which is estimated to be 2.7 K. Zero K is the lowest temperature possible. The magnets that bend particle beams around the LHC need to be this cold because at these low temperatures they become superconductors, channeling electric current with almost no power loss, and with zero resistance. In the LHC experiments, two beams of protons will be fired in opposite directions through the ring between the magnets. They will reach close to the speed of light, and smash into one another at four collision points. The collisions are predicted to produce thousands of particles, which will be studied by the scientists, The results are expected to shed new light on the nature of the universe and its beginnings. A magnet problem dubbed a \"quench\" in September 2008 resulted in the LHC particle accelerator being shut down after a tonne of liquid helium leaked into the LHC tunnel. The facility had to be warmed up to allow for the approximately $40 million in repairs to be carried out. Now the LHC ring is cooled again magnet powering tests can be carried out. In the commissioning process the magnets are powered with gradually increasing current until the operating current of 6 kA is reached. This current is needed to guide the particle beams, which will travel at a nominal energy of 3.5 TeV. CERN will also carry out thorough tests of components of the new quench protection system before the particle collision experiments can begin. The system comprises hundreds of new detectors designed to detect any splice malfunctions at a sufficiently early stage for the machine to be protected. The new system should prevent further incidents like the one that shut down the LHC last year. A low intensity beam test involving parts of the collider could be carried out before November, while particle collision experiments with low intensity beams are expected in late November. If these are successful, the energy of the beams will be increased, with high energy collisions scheduled for December or January. Director of communications with CERN, James Gillies said the high-energy collisions would require delicate operation of the accelerator. He likened the relative distances in the operation to firing knitting needles across the Atlantic and making them smash into each other half way across. The LHC is the most powerful particle accelerator ever built. Its magnets are lined end to end in a circular tunnel 27 km in circumference, buried 50 to 175 meters underground beneath the border between Switzerland and France.

The four largest detectors at the LHC all recorded candidate collision events. Scientists at CERN, throughout the United States, and around the world celebrated the news. \"This is a very exciting moment after so many years of preparation,\" said Andrew Lankford from the University of California, Irvine, deputy spokesperson for the ATLAS experiment. Beams were first tuned to produce collisions in the ATLAS detector, which recorded its first candidate for collisions at 2:22 p.m. local time. \"The real accomplishment belongs to the accelerator scientists for bringing the beams into collision so quickly after they were first circulated,\" he added. These first collisions are another milestone on the way to the ultimate goal: high-energy collisions of protons in the center of the LHC experiments. They follow a weekend of rapid progress for the LHC. After more than one year of repairs, on Friday evening, November 20, beams were once again circulating in the collider. Over the weekend, the LHC team carefully studied the beams one at a time. Today at approximately 1:30 local time, two beams circulated at the same time for the first time in the LHC. As the two circulating beams passed through each other, protons from each beam hit one another, and the resulting spray of particles registered in the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb detectors. \"It's a great achievement to have come this far in so short a time,\" said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer in a statement issued by the laboratory. \"But we need to keep a sense of perspective - there's still much to do before we can start the LHC physics programme.\" These particular collisions happened against the odds. When the LHC is fully operational, each beam will consist of almost 3000 bunches of more than one hundred billion protons each. Despite the enormous number of protons, each bunch will still contain mostly empty space, and operators will \"squeeze\" them to increase the chances of two protons colliding. Today, during the testing phase of the accelerator, each beam only contained one bunch of several billion protons, and the beams were not squeezed. Thus the chance of two protons colliding as the bunches passed through each other was very small, and resulted in relatively few recorded collisions in each experiment. \"This is another great technical achievement for the LHC accelerator team and allows the collaborations on the LHC experiments to make further progress in preparing for first high-energy collision data,\" said Bob Cousins from the University of California, Los Angeles, deputy spokesperson for the CMS experiment. \"We are getting a chance to test drive our detectors with real collision data.\" More than 1700 scientists, engineers, students, and technicians from 97 US universities and national laboratories have helped design and build the LHC accelerator and its four massive particle detectors, known by their acronyms: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. They are joined by an estimated 8500 colleagues from 59 countries around the world. US participation from institutions in 32 states and Puerto Rico is supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Science and the National Science Foundation. \"Everyone's very excited,\" said Tom LeCompte from the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory, the physics coordinator for the ATLAS experiment. \"We will use these very first collisions to determine if our detector is 'in time,' by which I mean that when a collision occurs, every part of the detector sees it happening at exactly the same time.\" Precise timing is critical for these huge detectors, where millions of separate detector elements, some separated from each other by tens of meters, must be synchronized to within one billionth of a second. The first collisions will also be used by scientists to calibrate and test many other parts of the complex detectors. The first two protons collided at the relatively low energies with which they were injected into the LHC, 450 GeV each. Over the next few months, LHC scientists will raise the beam energy, aiming for collisions at the world-record energy of 3.5 TeV per beam in early 2010. With these high-energy collisions, the teams on the LHC experiments will embark on their quest to solve some of the mysteries of the universe. American scientists have contributed critical components to the construction of the LHC accelerator and experiments, continue to play key roles in the operation of the detectors, and will be vital to the success of the experiments in their search for new phenomena such as the Higgs boson and the particles that make up dark matter.", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2009/11/23/first-particles-collide-in-the-large-hadron-collider"}, {"title": "LHC smashes protons together for first time", "date": "2009-11-23", "content": "The Large Hadron Collider bashed protons together for the first time on Monday, inaugurating a new era in the quest to uncover nature's deepest secrets.

At 12.44am this morning, the LHC accelerated beams of subatomic particles to higher energies than any achieved before in a collider. The machine, which occupies a 27km circular tunnel that straddles the French-Swiss border, was restarted 10 days ago after being shut down for more than a year while engineers repaired damage caused by a helium leak when it was first switched on in September last year. \"The machine is working like a dream,\" Lyn Evans, project manager of the LHC, told the Guardian. \"It's brilliant. By the end of the week we should be really moving.\" Inside the particle accelerator, two counter-rotating beams of hydrogen nuclei are whipped up to more than 99.99% the speed of light. At four points around the machine the beams are crossed, steering the particles into high-energy smash-ups. The collisions recreate in microcosm the conditions that existed moments after the big bang. According to Einstein's famous equation E = mc2, the energy released by the collisions can create matter in the form of particles that appear in the collider's detectors. Scientists hope that when they sift through the subatomic debris they will find particles that are new to physics, such as the Higgs boson, which gives mass to elementary particles, and possibly particles of dark matter, an elusive substance that clusters around galaxies and accounts for most of the mass in the universe. At 9.48pm last night, engineers at Cern accelerated one beam of particles to 1.05 trillion electronvolts. Three hours later, both beams were hurtling around the machine, each with an energy of 1.18 trillion electronvolts. The energies are greater than any achieved at what is now the second most powerful collider in the world, the Tevatron at Fermilab on the outskirts of Chicago. \"For me, it's not so much the energy record that matters, it's that we've got through the start of the acceleration process where things are changing rapidly,\" Evans said. As the beams are accelerated, eddy currents build up in the enormous superconducting magnets inside the machine and produce erratic magnetic fields that affect how the beams behave. In the next few days, Cern managers will decide whether to start colliding particles at even greater energy, or run for a short time at lower energies. Scientists will use the first collisions to calibrate their detectors, ensuring they pick up any particles that might be produced under the known laws of physics. \"We're about to move into a new energy regime, and when we do that, we can start to see new things,\" Evans said. \"We are still coming to terms with just how smoothly the LHC commissioning is going. It is fantastic,\" said Rolf Heuer, Cern's director general. \"We are continuing to take it step by step, and there is still a lot to do before we start physics in 2010. I'm keeping my champagne on ice until then.\" Over the next week, engineers will increase the beam intensity to a level that is expected, before Christmas, to reveal new physics at work. The first extended series of high-energy collisions is expected to start in January or February next year, when each beam will be accelerated to 3.5 trillion electronvolts. \"I was here 20 years ago when we switched on Cern's last major particle accelerator, LEP,\" said Steve Myers, Cern's director of accelerators and technology, referring to the Large Electron Positron collider, which smashed electrons into their antimatter counterparts, positrons. \"I thought that was a great machine to operate, but this is something else.

There was a special Cern seminar yesterday evening on some new results from the CMS experiment, one of the detectors at the Large Hadron Collider. The result is summarised in this colourful landscape. First imagine this is a contour map of the cylinder CMS makes around the LHC collisions. It has been cut lengthwise and unrolled. Then for each pair of particles in an event, you put one of them at (0,0), and plot the position of the other. (Thanks to GreyBadger for the comment below correcting the initial over-simplified explanation here). The map is the average distribution of the separation between particle pairs for a very special class of events, with very many particles in them. The big peak is something like a \"jet\" of particles, what we expect when a quark or gluon in the proton undergoes a collision and is scattered off at an angle. Balancing it on the other side is a long ridge. This is an expected feature. You have to have something there to balance energy and momentum. The weird thing is the other ridge (pointed at by the arrow). This shows particles and energy coming out far away from the jet in rapidity (meaning at angles along the LHC beam) but on the same side of it around the cylinder. Our best models of quark and gluon interactions and jet production do not predict such an effect. What is causing it? Well, a similar effect was seen at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the US. There it was interpreted as the quarks and gluons in a collision between heavy nuclei behaving collectively - moving together like a drop of liquid or a plasma. This is the way quarks and gluons behave under extreme temperature and pressure - for instance shortly after the Big Bang. The big surprise is seeing these in proton-proton collisions. As far as I know, it was thought that the temperature, pressure and the sheer number of quarks and gluons would not be enough to cause this. This is why RHIC uses heavy nuclei, not just protons. The LHC will run with heavy ions at some point soon. (In fact the Alice detector is built specifically for this). My guess is that the CMS scientists were making this measurement with protons as a baseline test for future heavy ion measurements. I suspect they are as surprised as anyone else to see that ridge. I expect a lot of theoretical activity over the next weeks and months as people try to digest and interpret these results.

Each lead nucleus contains 82 protons, and the LHC accelerates each proton to an energy of 3.5 TeV, thus resulting in an energy of 287 TeV per beam, or a total collision energy of 574 TeV.

Last week we walked you through the process of creating, accelerating and colliding lead ions. Now we'll talk about the big question: Why spend one month each year colliding heavy ions in the LHC? The building blocks and mini 'big bangs': To understand why physicists around the world study heavy-ion collisions, we need to review some basic particle physics and discuss what happens when two nuclei collide at ultra-high energies. First, the basics. Everything you see around you is composed of atoms, which are themselves composed of protons and neutrons bound together in an atomic nucleus, surrounded by a cloud of electrons. Electrons are one of the basic building blocks of matter, but protons and neutrons are not-they are in turn composed of elementary particles called quarks. The strong force binds quarks inside composite particles, such as protons, via other elementary particles called gluons. Thus lead nuclei, which are made up of protons and neutrons, are really composed of many quarks and gluons. When two lead nuclei slam into each other at high enough energies, they form a fireball of hot, dense matter. The temperatures created in the fireball are so great that they 'melt' the protons and neutrons. The result is a state of matter called the quark gluon plasma, in which quarks and gluons roam freely. The QGP exists for only an instant before the fireball expands and cools to the point where quarks and gluons once again form composite particles. The LHC is not the first accelerator to create QGP. CERN announced indirect evidence for the \"new state of matter\" in 2000, a result of experiments in the 1980s and 1990s at the Super Proton Synchrotron (now used as the injector for the LHC). Next up was Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In 2005 scientists from the RHIC experiments tentatively claimed the creation of a QGP in collisions of gold nuclei. Physicists at the LHC are now studying collisions of lead nuclei-and the properties of the QGP that should be produced in those collisions-at energies more than 13 times higher than at RHIC.", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2010/11/12/lhc-basics-what-we-can-learn-from-lead-ion-collisions"}, {"title": "Early universe recreated in LHC was superhot liquid", "date": "2010-11-25", "content": "The early universe was an extremely dense and superhot liquid, according to the surprise first findings of the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland.

The idea behind ALICE is to recreate the exotic, primordial \"soup of particles\" known as quark-gluon plasma that appeared microseconds after the universe's birth. Gluons and quarks went on to become the constitutive \"bricks\" of neutrons and protons inside atomic nuclei. Many models have suggested that the flow of particles from these subatomic fireworks produced in high-energy nuclear collisions should behave like a gas and not a liquid. \"These observations keep surprising us,\" says David Evans of the University of Birmingham, UK, a member of the ALICE team. A further surprise was the density of subatomic particles created by the smash.

During this time, the Universe would have been so hot and energetic that the particles making up the elements we know today were unable to form, leaving the constituents to float \"free\" as a primordial soup. Quarks and gluons were only able to condense into larger particles when universal energy conditions were low enough. Hadrons (i.e. particles made from quarks; including baryons like neutrons and protons) were only allowed to form 10^-6 seconds after the Big Bang.

Now, a pair of papers appearing in Physical Review Letters, from the ALICE and ATLAS experiments at the LHC, presents a first glimpse of what new information these high-energy collisions will offer about the quark-gluon plasma-the state of matter believed to have filled the universe at the time of the Big Bang. The ALICE results strongly indicate that the quark-gluon plasma remains a nearly ideal liquid, as seen earlier at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), even at significantly higher energies.

String theory is the most widely accepted attempt to unify the two major fields of physics, quantum mechanics and relativity. It holds that electrons and quarks are not objects, but one-dimensional strings whose oscillation gives them their observed qualities. It also says the universe has about a dozen dimensions, rather than the usual four (length, width, height and time). In one version of string theory, if these dimensions exist, gravitons - hypothetical particles that transmit gravity - would leak into them, explaining why gravity is so much weaker than the other forces, as New Scientist explains it.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN physics lab in Geneva, Switzerland, has been operating since 2009, slowly ramping up its power levels and the intensity of its particle beams. Beam intensity is measured in luminosity, which corresponds to how many particles - in this case protons - are packed into each beam. The more protons that are accelerated along LHC's 17-mile long (27-km) loop, the greater the chances that two protons will smack into each other head on. These collisions are what the atom smasher was created for. In their energetic aftermath, exotic particles, some of which have never been seen before, can be produced and measured. \"Beam intensity is key to the success of the LHC, so this is a very important step,\" CERN director general Rolf Heuer said in a statement. \"Higher intensity means more data, and more data means greater discovery potential.\" The LHC set the new beam intensity world record around midnight Geneva time on April 22. It reached a luminosity of 4.67 x 1032 cm-2s-1, greater than the previous world record of 4.024 x 1032cm-2s-1, which was set by the world's second-largest atom smasher, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory's Tevatron collider in Batavia, Ill., in 2010. Scientists want to create as many collisions as possible, because some of the particles they're looking for are extremely rare, and will only pop up once in a while. One example is the fabled Higgs boson particle, thought to imbue other particles with mass. This one has been theorized, but never detected. If it exists, it will be created in the LHC only occasionally.

Squeezing more protons into increasingly smaller spaces boosts the luminosity, which gives protons a better chance of colliding. Adding up the luminosity over a long period of time - say, a year - provides the integrated luminosity, which is related to the total number of collisions seen by the detectors. Last year's integrated luminosity of 49 inverse picobarns corresponds to several thousand billion collisions at the LHC. The record peak luminosity means more collisions and, in turn, a much higher integrated luminosity. Scientists aim to collect anywhere between 1000 and 3000 inverse picobarns by the end of 2011.

This week at Quark Matter 2011, scientists from LHC are sharing the results of their experiments, which have elevated studies of the QGP to a whole new energy level. Their observations of how particles react to the plasma have given them new hints as to its temperature and the strength of its influence. \"It's a very exciting time,\" said Brookhaven National Laboratory physicist Peter Steinberg of the ATLAS collaboration. \"Now that we've all shown our hands, we're going to start comparing results.\" Scientists from the CMS experiment gained new insights from the studies of particles called upsilons. An upsilon is a bound state of a bottom quark and its antiparticle. Upsilons come in three basic bound states, each almost identical to the next except for the strength of the bond between its quarks. During most of the year, scientists at the LHC collide protons in their detectors. But for one month, they take a break from the usual fare to collide heavy ions. Heavy ion collisions have the ability to create quark gluon plasma. Scientists on the CMS experiment at the LHC compared the production of the three states of upsilons in both types of collisions. Heavy-ion collisions seemed to produce a smaller fraction of lightly bound upsilons than proton-proton collisions. This could be because the less tightly bound upsilons break up in the heat of the quark gluon plasma, but not the most tightly bound ones. The fact that only some types of upsilons melt apart in the QGP gives scientists a great tool for divining the temperature of the plasma. They can calculate the energies at which the different states would break apart. They know from experiment that the QGP is hotter than the breaking points of the weakest two states but cooler than that of the strongest one. \"Temperature is one of the most fundamental parameters,\" said MIT scientist Bolek Wyslouch of the CMS collaboration. \"Once you know that, you can look at other things.\" Scientists on the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS experiments have studied the interactions of other particles with the QGP. J/psi particles also seem to break up in the quark gluon plasma, but they only come in one easily measurable bound state. Photons and Z bosons do not interact strongly and so seem unaffected by the quark gluon plasma. Another phenomenon scientists are using to reveal the secrets of the quark gluon plasma is jet quenching. Particle collisions often produce sprays of particles that fly away from the interaction point in opposite directions. Scientists looked that these back-to-back jets created in the quark gluon plasma and found that many of them were imbalanced. The jets on the side with a greater density of the plasma shrank significantly before shooting out the other side, apparently sapped of their energy by the QGP. Scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory previously studied jet quenching at the RHIC accelerator. This year, the ATLAS and CMS experiments were able to study jets in finer detail. This is because the particles in jets created in LHC collisions have greater energy and because the detectors at LHC experiments cover more area around the collision point than those at RHIC. The ALICE experiment will be able to do the same later this year, now that its new calorimeter is in place. \"LHC experiments have taken a giant step toward understanding the properties of the quark gluon plasma,\" said Yale physicist John Harris of the ALICE experiment. \"To me that just jumped out at the conference.

Here symmetry breaking examines what it really takes to put lead beams in the LHC. The source: Making heavy ions is more complicated than preparing the protons used in regular LHC collisions, which come from hydrogen gas. Since hydrogen atoms have only one proton and one electron each, applying a voltage to them is sufficient to rip off their electrons, leaving a load of beam-ready, positively charged protons. But the source for heavy ions, enriched lead, starts with 82 electrons. Physicists do not have miracle flypaper to grab that many subatomic particles at once, so the process takes a few steps. Meet Detlef Kuchler, a heavy-ion expert who tends the lead source, the first part of the heavy-ion acceleration process, by hand. He helped develop the method of extracting lead ions decades ago and can explain from memory its hundreds of associated, unlabeled diagrams.

To the best of our knowledge, the universe began with equal, or nearly equal, amounts of matter and antimatter. Because these particles annihilate on contact, they should have destroyed each other long ago in a blaze of radiation, leaving little if anything behind to form stars, planets and people. Clearly, that didn't happen. The hunt for the special something that might have skewed the universe in favour of matter occupies the best minds in physics. Compelling signs of such lopsided physics have emerged at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva in Switzerland. It is the first sign of new physics at the LHC and could provide a boost for the theory of supersymmetry, which adds a zoo of new particles to the ones we already know. \"We are getting excited,\" says Yuval Grossman of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Curiously, the finding does not come from either of the LHC's two main detectors, ATLAS and CMS, which collectively keep 5000 researchers hard at work. Instead, it springs from the relatively small group of 600 working on another device called LHCb. \"It gives LHCb bragging rights,\" says Ikaros Bigi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. The standard model, our best theory for how particles and forces interact, allows for only tiny differences in the behaviour of matter and antimatter. For example, an unstable particle of matter is expected to decay into daughter particles at nearly the same rate as its antimatter cousin. Now LHCb has turned up surprisingly large differences in these decay rates. It measured the decays of short-lived particles called mesons, which are pairs of quarks. In particular, it studied the decays of a type of meson called D0 and its antimatter counterpart, the anti-D0. Each can decay into a pair of lighter mesons, making a pion plus an anti-pion or a kaon plus an anti-kaon. If the standard model is right, it should not matter whether the starting particle is a D0 or an anti-D0. The probability of obtaining a pion plus anti-pion pair should be virtually the same in either case, as should the probability of obtaining a kaon plus anti-kaon pair. To see whether the two behave identically, the experimenters subtracted the number of pion plus anti-pion pairs produced by the D0 particles from those produced by the anti-D0 particles. They did a similar subtraction for the pairs of kaons and anti-kaons. Then, to cancel out experimental biases, they subtracted each of these results from the other. If the decay rates were the same, that difference would be a big fat zero.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228404-200-lhc-antimatter-anomaly-hints-at-new-physics/"}, {"title": "LHC sees hint of lightweight Higgs boson", "date": "2011-12-13", "content": "The ultra-shy Higgs boson may have finally shown itself at the LHC.

Such a featherweight would need at least one new type of particle to stabilise it. \"It's very exciting,\" says CMS spokesman Guido Tonelli. \"This could be the first ring in a chain of discoveries.\" As the leading theory for how particles and forces interact, the standard model has been spectacularly successful since it was proposed in the 1960s.

The problem is known as pile-up, and it promises to be one of the greatest challenges this year for scientists working on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Europe's main high-energy physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. Huge amounts of computing power, cunning software and technical tricks are helping scientists to stay ahead of the problem. But researchers may still need to scale back the collisions to find the long-sought Higgs, the manifestation of a field that is believed to confer mass on other particles. If it exists, the Higgs will appear fleetingly inside the machine before decaying into lighter particles. Last year, the two biggest detectors at the LHC saw hints of a Higgs with a mass of about 125 gigaelectronvolts (energy and mass are interchangeable in particle physics). This year, researchers want to collect more data to see whether that signal grows into a certainty, or withers back to nothing.

Experiments using heavy ions at CERN1's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are advancing understanding of the primordial universe. The ALICE, ATLAS and CMS collaborations have made new measurements of the kind of matter that probably existed in the first instants of the universe. They will present their latest results at the Quark Matter 2012 conference, which starts today in Washington DC. The new findings are based mainly on the four-week LHC run with lead ions in 2011, during which the experiments collected 20 times more data than in 2010. Just after the big bang, quarks and gluons - basic building blocks of matter - were not confined inside composite particles such as protons and neutrons, as they are today. Instead, they moved freely in a state of matter known as \"quark-gluon plasma\". Collisions of lead ions in the LHC, the world's most powerful particle accelerator, recreate for a fleeting moment conditions similar to those of the early universe. By examining a billion or so of these collisions, the experiments have been able to make more precise measurements of the properties of matter under these extreme conditions. \"The field of heavy-ion physics is crucial for probing the properties of matter in the primordial universe, one of the key questions of fundamental physics that the LHC and its experiments are designed to address. It illustrates how in addition to the investigation of the recently discovered Higgs-like boson, physicists at the LHC are studying many other important phenomena in both proton-proton and lead-lead collisions,\" said CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer. At the conference, the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS collaborations will present more refined characterizations of the densest and hottest matter ever studied in the laboratory - 100,000 times hotter than the interior of the Sun and denser than a neutron star. ALICE will present a wealth of new results on all aspects of the evolution of high-density, strongly interacting matter in both space and time. Important studies deal with \"charmed particles\", which contain a charm or anticharm quark. Charm quarks, 100 times heavier than the up and down quarks that form normal matter, are significantly decelerated by their passage through quark-gluon plasma, offering scientists a unique tool to probe its properties. ALICE physicists will report indications that the flow in the plasma is so strong that the heavy charmed particles are dragged along by it. The experiment has also observed indications of a thermalization phenomenon, which involves the recombination of charm and anticharm quarks to form \"charmonium\". \"This is only one leading example of the scientific opportunities in reach of the ALICE experiment,\" said Paolo Giubellino, spokesperson of the ALICE collaboration. \"With more data still being analysed and further data-taking scheduled for next February, we are closer than ever to unravelling the properties of the primordial state of the universe: the quark-gluon plasma.\" In the 1980s, the initial dissociation of charmonium was proposed as a direct signature for the formation of quark-gluon plasma, and first experimental indications of this dissociation were reported from fixed-target experiments at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron in 2000. The much higher energy of the LHC makes it possible for the first time to study similar tightly-bound states of the heavier beauty quarks. The hypothesis was that, depending on their binding energy, some of these states would \"melt\" in the plasma produced, while others would survive the extreme temperature. The CMS experiment now observes clear signs of the expected sequential suppression of the \"quarkonium\" (quark-antiquark) states. \"CMS will present important new heavy-ion results not only on quarkonium suppression, but also on bulk properties of the medium and on a variety of studies of jet quenching,\" said CMS spokesperson Joseph Incandela. \"We are entering an exciting new era of high-precision research on strongly interacting matter at the highest energies produced in the laboratory.\" The quenching of jets is the phenomenon in which highly energetic sprays of particles break up in the dense quark-gluon plasma, giving scientists detailed information about the density and properties of the produced matter. ATLAS will report new findings on jet quenching, including a high-precision study of how the jets fragment in matter, and on the correlations between jets and electroweak bosons. The results are complementary to other exciting ones, including groundbreaking findings on the flow of the plasma. \"We have entered a new phase in which we not only observe the phenomenon of quark-gluon plasma, but where we can also make high-precision measurements using a variety of probes,\" said ATLAS spokesperson Fabiola Gianotti. \"The studies will contribute significantly to our understanding of the early universe.\" ", "url": "https://home.cern/news/press-release/cern/lhc-experiments-bring-new-insight-matter-primordial-universe"}, {"title": "New particle-like structure confirmed at the LHC", "date": "2012-11-15", "content": "Scientists on an experiment at the Large Hadron Collider confirmed this week the existence of a particle-like structure first observed at the LHC's predecessor, the Tevatron.

Now, they're working to figure out exactly what it is. Observed in collisions at an energy of 4.1 giga-electronvolts, the new structure seems to be composed of quarks and antiquarks. If that were the case, though, scientists would expect those quarks and antiquarks to fit together in a certain way. They don't seem to do so. Theoretically, the structure could be a hybrid composition of various particles: four quarks loosely bound together or even particles bound by the nuclear force, which is what holds protons and neutrons together in atoms. There's also the possibility that it's something entirely new. \"I don't know which explanation is right,\" says Kai Yi, a scientist with the University of Iowa who has worked on the analysis of Y(4140) at both CMS and CDF. \"We can't point at something and say, yes, this is it, yet.\" As happens with any discovery, the scientists now need to make precision measurements of the structure's properties. These include a more accurate measurement of its mass and the way it decays, among other factors. All of the measurements should paint a fuller picture.

Beams of protons zip around the LHC 11,245 times a second. Magnets in the accelerator are designed to bend and narrow those beams as they travel, but the particles are not always obedient. Some meander away from their tightly packed bunches, forming a halo that can derail the beam, damage accelerator components and create background noise. Systems known as collimators shave off the halo and deflect the rebellious particles out of the beam pipe. The result is a cleaner, more reliable beam. Scientists from the UA9 collaboration at CERN think they can trim particles more effectively by replacing the current primary collimators, which are made of carbon-carbon composite, with silicon crystals. The crystals, which are just 2 millimeters long, are 300 times smaller than the standard collimators. While carbon collimators immediately deflect particles in a general direction, crystals curve the path of the particles and reemit them with precision in a single direction. With both the carbon and crystal methods, errant particles are directed toward a second part of the collimation system, where they are absorbed by a massive target. Some particles escape the collimation system and continue to circle around the accelerator hundreds of times before they are caught. With crystal collimators, it is estimated those particles will make it around only a few times. To test how well the crystals would hold up against the power of the LHC, scientists directed around 50,000 billion protons with an energy of 450 billion electronvolts directly into the crystals. The test was meant to study how the crystals would react to a worst-case scenario involving a huge batch of high-energy particles hitting the crystals just after being injected into the LHC. Particles accelerated to high energies can severely damage equipment like magnets and detectors, so they need to be funneled out through exits, such as the collimators, without touching more sensitive components. But the particles traversing the crystals generate heat. There were concerns the high temperatures could damage or melt the crystals. \"This is a huge amount of power going into the crystal,\" UA9 spokesperson Walter Scandale says. \"The question is: Can such a small object sustain the same power that is absorbed with no difficulty by the current system?\" The crystals survived the particle blast, which took place inside the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator. In September and October, scientists also refined a system to orient the crystals. The crystal must be set at an extraordinarily precise angle that shifts depending on the energy of the beam. The system is now much more effective and ready to be tested in the LHC. \"We had two very strong technological challenges, and both have been solved this year,\" Scandale says. \"With these two results in the pocket, we are fully confident the transition to the LHC should be with no major difficulty.\" A prototype will be ready for testing when the LHC starts up again in 2014 at a collision energy of upwards of 13 trillion electronvolts. \"We are willing to test this kind of system in the LHC, where the situation is even more drastic and even more demanding than in the SPS accelerator,\" Scandale says.

Interconnections, some of which resemble long, copper fingers, ensure that electricity flows from one magnet to the next. These interconnections are installed at room temperature, but they must operate at well below freezing when the machine is turned on. The metal contracts by about 40 millimeters when this happens. Usually, the fingers manage to stay flat. But, occasionally, the fingers buckle, creating a bulge that can block a particle beam. Testing this with the actual beam would be a months-long, labor-intensive process, requiring cooling down the LHC and then warming it back up again to fix any identified problems. So scientists opt for a test that takes about 15 minutes per section instead. Rather than sending a beam through the pipe, they send the RF ball.

The state-of-the-art accelerator -- and teams of thousands of CERN-based scientists -- helped Peter Higgs win the Nobel Prize last year by proving his theories right. \"It's effectively a new machine, poised to set us on the path to new discoveries,\" CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said.", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/world-s-largest-atom-smasher-gearing-up-for-another-run-1.1881632"}, {"title": "CERN announces LHC restart schedule", "date": "2014-06-23", "content": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world, has started to get ready for its second three-year run. Cool down of the vast machine has already begun in preparation for research to resume early in 2015 following a long technical stop to prepare the machine for running at almost double the energy of run 1. The last LHC magnet interconnection was closed on 18 June 2014 and one sector of 1/8 of the machine has already been cooled to operating temperature. The accelerator chain that supplies the LHC's particle beams is currently starting up, with beam in the Proton Synchrotron accelerator last Wednesday for the first time since 2012. \"There is a new buzz about the laboratory and a real sense of anticipation,\" says CERN Director General Rolf Heuer, speaking at a press conference at the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) meeting in Copenhagen. \"Much work has been carried out on the LHC over the last 18 months or so, and it's effectively a new machine, poised to set us on the path to new discoveries.\" Over the last 16 months, the LHC has been through a major programme of maintenance and upgrading, along with the rest of CERN's accelerator complex, some elements of which have been in operation since 1959. Some 10,000 superconducting magnet interconnections were consolidated in order to prepare the LHC machine for running at its design energy. \"The machine is coming out of a long sleep after undergoing an important surgical operation,\" says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Bordry, CERN's Director for Accelerators and Technology. \"We are now going to wake it up very carefully and go through many tests before colliding beams again early next year. The objective for 2015 is to run the physics programme at 13 TeV.\" The LHC experiments also took advantage of this long pause to upgrade their particle detectors. \"The discovery of a Higgs boson was just the beginning of the LHC's journey,\" said senior CERN physicist Fabiola Gianotti at the same press conference. \"The increase in energy opens the door to a whole new discovery potential.\" The Higgs boson, first mentioned in a 1964 paper by Peter Higgs, is linked to the mechanism, proposed the same year by Higgs and independently by Robert Brout and Fran\u00e7ois Englert, that gives mass to fundamental particles. During its first three years, the LHC ran at a collision energy of 7 to 8 TeV delivering particle collisions to four major experiments: ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb. With the large amount of data provided by the LHC during this first period, the ATLAS and CMS experiments were able to announce the discovery of the long-sought Higgs boson on 4 July 2012, paving the way for the award of the 2013 Nobel Prize in physics to theorists Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs. By providing collisions at energies never reached in a particle accelerator before, the LHC will open a new window for potential discovery, allowing further studies on the Higgs boson and potentially addressing unsolved mysteries such as dark matter. The ordinary matter of which we, and everything visible in the universe is composed, makes up just 5% of what the universe is made of.

Why is more energy important? \"It all comes down to E = mc2,\" says physicist Josh Thompson, citing Albert Einstein's famous equation. So far, the LHC has run at 8 TeV (tera electron Volts). That's the \"E\" (Energy). During this next run, the \"E\" will be 13 TeV. \"When we get more 'E' we can hopefully get more 'm' [mass] stuff coming out,\" says Thompson, a Cornell University post-doctoral research associate currently based at CERN. And not just more mass, but probably heavier mass, heavier particles that could finally prove the existence of \"dark matter\". Be cool: Astrophysicists tell us that the matter we can detect - stars, planets, broccoli, etc. - makes up only 5% of the universe. The other 95% consists of \"dark energy\" (about 70%) and the rest of \"dark matter\". But nothing is known for sure about this Dark Universe, except that it must exist - just as the Higgs boson was thought to exist, but hadn't been proven until 2012.

Protons were generated by the LHC's source and blasted through a 'daisy-chain' of smaller accelerators before being intentionally smashed into a metaphorical brick wall. The particle beam didn't reach the LHC's famous 27 kilometre accelerator ring, they were stopped just short, but the event was used to begin calibration efforts of the massive experiment's detectors before the whole system is powered back up again early next year. The Large Hadron Collider, which is located at and managed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research near Geneva, Switzerland, was powered down in February 2013 for repairs and upgrades. Now, with the improvements complete, CERN engineers are testing and calibrating each component of the complex system before experiments can restart in 2015. \"These initial tests are a milestone for the whole accelerator chain,\" says the LHC's chief engineer Reyes Alemany Fernandez. \"Not only was this the first time the injection lines have seen beams in over a year, it was also our first opportunity to test the LHC's operation system. We successfully commissioned the LHC's injection and ejection magnets, all without beam in the machine itself.\" Before protons are 'fed' into the LHC's main ring to be accelerated to relativistic speeds by the circuit of superconducting electromagnets, a series of smaller accelerators are used, each one ramping-up the particles' energies before being passed to the next accelerator. Starting at the source, which is responsible for creating a reservoir of protons (hydrogen atoms are stripped of their electrons, leaving the positively-charged protons behind), the protons are fed into the Linac2 accelerator - the first boost on the proton beam's journey through the LHC. After Linac2, the particle beam is accelerated by the Proton Synchrotron Booster (a component that has seen some of the most radical upgrades since shutdown), then the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and then the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). But during this test, the high-speed protons were fed through the LHC injection lines, after being accelerated by the SPS, only to end their short journey smashing into 21.6 tons of graphite, aluminium and copper known as \"beam dumps.\" These dumps are used to absorb the energy of particle beams before they enter the LHC proper. This is useful during tests and can help prevent significant damage to the LHC's electromagnets and sensitive detectors should there be a fault or \"quench\" event. The purpose of these dumps is to diffuse the particle beam, thereby scattering its energy, and then absorbing the rest. However, as the beams are dumped, muons - subatomic particles that are basically high-mass electrons - are generated by the collisions and their signal can be detected by detectors along the LHC's main beam line. This provides LHC physicists with an opportunity to calibrate their detectors before the system is fully switched on. \"The experiments were given the precise timing of each beam dump, which allowed them to tune their detectors and trigger to the LHC clock,\" says Verena Kain, SPS supervisor. The next big milestone is February 2015 when particle beams will be unleashed into the LHC's main ring and accelerated to a new and exciting high-energy regime.", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/11/26/4136491.htm"}, {"title": "First LHC magnets prepped for restart", "date": "2014-12-10", "content": "This week, one-eighth of the LHC dipole magnets reached the energy they'll need to operate in 2015. Engineers at CERN powered 154 superconducting magnets to a current of around 11,000 amps. This is about a thousand times greater than an average household appliance and is required to make the 50-foot-long electromagnets powerful enough to bend particles moving close to the speed of light around the curves of the LHC. \"Over the summer we plan to ramp up the LHC to the highest energy ever achieved in a collider experiment,\" says Mirko Pojer, an LHC engineer-in- charge and co-leader of the magnet re-commissioning team. \"But before we do that, we need to make sure that our magnets are primed and ready for the job.\" From 2010 to 2013, the LHC produced proton-proton collisions of up to 8 trillion electronvolts. This first run allowed physicist to probe a previously inaccessible realm of physics and discover the Higgs boson. But the LHC is designed to operate at even higher energies, and physicists are eager to see what might be hiding just out of reach. \"We had a very successful first run and made a huge discovery, but we want to keep probing,\" says Greg Rakness, a UCLA researcher and CMS run coordinator. \"The exciting thing about the next run is that we have no idea what we could find, because we have never been able to access this energy realm before.\" To prepare the LHC for 13 trillion electronvolt proton-proton collisions, CERN shut down the machine for almost two years for upgrades and repairs. This involved reinforcing almost 1700 magnet interconnections, including more than 10,000 superconducting splices. Now that that work is completed, engineers are putting the LHC magnets through a strenuous training program. Like Rocky Balboa prepping for a big fight, the magnets must be pushed repeatedly to the limits of their operation. This will prime them for the strenuous running conditions of the LHC. The LHC magnets are superconducting, which means that when they are cooled down, current passes through them with zero electrical resistance. During powering, current is gradually increased in the magnetic coils, which sometimes generates tiny movements in the superconductor. These movements create friction, which in turn locally heats up the superconductor and makes it quench-or suddenly return to a non-superconducting state. When this occurs, the circuit is switched off and its energy is absorbed by huge resistors. \"By purposefully making the magnets quench, we can literally 'shake out' any unresolved tension in the coils and prep the magnets to hold a high current without losing their superconducting superpowers,\" says Matteo Solfaroli, an LHC engineer-in-charge and co-leader of the commissioning team. \"This is a necessary part of prepping the accelerator for the restart so that the magnets don't quench while we are running the beam.\" The magnets in all the other sectors will undergo similar training before being ready for operation. Many other tests will follow before beams can circulate in the LHC once more, next spring.", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/december-2014/first-lhc-magnets-prepped-for-restart"}, {"title": "LHC filled with liquid helium", "date": "2014-12-17", "content": "The Large Hadron Collider isn't just a cool particle accelerator. It's the coldest. Last week the cryogenics team at CERN finished filling the eight curved sections of the LHC with liquid helium. The LHC ring is now cooled to below 4 kelvin. This cool-down is an important milestone in preparing the LHC for its spring 2015 restart, after which physicists plan to use it to produce the highest- energy particle collisions ever achieved on Earth. \"We are delighted that the LHC is now cold again,\" says Beate Heinemann, the deputy leader of the ATLAS experiment and a physicist with the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \"We are getting very excited about the high-energy run starting in spring next year, which will open the possibility of finding new particles which were just out of reach.\" The LHC uses more than 1000 superconducting dipole magnets to bend high-energy particles around its circumference. These superconducting magnets are made from a special material that, when cooled close to absolute zero (minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit), can maintain a high electrical current with zero electrical resistance. \"These magnets have to produce an extremely strong magnetic field to bend the particles, which are moving at very close to the speed of light,\" says Mike Lamont, the head of LHC operations. \"The magnets are powered with high electrical currents whenever beam is circulating. Room-temperature electromagnets would be unable to support the currents required.\" To get the 16 miles of LHC magnets close to absolute zero, engineers slowly inject helium into a special cryogenic system surrounding the magnets and gradually reduce the temperature over the course of several months at a rate of one sector cooled per month. As the temperature drops, the helium becomes liquid and acts as a cold shell to keep the magnets at their operational temperature. \"Helium is a special element because it only becomes a liquid below 5 kelvin,\" says Laurent Tavian, the group leader of the CERN cryogenics team. \"It is also the only element which is not solid at very low temperature, and it is naturally inert-meaning we can easily store it and never have to worry about it becoming flammable.\" The first sector cool-down started in May 2014. Engineers first pre-cooled the helium using 9000 metric tons of liquid nitrogen. After the pre-cooling, engineers injected the helium into the accelerator. \"Filling the entire accelerator requires 130 metric tons of helium, which we received from our supplier at a rate of around one truckload every week,\" Tavian says. In January CERN engineers plan to have the entire accelerator cooled to its nominal operating temperature of 1.9 kelvin (minus 456 degrees Fahrenheit), colder than outer space.", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/december-2014/lhc-filled-with-liquid-helium"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Upgraded Large Hadron Collider Brings Atom Smashin' Back in Fashion", "date": "2015-02-04", "content": "After a two-year-long overhaul, thousands of researchers are getting ready to restart the $10 billion Large Hadron Collider - and this time, they're going to turn the world's most powerful particle-smasher up to the max. \"It's a new machine,\" Fermilab physicist Don Lincoln, a member of the science team behind the LHC's Compact Muon Solenoid detector, told NBC News.

On March 24, the European physics laboratory announced that a short circuit to ground had occurred in one of the connections with an LHC magnet. LHC magnets are superconducting, which means that they can maintain a high electrical current with zero electrical resistance. To be superconducting, the LHC magnets must be chilled to almost minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit. The short circuit occurred between a superconducting magnet and its diode. Diodes help protect the LHC's magnets by diverting electrical current into a parallel circuit if the magnets lose their superconductivity. When teams discovered the problem, all eight sections of the LHC were already cooled to operating temperature. To fix the problem, they knew that they might have to go through a weeks-long process of carefully rewarming and then recooling one section. The short circuit was caused by a fragment of metal caught between the magnet and the diode. After locating the fragment and examining it via X-ray, engineers and technicians decided to try to melt it. They could do this in a way similar to blowing a fuse. Importantly, the technique would not require them to warm up the magnets. They injected almost 400 amps of current into the diode circuit for a few milliseconds. Measurements made today showed the short circuit had disappeared. Now the teams must conduct further tweaks and tests and restart the final commissioning of the accelerator.

With the collider back in action, the more than 1700 US scientists who work on LHC experiments are prepared to join thousands of their international colleagues to study the highest-energy particle collisions ever achieved in the laboratory. These collisions - hundreds of millions of them every second - will lead scientists to new and unexplored realms of physics, and could yield extraordinary insights into the nature of the physical universe. A highlight of the LHC's first run, which began in 2009, was the discovery of the Higgs boson, the last in the suite of elementary particles that make up scientists' best picture of the universe and how it works. The discovery of the Higgs was announced in July 2012 by two experimental collaborations, ATLAS and CMS. Continuing to measure the properties of the Higgs will be a major focus of LHC Run 2. \"The Higgs discovery was one of the most important scientific achievements of our time,\" says James Siegrist, the US Department of Energy's Associate Director of Science for High Energy Physics. \"With the LHC operational again, at even higher energies, the possibilities for new discoveries are endless, and the United States will be at the forefront of those discoveries.\" During the LHC's second run, particles will collide at a staggering 13 teraelectronvolts (TeV), which is 60 percent higher than any accelerator has achieved before. The LHC's four major particle detectors - ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb - will collect and analyze data from these collisions, allowing them to probe new areas of research that were previously unattainable. At 17 miles around, the Large Hadron Collider is one of the largest machines ever built. The United States played a vital role in the construction of the LHC and the huge and intricate detectors for its experiments. Seven US Department of Energy national laboratories joined roughly 90 US universities to build key components of the accelerator, detectors and computing infrastructure, with funding from the DOE Office of Science and the National Science Foundation. The US contingent was part of an estimated 10,000 people from 113 different countries who helped to design, build, and upgrade the LHC accelerator and its four particle detectors. \"We are on the threshold of an exciting time in particle physics: the LHC will turn on with the highest energy beam ever achieved,\" says Fleming Crim, National Science Foundation Assistant Director for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. \"This energy regime will open the door to new discoveries about our universe that were impossible as recently as two years ago.\" In addition to the scientists pushing toward new discoveries on the four main experiments, the US provides a significant portion of the computing and data analysis - roughly 23 percent for ATLAS and 33 percent for CMS. US scientists on the ALICE experiment developed control and tracking systems for the detector and made significant contributions in software, hardware and computing support. US scientists also helped improve trigger software for data analysis for the LHCb experiment. US institutions will continue to make important contributions to the LHC and its experiments, even beyond the second run, which is scheduled to continue through the middle of 2018. Universities and national laboratories are developing new accelerator and detector technology for future upgrades of the LHC and its experiments. This ongoing work encourages a strong partnership between science and industry, and drives technological innovation in the United States. \"Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for,\" says CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. \"Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC.\"", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/us-scientists-celebrate-the-restart-of-the-lhc"}, {"title": "The Large Hadron Collider powers up again", "date": "2015-04-05", "content": "Scientists from the Particle Physics Research Group at the University of Bristol are celebrating the restarting of CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) today, after two years of upgrade work.

Papotti says there might be a few surprises along the way to bringing the world's largest machine back to life. \"There may be, for example, problems keeping the beam stable, and we also don't know how many times the magnets will quench-or suddenly lose their superconducting state-while the beam is running,\" Papotti says. \"It's experimental work.

It circulated its first protons of its second run on April 5. To generate the test collisions, engineers at CERN first accelerated proton beams inside the Super Proton Synchrotron and then diverted them into the LHC. Once inside the LHC, the two beams rotated at their injection energy of 450 giga-electronvolts before colliding in the centers of the four detectors. Engineers plan to run the two colliding beams for six continuous hours before diverting the leftover protons out of the machine and into a thick column of graphite. CERN engineers plan to circulate proton beams around the LHC with about 14 times more energy this summer. The teams responsible for getting the LHC up and running are about halfway through the eight-week period scheduled for commissioning. Over the next few weeks, they will continue to prepare the LHC for standard operation. Standard operation requires that the LHC can safety and continuously collide hundreds of billions of high-energy protons every 25 nanoseconds for eight to 12 hours a day, almost every day, says LHC lead engineer Giulia Papotti. \"Turning on a particle accelerator that is 27 kilometers long is very different than booting up your computer,\" Papotti says. \"It takes time, and we still have a number of safety systems we need to set up to protect the machine and the experiments from the high-energy beams of particles that will continuously course through the machine once we start routine operation.\" The experiments are using these last few weeks to finish calibrating their detectors and prepare for the huge influx of new data that will inundate their servers once the high-energy collisions start. \"We are very excited to see LHC collisions for the first time again in more than two years,\" says deputy head of the ATLAS experiment Beate Heinemann, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley. \"These collisions are an important step towards being fully ready for the high-energy collisions expected for June.\"", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/may-2015/lhc-sees-first-low-energy-collisions"}, {"title": "The Large Hadron Collider is smashing protons together again", "date": "2015-05-06", "content": "It's been a long wait, but finally CERN's Large Hadron Collider is back doing what it does best: smashing protons together.

This is one of the last important steps on the way toward data collection, which is scheduled for early June. As engineers ramp up the energy of the collider, the positions of the beams of particles change. The protons are also focused into much tighter packets, so getting two bunches to actually intersect requires very precise tuning. \"Colliding protons inside the LHC is equivalent to firing two needles 6 miles apart with such precision that they collide halfway,\" says Syracuse University physicist Sheldon Stone, a senior researcher on the LHCb experiment. \"It takes a lot of testing to make sure the two bunches meet at the right spot and do not miss each other.\" Engineers spent the last two years outfitting the LHC to collide protons at a higher energy and faster rate than ever before. Last month they successfully circulated low-energy protons around the LHC for the first time since the shutdown. Five days later, they broke their own energy record by ramping up the energy of a single proton beam to 6.5 trillion electronvolts. High-energy test collisions allow engineers to practice steering beams in the LHC. \"We have to find the positions where the two beams cross, so what we do is steer the beams up and down and left and right until we get the optimal collision rate,\" says CERN engineer Ronaldus SuykerBuyk of the operations team. In addition to finding the collision sweet spots, engineers will also use these tests to finish calibrating the machine components and positioning the collimators, which protect the accelerator and detectors from stray particles. The design of the LHC allows more than 2800 bunches of protons to circulate in the machine at a time. But the LHC operations team is testing the machine with just one or two bunches per beam to ensure all is running smoothly. The next important milestone will be preparing the LHC to consistently and safely ramp, steer and collide proton beams for up to eight consecutive hours. Declaring stable beams will be only the beginning for the LHC operations team. \"The machine evolves around you,\" says CERN engineer Jorg Wenninger. \"There are little changes over the months. There's the reproducibility of the magnets. And the alignment of the machine moves a little with the slow-changing geology of the area.

Today it began colliding particles at a steady rate to provide data for research. This time around, the LHC is colliding particles at 13 trillion electronvolts, a 60 percent boost from its 2012 record of 8 TeV. \"Because we have higher energy, more particles are produced more frequently,\" says Beate Heinemann, ATLAS deputy spokesperson and physicist at the University of California in Berkeley at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \"We will be able to test theories we've never been able to test before.\" Inside the LHC, highly energetic protons collide and briefly convert their energy to mass. This produces other particles. The higher the amount of energy in the collisions, the more massive the particles they can produce. Physicists discovered the Higgs boson in 8 TeV collisions; there may be more to come at 13 TeV. Notably, many scientists hope to discover Supersymmetry, a theoretical model that predicts more massive partner particles for each known fundamental particle. Also on the roster of potential discoveries are dark matter particles. Scientists have seen evidence that most of the matter in the Universe is dark matter, but they have never knowingly produced it in the laboratory. Scientists might even find something they don't expect, says Jim Olsen, CMS physics co-coordinator and professor of physics at Princeton University. \"It's exciting to me that in searching for things we have predicted, or we think might be there, we could find something completely unexpected.\" By increasing the energy and brightness of their particle beams, physicists are multiplying their odds of detecting rare particle events. Particles and their decay processes might be bumped up by a factor of tens or hundreds. Scientists expect to produce Higgs bosons more than twice as fast as before. This is why scientists say we are now in the \"precision era\" of the Higgs boson. The more Higgs bosons they can produce, the more precisely they can study their properties. \"By the end of 2015, the LHC could deliver the same amount of data on the Higgs as we collected over 2011 and 2012 combined,\" Olsen says. By the end of 2017, physicists could be working with three to four times more Higgs data than was collected over the first run. To take advantage of the upgraded accelerator, the ATLAS, ALICE, CMS and LHCb scientific collaborations made improvements to their detectors. Scientists have also upgraded the computing infrastructure that stores and disseminates the onslaught of data the detectors collect. Publications on 2015 data could begin rolling out as early as this fall, which could include first analyses of searches for heavy particles. Olsen predicts that new Higgs boson results will likely be released by spring 2016.

Neither reported finding was solid enough to claim discovery, but both experiments reported hints of a signal in exactly the same spot in the data, which was promising.", "url": "https://gizmodo.com/hopes-are-fading-fast-for-possible-new-particle-at-the-1782528119"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Physicists Have Discovered What Looks Like an Entire Family of New Particles in The LHC", "date": "2016-07-01", "content": "Physicists working with the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment have discovered what appears to be an entire family of new particles that our current physics models can't explain. The existence of these new forms of matter, known as tetraquarks, challenges our current understanding of the role they play inside the protons and neutrons that make up atoms - the fundamental building blocks of everything we know and love in the Universe. \"We looked at every known particle and process to make sure these four structures couldn't be explained by any pre-existing physics,\" one of the team, Thomas Britton from Syracuse University, told Sarah Charley at Symmetry. \"It was like baking a six-dimensional cake with 98 ingredients and no recipe - just a picture of a cake.\" So first off, what's a tetraquark? In their simplest form, quarks are minuscule particles that accumulate inside the protons and neutrons inside atoms, smashing about and annihilating each other at near-light speed. As this video by Physics Girl explains, according to the current standard model of physics, quarks can come in six different types, or 'flavours': up, down, top, bottom, strange and charm. They're all held together by even smaller particles called gluons, and depending on their mass, are classified as heavy or light. Until recently, it was thought that quarks only come in groups of two or three, but in 2014, physicists at the LHCb - one of seven particle physics detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider accelerator at CERN in Switzerland - confirmed the existence of a four-quark particle called a tetraquark. Then last year, they one-upped this discovery by confirming the existence of another type of quark - a five-quark particle, or pentaquark. None of this was easy, as experienced by a separate team of researchers from the Fermilab particle physics facility near Chicago, who announced that they too had discovered a new tetraquark earlier this year, only to be met with a whole lot of scepticism. But now the Syracuse team at the LHCb - which offers far more detection sensitivity than the Fermilab particle accelerator - has identified four new types of tetraquarks that appear to belong to the same exotic family. \"What we have discovered is a unique system,\" says one of the team, Tomasz Skwarnicki. \"We have four exotic particles of the same type; it's the first time we have seen this and this discovery is already helping us distinguish between the theoretical models.\" The new particles have been named X(4140), X(4274), X(4500), and X(4700) after their respective masses, and each one has been found to contain a unique combination of two charm quarks and two strange quarks. This makes them the first four-quark particles found to be composed entirely of heavy quarks, Symmetry reports. By 'exciting' the individual quarks inside their new tetraquark particles, the researchers were able to observe their unique internal structure, mass, and quantum numbers. In doing so, they discovered something that doesn't fit with current physics models that work with so-called ordinary particles, such as composite hadrons built from either a quark and an anti-quark, or three separate quarks, CERN reports. Physics are now trying to come up with new models to explain their results. The results have been published in two papers on the pre-print website arXiv.org here and here, so are now going to be scrutinised by independent physicists ahead of the formal peer-review process. The team is expecting one of two possibilities to be confirmed with further research: theoretical psycists are either going to have to explain the existence of this new family of particles, or they could be idenfified as the result of strange 'ripple effects' emanating from never-before-seen behaviours of existing particles. \"The molecular explanation does not fit with the data,\" Skwarnicki told Charley at Symmetry. \"But I personally would not conclude that these are definitely tightly bound states of four quarks. It could be possible that these are not even particles. The result could show the complex interplays of known particle pairs flippantly changing their identities.\"", "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-just-discovered-an-entire-family-of-new-particles-in-the-lhc"}, {"title": "A Physicist Has a New Hypothesis to Explain The LHC's Mysterious Results", "date": "2016-07-29", "content": "Since March, physicists around the world have been getting cautiously excited about a series of strange flashes of energy detected by CERN's Large Hadron Collider.

This could have been the first sign of a particle 800 times heavier than a proton that could fit the predictions of supersymmetry. A flood of more than 500 theory papers followed in an attempt to explain it. But after adding the data taken at the LHC so far in 2016, the bump went away.

Those collisions are adding up: This year alone the LHC has produced roughly the same number of collisions as it did during all of the previous years of operation together. This faster collision rate enables scientists to learn more about rare processes and particles such as Higgs bosons, which the LHC produces about once every billion collisions. \"Every time the protons collide, it's like the spin of a roulette wheel with several billion possible outcomes,\" says Jim Olsen, a professor of physics at Princeton University working on the CMS experiment. \"From all these possible outcomes, only a few will teach us something new about the subatomic world. A high rate of collisions per second gives us a much better chance of seeing something rare or unexpected.\" Since April, the LHC has produced roughly 2.4 quadrillion particle collisions in both the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The unprecedented performance this year is the result of both the incremental increases in collision rate and the sheer amount of time the LHC is up and running. \"This year the LHC is stable and reliable,\" says Jorg Wenninger, the head of LHC operations. \"It is working like clockwork. We don't have much downtime.\" Scientists predicted that the LHC would produce collisions around 30 percent of the time during its operation period. They expected to use the rest of the time for maintenance, rebooting, refilling and ramping the proton beams up to their collision energy. However, these numbers have flipped; the LHC is actually colliding protons 70 percent of the time. \"The LHC is like a juggernaut,\" says Paul Laycock, a physicist from the University of Liverpool working on the ATLAS experiment. \"We took around a factor of 10 more data compared to last year, and in total we already have more data in Run 2 than we took in the whole of Run 1. Of course the biggest difference between Run 1 and Run 2 is that the data is at twice the energy now, and that's really important for our physics program.\" This unexpected performance comes after a slow start-up in 2015, when scientists and engineers still needed to learn how to operate the machine at that higher energy. \"With more energy, the machine is much more sensitive,\" says Wenninger. \"We decided not to push it too much in 2015 so that we could learn about the machine and how to operate at 13 [trillion electronvolts]. Last year we had good performance and no real show-stoppers, so now we are focusing on pushing up the luminosity.\" The increase in collision rate doesn't come without its difficulties for the experiments. \"The number of hard drives that we buy and store the data on is determined years before we take the data, and it's based on the projected LHC uptime and luminosity,\" Olsen says. \"Because the LHC is outperforming all estimates and even the best rosy scenarios, we started to run out of disk space. We had to quickly consolidate the old simulations and data to make room for the new collisions.\" The increased collision rate also increased the importance of vigilant detector monitoring and adjustments of experimental parameters in real time. All the LHC experiments are planning to update and upgrade their experimental infrastructure in winter 2017. \"Even though we were kept very busy by the deluge of data, we still managed to improve on the quality of that data,\" says Laycock. \"I think the challenges that arose thanks to the fantastic performance of the LHC really brought the best out of ATLAS, and we're already looking forward to next year.\" Astonishingly, 2.4 quadrillion collisions represent just 1 percent of the total amount planned during the lifetime of the LHC research program. The LHC is scheduled to run through 2037 and will undergo several rounds of upgrades to further increase the collision rate. \"Do we know what we will find? Absolutely not,\" Olsen says. \"What we do know is that we have a scientific instrument that is unprecedented in human history, and if new particles are produced at the LHC, we will find them.\"", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/lhc-smashes-old-collision-records"}, {"title": "Large Hadron Collider could discover mysterious dark matter and unlock 'parallel universe'", "date": "2016-12-17", "content": "A study by the University of California, Irvine, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, has suggested there may be a fifth force of nature that could be found by the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.

Shortly after the discovery of the Higgs, the LHC was shut down for two full years for a full servicing and upgrade. The extreme conditions created in the collider - think \"big bang\" extreme - were achieved at 8 teraelectronvolts, the unit of energy they use to gauge the power of the accelerated protons slamming into each other. You create greater forces snapping your fingers, but when you concentrate it into a space millions of times smaller, you can essentially puncture the fabric of reality. Eight TeV was already an immense increase over the next most powerful system - and the complex is now running at 13 TeV, with plans to go even higher. \"The design of the LHC was to reach 14 TeV, but the machine has been working very well, so everyone has the idea that we can push past that,\" LHC physicist Arturo S\u00e1nchez Pineda told me.

LHC scientists have also accelerated lead nuclei stripped of their electrons. Today, for just about eight hours, they are experimenting with a different kind of nucleus: xenon. Xenon is a heavy noble gas that exists in trace quantities in the air. Xenon nuclei are about 40 percent lighter than lead nuclei, so xenon-xenon collisions have a different geometry and energy distribution than lead-lead collisions. \"When two high-energy nuclei collide, they can momentarily form a droplet of quark gluon plasma, the primordial matter that filled our universe just after the big bang,\" says Peter Steinberg, a physicist at the US Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory and a heavy-ion coordinator for the ATLAS experiment at CERN. \"The shape of the colliding nuclei influences the initial shape of this droplet, which in turn influences how the plasma flows and finally shows up in the angles of the particles we measure. We're hoping that these smaller droplets from xenon-xenon collisions give us deeper insight into how this still-mysterious process works at truly subatomic length scales.\" Not all particles that travel through CERN's long chain of interconnected accelerators wind up in the LHC. Earlier this year, scientists were loading xenon ions into the accelerator and firing them at a fixed-target experiment instead. \"We can have particles from two different sources feeding into CERN's accelerator complex,\" says Michaela Schaumann, a physicist in LHC operation working on the heavy-ion program. \"The LHC's injectors are so flexible that, once everything is set up properly, they can alternate between accelerating protons and accelerating ions a few times a minute.\" Having the xenon beam already available provided an opportunity to send xenon into the LHC for first (and potentially only) time. It took some serious additional work to bring the beam quality up to collider levels, Schaumann says, but today it was ready to go. \"We are keeping the intensities very low in order to fulfil machine protection requirements and be able to use the same accelerator configuration we apply during the proton-proton runs with xenon beams,\" Schaumann says. \"We needed to adjust the frequency of the accelerator cavities [because more massive xenon ions circulate more slowly than protons], but many of the other machine settings stayed roughly the same.\" This novel run tests scientists' knowledge of beam physics and shows the flexibility of the LHC. Scientists say they are hopeful it could reveal something new. \"We can learn a lot about the properties of the hot, dense matter from smaller collision systems,\" Steinberg says. \"They are a valuable bridge to connect what we observe in lead-lead collisions to strikingly similar observations in proton-proton interactions.\"", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/xenon-takes-a-turn-in-the-lhc"}, {"title": "Record luminosity: well done LHC", "date": "2017-11-13", "content": "It's the end of the road for the protons this year after a magnificent performance from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). On Friday, the final beams of the 2017 proton run circulated in the LHC. The run ended, as it does every year, with a round up of the luminosity performance, the indicator by which the effectiveness of a collider is measured and on which the operators keep a constant eye. The LHC has far exceeded its target for 2017. It has provided its two major experiments, ATLAS and CMS, with 50 inverse femtobarns of data, i.e. 5 billion million collisions. The inverse femtobarn (fb-1) is the unit used to measure integrated luminosity, or the cumulative number of potential collisions over a given period. This result is all the more remarkable because the machine experts had to overcome a serious setback. A vacuum problem in the beam pipe of a magnet cell limited the number of bunches that could circulate in the machine. Several teams were brought in to find a solution. Notably, the arrangement of the bunches in the beams was changed. After a few weeks, luminosity started to increase again. At the same time, over the course of the year, the operators have optimised the operating parameters. Using a new system put in place this year, they have notably reduced the size of the beams when they meet at the centre of the experiments. The more squeezed the beams, the more collisions occur each time they meet. Last year, the operators managed to obtain 40 collisions at each bunch crossing, with each bunch containing 100 billion particles. In 2017, up to 60 collisions were produced at each crossing. Thanks to these improvements, the instantaneous luminosity record was smashed, reaching 2.06 x 1034cm-2s-1, or twice the nominal value. Instantaneous luminosity corresponds to the potential number of collisions per second. The LHC will continue to operate for another two weeks for two special runs including a week for operation studies. The first special run will consist of carrying out proton collisions at 5.02 TeV (as opposed to the usual 13 TeV), the same energy as that planned for next year's lead-ion runs. This will enable physicists to collect data with protons, which they will then be able to compare with the lead-ion data. The second special run, at very low luminosity, will provide data for the TOTEM and ATLAS/ALFA experiments. These two experiments use detectors located on either side of two large LHC detectors: CMS in the case of TOTEM and ATLAS in the case of ATLAS/ALFA. They study interactions called elastic scattering, where two protons merely change direction slightly when they interact, rather than colliding. For these studies, the LHC makes the beams as wide as possible. What's more, the energy will be limited to 450 GeV, i.e. the energy at which beams are injected from the accelerator complex into the LHC. Finally, the operators will carry out a \"machine development\" campaign. Over a week, they will perform operating tests to improve the accelerator's performance still further (it can never be too good) and begin to prepare the High-Luminosity LHC, which will take over from the LHC after 2025.

The project involves 29 institutes based in 13 countries and was formally approved by the CERN Council in June 2016, followed by prototyping of elements of the hardware that will go into modifying the 27-km collider ring. CERN says that the new work will require replacing 1.2 km of the ring and swapping out various magnets, collimators, and radiofrequency cavities at the LHC's two main sites in France and Switzerland.

On July 25, for the very first time, operators injected not just atomic nuclei but lead atoms containing a single electron into the LHC. This was one of the first proof-of-principle tests for a new idea called the Gamma Factory, part of CERN's Physics Beyond Colliders project. \"We're investigating new ideas of how we could broaden the present CERN research program and infrastructure,\" says Michaela Schaumann, an LHC engineer. \"Finding out what's possible is the first step.\" During normal operation, the LHC produces a steady stream of proton-proton collisions. For about four weeks, just before the annual winter shutdown, scientists smash together atomic nuclei. But for a handful of days a year, during periods of machine development, accelerator physicists get to try something completely new. Previously, researchers accelerated xenon nuclei in the LHC and tested other kinds of partially stripped lead ions in the Super Proton Synchrotron, the second largest machine in CERN's accelerator complex. \"This special LHC run was really the last step in a series of tests,\" says physicist Witold Krasny, who is coordinating a group of about 50 scientists to develop new ways to produce high-energy gamma rays. Accelerating lead nuclei with a remaining electron can be challenging because of how delicate these atoms are. \"It's really easy to accidentally strip off the electron,\" explains Schaumann. \"When that happens, the nucleus crashes into the wall of the beam pipe because its charge is no longer synchronized with the LHC's magnetic field.\" During the first run, operators injected 24 bunches of atoms and achieved a low-energy stable beam inside the LHC for about an hour. Then they ramped the LHC up to its full power and maintained the beam for about two minutes before it was ejected into the beam dump. \"If too many particles go off course, the LHC automatically dumps the beam,\" says Schaumann. \"Our main priority is to protect the LHC and its magnets.\" After running the magnets through the restart cycle, Schaumann and her colleagues tried again, this time with only 6 bunches. They kept the beam circulating for two hours before intentionally dumping it. \"We predicted that the lifetime of this special kind of beam inside the LHC would be at least 15 hours,\" says Krasny. \"We were surprised to learn the lifetime is about 40 hours.\" Physicists are doing these tests to see if the LHC could one day operate as a gamma ray factory. In this scenario, scientists would shoot the circulating atoms with a laser, causing the electron to jump into a higher energy level. As the electron falls back down, it spits out a particle of light. In normal circumstances, this particle of light would not be very energetic, but because the atom would already be moving at close to the speed of light, the energy of the emitted photon would get boosted and its wavelength squeezed. These gamma rays would have sufficient energy to produce normal matter particles, such as quarks, electrons and even muons. Because matter and energy are two sides of the same coin, these high-energy gamma rays would transform into massive particles and could even morph into new kinds of matter, such as dark matter. They could also be the source for new types of particle beams, such as a muon beam. Even though this is still a long way off, the tests this week were an important first step in seeing what is possible. \"The beam lifetime really exceeded our predictions,\" said Krasny. \"Now the question is if we can preserve the same beam lifetime at a higher intensity by optimizing the collimator settings, which were still set up for protons during this special run.\"", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/lhc-accelerates-its-first-atoms"}, {"title": "The Large Hadron Collider Just Successfully Accelerated Its First Atoms", "date": "2018-07-30", "content": "The Large Hadron Collider below Switzerland and France has just accelerated its first atoms to almost the speed of light, and the results have \"exceeded predictions\".

Experiments at the LHC led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, and since then have given us a slew of strange new subatomic particles, tantalising hints of new physics, as well as helping to confirm the limits of reality.

The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC in 2012 confirmed the existence of the Higgs field, which gives elementary particles mass. It is a fundamental part of the standard model of particle physics. The new finding is important because it opens up the possibility for scientists to closely examine the behavior of the Higgs boson, such as whether it could interact with new, undiscovered particles. \"One of our main goals is to measure the Higgs decay rates, and the dominant Higgs decay is this bottom-quark channel. About 60 percent of Higgs bosons should decay into bottom quarks,\" said Jason Nielsen, professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz and associate director of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP). \"If we measure all the predicted ways the Higgs can decay and they don't sum up to 100 percent, it could mean there is something else coupling to the Higgs, like dark matter.\" The detection of the Higgs-to-bottom-quarks decay was announced jointly by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN, the European particle physics lab in Geneva, Switzerland, where the LHC is located. After several years of refining their techniques and gradually incorporating more data, both experiments finally saw evidence of the Higgs decaying to bottom quarks that exceeds the 5-sigma threshold of statistical significance typically required to claim a discovery.

The installation is the first of a series of sub-system upgrades to the CMS experiment that will allow it to operate at a five-fold-increased proton- proton collision rate at the LHC. Florida Tech aerospace, physics and space sciences professor Marcus Hohlmann and his doctoral and undergraduate students had constructed and tested a set of eight large Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector modules in the physics high-bay laboratory of the Olin Physical Sciences building in 2018. These GEMs, together with a large number of identical modules produced by other CMS groups in Belgium, Germany, India, Italy and at CERN, were then instrumented with custom-made readout electronics at CERN in 2019 and subjected to a variety of stringent performance tests through this summer. Last month, the collaboration completed the underground installation of all GEM detectors in the endcap \"nose\" of the CMS muon detection system. This sub-system detects and analyzes muons, an elementary particle and heavier cousin of the familiar electron. Muons are an important tool in particle physics because they are relatively easy to detect and many interesting, short-lived particles decay into muons. In fact, earlier this year the CMS collaboration reported the first experimental evidence for rare decays of the famed Higgs boson into two muons - in essence confirming a prediction by the standard model of particle physics. The new GEM detectors are now being commissioned at CERN to run in concert with the other CMS sub-detectors to get them ready for detecting muons from collisions in 2021. That is when the LHC and the associated accelerator complex will resume operations after a shutdown for maintenance and upgrades. Over the next several years, Hohlmann and his students are looking forward to a big harvest of muons measured with an instrument that they helped build at Florida Tech. They will be sifting through the new muon data to hunt for dark matter particles that may have been produced at the LHC and decayed into muons.", "url": "https://news.fit.edu/engineering/florida-tech-hardware-installed-in-large-hadron-collider/"}, {"title": "CERN anticipates first test beams will circulate in the LHC in the lhc in september 2021", "date": "2020-12-01", "content": "CERN anticipates the first test beams will circulate in the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at the end of September 2021, following scheduled shutdowns to allow important repair and upgrade work to take place.

The other major upgrade is an upgrade of the injector complex: what we call the chain of machines that's used to accelerate particles from the hydrogen gas bottle, which is where we get all our protons from, up to nearly the speed of light by the time they come into the LHC. And then in the LHC itself, we've undergone a consolidation of our superconducting magnets; so we have around 12,000 of these big superconducting magnets, which are used basically to bend the protons in this large circle that we have, allowing them to come round and round and round again and again, to provide us with collisions for a very long time.", "url": "https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/interviews/large-hadron-collider-restart-2021"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Successful Installation of the CMS Pixel Tracker at the Large Hadron Collider", "date": "2021-08-11", "content": "After more than two years of maintenance and upgrades, the Pixel Tracker has been installed at the center of the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider and is now ready for commissioning.

In the core of the detector, it reconstructs the paths of high-energy electrons, muons, and electrically charged hadrons, but also the decay of very short- lived particles such as those containing beauty or \"b\" quarks. Those decays are used, among other things, to study the differences between matter and antimatter. The Pixel Tracker is composed of concentric layers and rings of 1800 small silicon modules. Each of these modules contains about 66,000 individual pixels, for a total of 120 million pixels. The pixels' tiny size (100\u00d7150 \u03bcm2) allows the trajectory of a particle passing through the detector to be precisely measured and its origin determined with a precision of about 10 \u03bcm. Due to its location very close to the IP, the Pixel Tracker suffers a great deal of radiation damage from particle collisions. In the innermost layer, a mere 2.9 cm away from the beam pipe, around 600 million particles pass through one square centimeter of the detector every second.
