The name comes courtesy of Clara Ma, a 12-year-old sixth-grade student at Sun flower Elementary school in Lenexa, Kan. \"We have been eager to call therover by name,\" said Pete Theisinger, who manages the JPL team building and testing Curiosity. \"Giving it a name worthy of this mission's quest means a lot to the people working on it.\" The roveris expected to launch in 2011. A NASA panel selected the name following a nationwide student contest that attracted more than 9,000 proposals via the Internet and mail. Name suggestions from the Mars Science Laboratory project leaders and a non-binding public poll also were considered. \"Students from every state suggested names for this rover. That's testimony to the excitement Mars missions spark in our next generation of explorers,\" said Mark Dahl,the mission's program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Many of the nominating essays were excellent and several of the names would have fit well. I am especially pleased with the choice, which recognizes something universally human and essential to science.\" Ma decidedto enter the rover-naming contest after she heard about it at her school. \"I wasreally interested in space, but I thought space was something I could only readabout in books and look at during the night from so far away,\" Ma said. \"I thought that I would never be able to get close to it, so for me,naming the Mars rover would at least be one step closer.\" \"Curiosityis an everlasting flame that burns in everyone's mind. It makes me get out ofbed in the morning and wonder what surprises life will throw at me thatday,\" Ma wrote in her winning essay. \"Curiosity is such a powerfulforce. Without it, we wouldn't be who we are today. Curiosity is the passionthat drives us through our everyday lives. We have become explorers andscientists with our need to ask questions and to wonder.\" As herprize, Ma wins a trip to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif., where she will be invited to sign her name directly onto the rover as itis being assembled. Walt DisneyStudios Motion Pictures supplied the prizes for the contest, including 30 forsemifinalists related to \"WALL-E.\" Nine finalists have been invitedto provide messages to be placed on a microchip mounted on Curiosity. Themicrochip also will contain the names of thousands of people around the worldwho have \"signed\" their names electronically via the Internet.Additional electronic signatures still are being accepted via the Internet. Curiositywill be larger and more capable than any craft previously sent to land on thered planet.

This super-limb must lift 34 kilograms (almost 75 pounds) of instruments to reach out and test martian rocks and soil, which may hold clues about whether Mars could have supported life. Longer than most people are tall, the arm also provides heavy-duty support for the sampling drill. The drill requires a lot of \"muscle\" to hold it still on the rock. But, the arm isn't all brawn - it must delicately deposit the precious drill samples inside the rover for further testing. So, how does the rover train to do all this heavy-lifting?

The immense heat shield will shroud the Mars Science Laboratory rover, now named Curiosity, to protect it during its deep space cruise to Mars and the searingheat of entry into the Martian atmosphere. Lockheed Martin unveiled the heat shield this week and delivered its conical backshell to NASA last year. \"The Mars Science Laboratory aeroshell is the most complex capsule to fly to Mars,\" said RichHund, program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co. \"The design had toaddress the large size and weight of the rover, the largest ever sent to Mars,and the requirement for landing at a more-precise point on Mars.\" Curiosity's heat shield and conical backshell are the largest ever built for flight. Together they make up the rover's 15-foot (4.5-meter) wide aero shell larger than those used with previous Marsrovers and even than the shell used for NASA's Apollo spacecraft thatferried astronauts back from the moon. The Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity were protected by shells measuring 8.5 feet (2.6 meters) and the Apollo capsule'sheat shield measured just under 13 feet (less than 4 meters). As the rover, which is about the size of a small car, descends over the red planet thefriction it creates with the thin Martian atmosphere could create temperaturesup to 3,800 degrees Fahrenheit (2,100 degrees Celsius) on the outside of theshield. To withstand the heat, the shield is tiled with a material called a PhenolicImpregnated Carbon Ablator. This will be the first time the heat shield typehas flown on a Mars mission. Invented inNASA's Ames Research Center, the material first flew as the heat shield for the agency's Stardust sample return capsule, which collected particles from a cometand returnedthem to Earth in 2006. NASA has anintricate landing sequence planned for the new Curiosity rover. After entering the Martian atmosphere, the rover will slow itself with a parachute andjettison its heat shield and back shell before beginning a powered descent withthrusters on a so-called \"sky crane.\" The crane will lower the roverto the ground on cables and then fly itself off and crash.

Now engineers are taking a closelook at the car-sized rover's nuclear power plant. Engineers preparing the Curiosity rover for its planned launch in 2011 found a slightly faster than expected degradation rate in the rover's multi-mission radioisotope thermo electric generator, or MMRTG for short. The MMRTG is designed to enhance the rover's range and operability and lifetime onthe red planet. The unit uses some 10 pounds of plutonium dioxide,mostly plutonium-238, as a heat source. \"Rightnow we are working with Department of Energy to try and understand it,\" McCuistion told SPACE.com, \"but to-date the only impact is expected to be someoperational work-arounds in Martian winter's lower operational pace essentially because it'll take longer to charge the batteries.\" Curiosity's MMRTG power plant is currently fully fueled and storedat the Idaho National Laboratory, where it is awaiting delivery to the rover's launch site in Cape Canaveral, Fla., next year Graphic: HowMars Science Laboratory works. Optimisticfor Mars. The radioisotopethermoelectric generator oddity is the latest in a host of technological teething problems of the now roughly $2.3 billion mission led to a slip in itslaunch from 2009 to next year. Althoughchallenges still remain in getting the nuclear-powered rover spiffed up andready for sendoff to Mars, many of those problems have been resolved includinga potentially serious issue with the probe's metal skeleton. Acontractor had falsified documentation as to the qualityof titanium it had supplied to the aerospace community. That forced NASA tobacktrack through paperwork to assure that the Curiosity rover didn't use batches ofthe \"wrong stuff.\" Thepaperwork to sort through the use of titanium on Curiosity is now over 90percent complete, \"and no show stoppers, so I am feeling cautiously optimisticthat MSL will not be impacted,\" said Doug McCuistion, Director of the NASA MarsExploration Program in Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile,the science community is revving up to make use of Curiosity and its suite of sciencegear. \"The key technological and schedule problems are being solved and the Mars communityis quite pleased,\" noted John Mustard of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He's also chair of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group, chartedby NASA to assist in planning the scientific explorationof the red planet. This September Mars scientists will take part in the fourth landing site workshop for Curiosity. That meeting will focus on the outstanding science questions and relativemerits of the final Mars Science Laboratory's potential landing sites thatremain under deliberation. According to JohnGrant of the Smithsonian's Center for Earth and Planetary Studies and MattGolombek of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory -- the co-chairs of the Mars LandingSite Steering Committee -- the process of selecting Curiosity's landing site isconverging. Nearly 60 sites for the mission's planned touchdown have been mulled over for more than three years.Only Eberswalde crater, Gale crater, Holden crater, and Mawrth Vallis remain. Grant and Golombekreport that each of these sites represents exciting science opportunities forMSL and has been highly rated by the science community. A fifth site may beadded to the list, a decision that will be forthcoming in May by the MSLproject with input from the MSL Landing Site Steering Committee. Avatar in red? Along with animpressive array of research duties, the Curiosity rover's imaging andscientific suite will be the most capable education and public outreach packageever placed on the surface of another planet and given a successfulMars landing promises to provide awesome images and movies. One new capacitybeing re-evaluated is to imbue Curiosity with a zoom 3D camera capability. Malin Space ScienceSystems in San Diego, California is building it for Oscar-winning director,James Cameron, who recently delivered Avatar, his blockbuster cinematic experience. Cameron is a memberof the MSL science team, firmly focused on video documentation and traversescience using the rover's MastCam, the Mars Hand Lens Imager, and theMars Descent Imager that will record in ride-along video fashion the final two minutes of landing. Earlier plans to haveMastCamzoom were scrapped to meet acceptable technical, schedule and cost riskstandards in 2007. But the idea is back on the table, maybe. Today, the rover's fixed MastCam is already built and delivered,and can fly on MSL as planned if the zoom version doesn't come together intime. \"But if it does, and if it passes qualification tests without holding up the MSL schedule, it could be swapped onto the rover,\" NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown told SPACE.com. \"NASA has tentatively agreed, and is paying forthe new work on the zoom, which is expected to cost about $5 million.

The cameras, known collectively as the Mast Camera, will be mounted to the mast of Curiosity rover, formerly known as the MarsScience Laboratory, which is slated to launch on a $2.3billion mission in 2011. NASA's robotic Mars explorer Curiosity is the latest in along line of robots aimed at the red planet. It is much larger than the twinrovers Spirit and Opportunity currently exploring Mars and ispowered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, which converts heat shed bydecaying plutonium into energy, instead of solar arrays. Curiosity will carry an ambitious set of instruments yet forstudying Mars up close to understand the planet's past, present and potentialto host primitive life at any time in its history. The rover's cameras,naturally, are at the core of that science mission. Zoom views on Mars? The cameras were originally intended to include a zoomfunction that would allow them to take close, telephoto looks at targets andthen shift back to a wide-angle view when required. But NASA scrappeddevelopment of the zoom lens in 2007 as a cost-cutting measure. In its place, the Fixed Focal Length Mastcam was built byMalin Space Science Systems, Inc. - a veteran builder of red planetcameras - and delivered to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., to be installed on the rover. This camera system does contain atelephoto lens, providing the rover with long-distance reconnoitering capability. The current Mastcamcameras are capable of taking full color images similar to thosetaken by consumer digital cameras. When mounted to the mast of Curiosity, thecameras can be panned and tilted to provide image coverage around the rover, aswell as both near the rover and out to the horizon. While the Mastcams have fixed focal lengths of 34millimeters and 100 millimeters, and relatively small fields ofview, they will be used to build up coverage from aseries of small individual images as they pan over the Martian landscape aroundthe rover. The Mastcams can also provide high-definition color video. Race to finish. Zoom capabilities may still be within reach for theCuriosity rover, however, as NASA recently decided to fund the completion ofthe zoom cameras. If the zoom cameras can be assembled and checked by MSSS inthe time for the MSL rover's final testing early next year, there is still thepossibility that the Fixed Focal Length Mastcams may be swapped out for thezoom versions, rover engineers said. \"The fixed focal length Mastcams we just delivered willdo almost all of the science we originally proposed,\" said Michael Malin,Mastcam principal investigator. \"But they cannot provide a wide field ofview with comparable eye stereo. With the zoom Mastcams, we'll be able to takecinematic video sequences in 3-D on the surface of Mars.\" That 3-D video capability on Mars would be a boon for fameddirector James Cameron, whose latest film \"Avatar\" has been a 3-Dphenomenon, since he is also the public engagement co-investigator for Curiosity's Mars Science Laboratory mission.

Testing for the JPL-managed Mars Science Laboratory or MSL project included suspending a full-scale engineering model of the MSL rover from a helicopter and flying pre-planned flight trajectories over Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards to simulate the rover's descent stage carrying the rover to the surface of Mars. JPL engineers needed to verify that the radar will provide accurate altitude and velocity measurements at Mars and that the suspended rover will not confuse the ability of the descent stage's radar to accurately calculate the rover's descent speed for a safe, on-target landing. \"Dryden offers a unique location to perform testing of this kind,\" said Carrie Rhoades, the Dryden flight operations engineer managing the MSL project at Dryden. \"We have restricted airspace and a large dry lakebed that is useful in simulating several Mars-like features. Dryden is also conveniently close to JPL, so troubleshooting the system and fixing any issues has been relatively easy to accomplish,\" she said. The helicopter, carrying the MSL radar on a special nose-mounted gimbal system, mimicked the MSL's descent stage on which the radar will be mounted during the mission to Mars. The unique, rocket-powered descent stage will lower the rover, named Curiosity, on cables directly to the planet's surface in a maneuver dubbed \"skycrane.\" The descent stage will then fly away to a preplanned crash after releasing the cables, leaving Curiosity with its wheels on the Martian surface, ready to begin its search for ancient habitats. \"Our JPL team is thrilled to have accomplished this critical radar field test at Dryden,\" said Steven Lee, MSL's Guidance, Navigation, and Control Systems manager. \"The large, flat expanse of Rogers Dry Lake provided an ideal venue for our initial tests. The Dryden team did a great job accommodating our logistical and flight support needs, from hangar space to flight clearances. \"Preliminary results indicate the radar performs as expected and we look forward to continuing our field tests at other Mars-like sites including Amboy Crater, Cadiz Sand Dunes, and Death Valley,\" Lee added. The new skycrane landing method was chosen for the next Mars mission because Curiosity will be the largest rover yet sent to Mars. It's too large for the airbag-cushioned landing method used by NASA's Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997 and the twin Mars Exploration Rover landings in 2004. Also, the MSL mission has a requirement for landing at a more-precise point on Mars than previous rover missions, aiding in the selection of the landing concept. Starting in 2008, Dryden has flown an F/A-18 in a series of MSL developmental flights designed to collect environmental control system data to help validate the MSL radar system. In one flight series, the F/A-18 carried a Quick Test Experimental Pod housing the radar's environmental control hardware to an altitude of 47,000 feet and made a series of dives to simulate a high-speed entry into the Martian atmosphere. More of these flights are scheduled in the coming months to assist JPL in further verifying the MSL radar performance. Mars Science Lab mission components such as Curiosity, the descent stage, the cruise stage and the aeroshell are currently undergoing assembly and testing at JPL in Pasadena, Calif., in preparation for an autumn 2011 launch.

The rover's aeroshell -- the protective covering for the trip to the Red Planet -- and the cruise stage, which will guide it to Mars, arrived at Kennedy last month. The mission is targeted to launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station between Nov. 25 and Dec. 18. The car-size rover will land on Mars in August 2012. \"The design and building part of the mission is nearly behind us now,\" said JPL's David Gruel, who has managed Mars Science Laboratory assembly, test and launch operations since 2007. \"We're getting to final checkouts before sending the rover on its way to Mars.\" The rover and other spacecraft components will undergo more testing before mission staff stack them and fuel the onboard propulsion systems.

NASA's $2.5 billion Mars Science Laboratory mission is slated to launch in late November, and will drop a car-size rover named Curiosity at the Gale crater. \"We are going to the mountain at Gale crater,\" Michael Watkins, project engineer for the Mars Science Laboratory at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., revealed in a press conference today. \"It exhibits three different kinds of environmental settings, perhaps the trilogy of Mars history. It's a worthy goal, a worthy challenge for such a capable rover.\" Gale crater is about 96 miles wide and has a mountain at its center that rises higher, from the crater floor up, than Mount Rainer near Seattle. The crater, which is named after Australian astronomer Walter F. Gale, is so large that the U.S. states of Connecticut and Rhode Island could fit inside it, NASA officials said. \"Mars is firmly in our sights,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement. \"Curiosity not only will return a wealth of important science data, but it will serve as a precursor mission for human exploration to the Red Planet.\" Gale crater is also thought to harbor clues of ancient water activity on the Martian surface, and one of Curiosity's primary tasks will be to root around for evidence that Mars is, or was, capable of supporting microbial life. \"Scientists identified Gale as their top choice to pursue the ambitious goals of this new rover mission,\" said Jim Green, director for the planetary science division at NASA Headquarters in Washington, in a statement. \"The site offers a visually dramatic landscape and also great potential for significant science findings.\" The agency revealed the landing site today in a briefing hosted by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington. The announcement coincides with the museum's celebration of Mars Day, which commemorates the 35th anniversary of NASA's Viking 1 Mars landing on July 20, 1976. The next Mars landing. During a series of worldwide workshops, members of the science community proposed 60 potential landing sites, said John Grant, a geologist at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. In 2008, four primary candidates were selected, and eventually two finalists were identified: Eberswalde crater and Gale crater. Eberswalde is largely considered one of the best deltas on Mars, and at some point, the crater was likely filled with water, Grant said. Each of the candidate sites \"represent an incredible opportunity for MSL. It was a very difficult decision to arrive at a final one,\" he said. Targeted images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the Red Planet since 2006, provided detailed imagery of the potential landing sites that enabled scientists and engineers to evaluate safety concerns and the scientific benefits of each candidate location. A team of senior NASA officials, principal investigators and co-investigators then conducted a thorough review and unanimously selected Gale crater as the official landing site. \"All four of the final sites were really great candidates,\" Grant told SPACE.com. \"Early on in the process, I had a favorite. I can honestly say that that went away. They're really different. With Gale crater, there're still questions about how this mountain of material is in place. All of them have very attractive attributes and some unknowns, so you really have to say, 'Which one offers us the broadest benefits to the objectives of MSL?'\" Meet Mars' Gale crater. In the end, the program scientists found the broadest benefits in Gale crater's diverse environmental settings. \"The Gale site represents an incredibly rich suite of scientific investigations that we can do,\" said Dawn Sumner, a geologist at the University of California, Davis. At the base of the mountain, there are signatures of clays and sulfate salts, which are both known to form in water, and are both key classes of minerals that will reveal clues about the environment on Mars, Sumner said. By moving toward Gale's mountain, the layering will help scientists understand how the Martian environment changed through time. From these observations, project scientists are hoping to glean information about Mars' potential habitability. The Curiosity rover will expand on previous Mars exploration with its sophisticated onboard instruments. The rover's science payload has the potential to identify organic carbon and other ingredients and compounds that make up the building blocks of biology. Scientists are hoping that Curiosity will find minerals in the clay and sulfate-rich layers near the base of Gale crater's mountain. \"Gale gives us attractive possibilities for finding organics, but that is still a long shot,\" said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters. \"What adds to Gale's appeal is that, organics or not, the site holds a diversity of features and layers for investigating changing environmental conditions, some of which could inform a broader understanding of habitability on ancient Mars.\" And while Curiosity's mission does not include life detection, the rover is expected to unearth clues about the habitability of the environments on the Red Planet, said John Grotzinger, MSL project scientist at JPL. \"This is a very, very difficult challenge that we have for us,\" Grotzinger said. \"We hope to be able to be able to look for organic carbon. What we can promise and deliver with MSL is an understanding of the environmental history of Mars.\" NASA revealed the landing site today in a briefing hosted by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

NASA's Curiosity rover will be the largest rover ever sent to Mars. After launching from Florida later this year, the rover will spend several months cruising toward Mars for a planned August 2012 landing. The spacecraft weighs a ton and is roughly comparable in size to a Mini Cooper car. The sophisticated rover is designed to study aspects of the Martian surface in greater detail than ever before, boasting a suite of 10 different science instruments.

Beginning tomorrow, technicians at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida will begin folding up the six-wheeled, nuclear-powered rover to pack it inside its heat shield. Targeted to launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral on the day after Thanksgiving, Curiosity was shown off to the media on Friday inside the clean room where it has been undergoing final tests and preparations for its journey to the planet Mars. The rover, which at 10 feet long has been likened to the size of a Mini Cooper, was in its fully-deployed posture. The next time it will be in the same configuration will be after it is deposited on the surface of Mars in August 2012. \"We're going to start buttoning up the hatches here,\" said Torsten Zorn, a robotics engineer with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Tuck and stow. Over the next three or so days, Zorn and his fellow team members will work to fold down Curiosity's high-gain antenna, which will enable the rover to communicate directly with Earth. Technicians will also lock down the Remote Sensing Mast, which supports Curiosity's two stereo navigation cameras used for driving the rover and two science instruments to investigate the rover's surroundings. They will also fold up Curiosity's instrument-tipped arm, capable of reaching out more than 7 feet to collect and study samples of the Martian surface. Finally, technicians will tuck in Curiosity's six wheels, which are designed to roll the rover over obstacles up to 25 inches high and to travel distances up to 660 feet per day on the Martian terrain. \" We just fold them up, like a little insect,\" Zorn said. Packing for flight. Once all the folding, stowing and tucking is complete, the Curiosity rover will be ready to be mated with its descent stage vehicle and then fitted inside a tightly-packaged cruise stage and aeroshell that will protect the rover on its nine-month trip to Mars. That whole package will then be placed inside a protective shell called a fairing and eventually stacked atop the Atlas 5 rocket. In the days leading up to liftoff, engineers will install Curiosity's nuclear power source: a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, which produces electricity from the heat of plutonium-238's radioactive decay. This long- lived power supply will provide Curiosity with an operating lifespan on Mars' surface of at least a full Mars year. After arriving at Mars, the spacecraft will steer itself through Mars' atmosphere with a series of S-curve maneuvers similar to those used by astronauts piloting NASA's now-retired space shuttles. During the three minutes before touchdown, the spacecraft will slow its plunge to the ground with a parachute, then use retro rockets mounted around the rim of an upper stage to further slow its approach. In the final seconds before Curiosity's landing, the upper stage will act as a sky crane, lowering the upright rover on a tether to the surface. Bigger and better. Curiosity is about twice as long and five times as heavy as NASA's twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which launched in 2003 and are still on the Martian surface. Curiosity inherited many design elements from its earlier, smaller cousins - including six-wheel drive, a \"rocker-bogie\" suspension system and cameras mounted on a mast to help the mission's team on Earth select exploration targets and driving routes. However, unlike Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity has equipment to gather samples of rocks and soil, process them and distribute them to onboard test chambers that are inside analytical instruments. Those instruments include some of the most advanced scientific gear ever used on Mars' surface and a payload more than 10 times as massive as those of the earlier Mars rovers. Using these tools, Curiosity will investigate whether conditions on Mars may be favorable for microbial life today and for preserving clues in the rocks about possible past life.

The Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, or MMRTG, moved from a preparation building to the Atlas 5 rocket's Vertical Integration Facility early Thursday. The 99-pound device was lifted inside the building and inserted through an access door on the rocket's bulbous white payload fairing. Technicians placed the power source on Curiosity through an opening on the spacecraft's backshell, which encloses the rover and its landing system during the journey from Earth to Mars. It's a simple connection, according to David Gruel, manager of the mission's assembly, test and launch operations phase. \"We have four bolts holding it on and we hook up the electrical connections,\" Gruel said. Once the MMRTG is all hooked up, the spacecraft will begin receiving its own power. The final power-up is scheduled for Friday morning, and it won't be turned off again. \"It's really cool that when the vehicle is powered on Friday with the RTG that it's basically going to stay powered all the way through the mission,\" Gruel said. The attachment of the power source is one of the last steps to prepare the $2.5 billion Mars Science Laboratory mission for launch. The 197-foot-tall Atlas 5 rocket will roll to the launch pad Nov. 23 in advance of liftoff Nov. 25 at 10:25 a.m. EST. Curiosity will streak into the Martian atmosphere, descend under parachute and touch down with an unflown \"sky crane\" architecture using a rocket pack and bridle to gently lower the rover to the surface. Landing at Gale crater is scheduled for August 2012. The mission will seek evidence whether Mars was once habitable for life. The MMRTG is the final piece to go on the spacecraft because of the hazards with the radioactive power system. But the unit is built with layers of protective shielding to contain the MMRTG's plutonium fuel through impacts, explosions and an unplanned re-entry back into the atmosphere. There's no threat of an atomic detonation from the Pu-238 aboard the Curiosity rover. Steve Brisbin, Kennedy Space Center's associate director for center operations, said there is about a 1-in-400 chance of radioactive material being released in a launch accident. Even if plutonium does leak into the atmosphere, the health risk is low. \"There would not be expected to be any health effect from a mishap from the launch of the Mars Science Laboratory,\" Brisbin said, adding someone exposed to released plutonium during launch would only see a small fraction of the annual natural dose of radiation from solar and cosmic rays. The Mars mission's plutonium generator consists of a nuclear battery that converts decay heat into electricity. It contains 10.6 pounds of radioactive plutonium-238 and solid-state thermocouples that convert the plutonium's heat energy into electricity, according to NASA. The MMRTG is provided by the Energy Department, which is responsible for procuring, storying and supplying nuclear material to users like NASA. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp. built the device. Nuclear generators have powered 26 U.S. space missions over the last five decades, enabling exploration of the sun, the moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. NASA's New Horizons probe, another nuclear-powered mission, is traveling toward Pluto for an encounter in 2015. The Curiosity rover's MMRTG is a new generation of power source designed for use on planets with atmospheres like Mars, as well as in the vacuum of space. It also operates at power intervals of 110 watts, a smaller increment than previous RTGs. It measures about 25 inches in diameter and 26 inches long, according to a NASA fact sheet. The Mars rover's generator will produce power over at least 14 years. The rover's baseline mission is expected to last approximately two years on the surface of Mars. The MMRTG's Pu-238 fuel is a non-weapons-grade isotope of plutonium, but U.S. stockpiles of the material are dwindling, alarming scientists planning missions to the outer solar system. There's currently not enough Pu-238 in the Energy Department's stores to supply a flagship probe to study Jupiter's moon Europa in the 2020s. The Energy Department does not disclose how much Pu-238 is left in its inventory, but a National Research Council decadal survey report issued earlier this year estimated 16.8 kilograms, or about 37 pounds, of the isotope were left over after the Mars Science Laboratory. NASA projected in 2010 it needs more than double that amount of Pu-238 through 2027, necessitating purchases from Russia and renewed production in the United States. Russia, which also no longer produces Pu-238, is demanding a more lucrative contract for the U.S. government to buy its plutonium. Efforts to restart Pu-238 production in the United States have met resistance in Congress. It would cost between $75 million and $90 million to reach full capacity in five or six years, according to the Energy Department. The Energy Department is sponsoring development of a more efficient nuclear generator that could fly in space as soon as 2016. The Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators require less Pu-238 to produce electricity, but they are more complicated and contain tiny pistons that could be prone to failure. Traditional RTGs have no moving parts, increasing their reliability.

Such radiation is potentially hazardous to humans, so the rover's results could help scientists plan future manned missions to Mars, researchers said. \"RAD is serving as a proxy for an astronaut inside a spacecraft on the way to Mars,\" Don Hassler, RAD's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., said in a statement. \"The instrument is deep inside the spacecraft, the way an astronaut would be. Understanding the effects of the spacecraft on the radiation field will be valuable in designing craft for astronauts to travel to Mars .\" Measuring radiation on Mars. Curiosity, the centerpiece of NASA's $2.5 billion Mars Science Laboratory mission, launched on Nov. 26 and is due to touch down at the Red Planet's Gale Crater in early August 2012.

Most of Curiosity's 10 different science instruments are built to help the rover answer this question. RAD will also help assess Martian habitability. However, the toaster-size instrument was designed specifically to prepare for future human exploration of Mars. Its measurements will help scientists calculate the radiation dose astronauts would receive on the surface of the Red Planet, researchers said. But future Martian explorers would also be exposed to radiation during their long journey to the Red Planet, so mission scientists have turned RAD on in deep space. Measuring space radiation. Scientists have measured space radiation before, but previous observations were made with instruments at or near the surface of spacecraft, researchers said. But RAD is on Curiosity's body, buried inside the MSL spacecraft. It's therefore shielded by various components, including the mission's protective aeroshell. So RAD's measurements should be a closer approximation of the doses astronauts would receive on their trek to Mars, researchers said. The RAD observations mark the beginning of Curiosity's science work, which will really take off when the rover lands on Mars next August. \"While Curiosity will not look for signs of life on Mars, what it might find could be a game-changer about the origin and evolution of life on Earth and elsewhere in the universe,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. \"One thing is certain: The rover's discoveries will provide critical data that will impact human and robotic planning and research for decades.\" As of Wednesday morning, Curiosity had covered about 31.9 million miles on its 352-million-mile flight to Mars.

The six-wheeled robot carries a nuclear power source and 10 science instruments - including a rock- zapping laser - to perform the mission. Wednesday's course change was required because NASA intentionally launched Curiosity away from Mars at the mission's start in order to avoid any chance that parts of the spacecraft's Atlas 5 rocket could hit the Red Planet and contaminate the Martian surface. \"We do that on all of our missions to Mars to protect the planetary environment there,\" Amador said. To put the rover back on track, mission managers commanded Curiosity to fire its eight rocket thrusters to change the spacecraft's velocity by about 12.3 mph. The change places Curiosity on a path that will approach 25,000 miles closer to Mars than before, and about 14 hours earlier than the previous course. \"The timing of the encounter is important for arriving at Mars just when the planet's rotation puts Gale Crater in the right place,\" said JPL's Tomas Martin-Mur, chief navigator for the mission, in a statement.

NASA's huge Curiosity rover is hurtling toward a planned late-night landing on Mars on Aug. 5 PDT, and the anticipation on the science team is high. The reasons are clear: At 1 ton, Curiosity is the largest rover ever aimed at Mars. It will land in a completely new way, using a giant parachute and a rocket-powered sky crane. And it is carrying a sophisticated set of tools to find out if its Martian drop zone could once have been home for life. But that's all in the future. First Curiosity has to reach Mars in one piece. \"I think people are kind of waiting,\" Richard Cook, the rover's deputy project manager, told SPACE.com. \"It's a little bit like waiting for a final. You're patiently counting down the days.\" NASA launched the $2.5 billion rover in November 2011 in a bid to explore Mars as never before. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., is overseeing the mission. Curiosity is a six-wheeled robot the size of a Mini Cooper car. As the centerpiece of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission, it has a nuclear power source to keep it running for a full Martian year and 10 primary science instruments to study the Red Planet's surface, atmosphere and past habitability. \"It's just more complicated in kind of every way\" than past Mars landers, Cook says. That includes the rover Opportunity, which is still active on the Red Planet. Nail-biting landing plan. Curiosity will drop into the huge Gale crater, a 96-mile wide indentation with a central mountain rising 3 miles into the Martian sky. If all goes well, the rover's entry capsule will plunge into the Martian atmosphere at 13,200 mph, with a heat shield protecting it from the searing temperatures of entry. At 7 miles up, it will unfurl the largest parachute ever sent to another world to start slowing down. Then the descent stage should kick in, firing eight rocket engines to slow the spacecraft down even more. At a height of 66 feet, the sky crane maneuver will lower Curiosity on cables. Only then, 12 seconds before touchdown, will the rover's wheels pop into place so it can be lowered the rest of the way to the Gale crater floor. Once sensors show Curiosity is firmly on Mars, the rocket sky crane will sever its connecting cables and fly off to crash a safe distance away. The entire landing procedure is to take seven minutes. NASA calls it \" seven minutes of terror .\" Cook said Curiosity has been tested time and time again to make sure everything is as ready as it can be for landing. The team, he said, is \"cautiously optimistic\" of a smooth touchdown. Final approach to Mars. That's not to say NASA's Mars Science Laboratory team can only sit and hope for success. Mission planners have been steadily preparing for Curiosity's novel landing and its first days on Mars. Mars Rover Curiosity: 11 Amazing Facts Last week, mission managers ordered Curiosity's cruise stage to fire its thrusters in a maneuver designed to fine-tune the rover's approach to Gale crater. The maneuver shifts Curiosity's entry point into the Mars atmosphere by 125 miles and has moved the scheduled entry up by 70 seconds. \"This puts us closer to our entry target, so if any further maneuvers are needed, I expect them to be small,\" said Tomas Martin-Mur, Curiosity's navigation team chief at JPL, in a June 26 statement. Next week Curiosity's landing mission team will assemble at JPL for a weeklong simulation of the approach and landing. The simulation will last four days: the two days leading up to the mock Mars touchdown and the two that follow. \"It is our big dress rehearsal,\" Cook said. Most of the landing sequence for Curiosity is ultimately automated, so \"the thing that we're really testing here is really the people.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/16465-mars-rover-curiosity-red-planet-landing.html"}, {"title": "Curiosity Rover Just Hours from Mars Landing", "date": "2012-08-05", "content": "NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is healthy and right on course for a landing in several hours that will be one of the most difficult feats of robotic exploration ever attempted. Emotions are strong in the control room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., as the hours and miles race toward touchdown of the car-size Curiosity at about 10:31 p.m. PDT tonight. \"Excitement is building while the team is diligently monitoring the spacecraft,\" said Mission Manager Brian Portock of JPL. \"It's natural to get anxious before a big event, but we believe we are very well prepared.\" Descent from the top of Mars' atmosphere to the surface will employ bold techniques enabling use of a smaller target area and heavier landed payload than were possible for any previous Mars mission. These innovations, if successful, will place a well-equipped mobile laboratory into a locale especially well-suited for this mission of discovery. The same innovations advance NASA toward capabilities needed for human missions to Mars. Controllers decided Sunday morning to forgo the sixth and last opportunity on the mission calendar for a course-correction maneuver. The spacecraft is headed for its target entry point at the top of Mars' atmosphere precisely enough without that maneuver. Later today, mission controllers will choose whether or not to use a last opportunity for updating onboard information the spacecraft will use during its autonomous control of the entry, descent and landing. Parameters on a motion tracker were adjusted Saturday for fine-tuning determination of the spacecraft's orientation during the descent. At the critical moment of Curiosity's touchdown, controllers and the rest of the world will be relying on NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to provide immediate confirmation of a successful landing. Odyssey will turn to point in the right direction beforehand to listen to Curiosity during the landing. If for any reason that turn maneuver does not work, a successful landing cannot be confirmed until more than two hours later. The landing will end a 36-week flight from Earth and begin at two-year prime mission on Mars. Researchers will use Curiosity's 10 science instruments to investigate whether Martian environmental conditions have ever been favorable for microbial life.

NASA says it received a signal from the Curiosity rover after a plunge through the Martian atmosphere described as \" seven minutes of terror .\" Cheers and applause broke out at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory just after 1:30 a.m. EDT Monday when the first signal came that the rover had landed successfully. \"Touchdown confirmed,\" said engineer Allen Chen. \"We're safe on Mars.\" Minutes later, Curiosity beamed back the first pictures from the surface showing its wheel and its shadow, cast by the afternoon sun - giving earthlings their first glimpse of the very alien place where the rover now stands. \"Tonight's success, delivered by NASA, parallels our major steps forward towards a vision for a new partnership with American companies to send American astronauts into space on American spacecraft,\" President Obama said in a statement. \"And tonight's success reminds us that our preeminence -- not just in space, but here on Earth -- depends on continuing to invest wisely in the innovation, technology, and basic research that has always made our economy the envy of the world.\" NASA Associate Administrator John Grunsfeld told ABC News Curiosity's instruments were working well. The first images were in black and white, shot by low-resolution navigation cameras on the rover's chassis, meant to show the ship's location and condition, but Grunsfeld said there was a lovely pebble field in front of the rover. Mars Curiosity is NASA's latest and boldest attempt yet to go where robots -- but no man -- have gone before. Before this mission, the U.S., Russia, Japan and Europe had sent 40 spacecraft to explore the fourth planet from the sun since the space age began. Twenty- six had failed. Curiosity, an intrepid chemistry set on wheels, packed with cameras and gadgets galore, was designed to look for signs that life once existed on Mars. Not Marvin the Martian, but signs that Mars could once have had the chemical resources needed to support microbial life. This could mean potential sources of water, food and energy that could someday support visiting humans from Earth. The landing was famously dubbed \"Seven Minutes of Terror\" by the engineers who figured out the best way to land. Adam Steltzner, team leader for the entry, descent and landing of Curiosity, said that as the ship was in the planning stages and then heading to Mars, he found himself waking up in the middle of the night, thinking about the sequence of events that would have to go perfectly. \"The big trick is you are going 13,000 miles an hour,\" he said. \"You slam into the Martian atmosphere and you want to gracefully get the spacecraft down sitting quietly on the surface on her wheels, and all of that takes different changes in the configuration of the vehicle, 79 events that must occur.\" Curiosity landed when Mars was 154 million miles from Earth. It weighed 5,293 pounds on Earth -- the size of a small car and much, much bigger than the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which were cushioned by airbags when they landed in 2004. Engineers quickly figured out that airbags would burst if they were tried on Curiosity. So they designed it to be lowered to the Martian surface by a heat shield, then a parachute, then retro-rockets, and finally a sky crane -- something that had never tried before -- and that's what made this so scary for them. Just one slip would have meant $2.5 billion down the drain. Curiosity launched on Thanksgiving weekend 2011 and traveled 354 million miles in eight months. Its target: Gale Crater, a site where many layers of Martian bedrock are believed to be exposed. The landing happened in an area that would be facing away from Earth as the planet turned. The spacecraft was equipped with an X-band transmitter to let the rover communicate directly with Earth, but its first attempt to phone home was relayed by an older U.S. probe in orbit around Mars. Curiosity is designed to roam the planet for one Martian year, which is 22 months on Earth. Spirit and Opportunity -- NASA deliberately played down expectations -- were only expected to run for 90 Martian \"sols,\" or days on Mars, but Spirit kept on going until 2010 and Opportunity is still puttering around on Mars. The U.S. has had its share of failures getting to Mars, but it has done better than other countries. Russia has the most dismal record: it launched 19 missions and 19 failed. You have to give them credit for trying. Phobos Grunt, a mission to return a small soil sample from one of Mars' tiny moons, ended in spectacular fashion last fall, unable even to leave Earth orbit. India just announced it would fund its first mission to Mars to launch next year. Why do this? Aswin Vasavada, a project scientist for Mars Curiosity, said there is an elemental drive in humans. \"We are humans, we want to explore,\" he said. \"We see a mountain, and we want to climb it. As scientists we want to answer the big questions.\" ", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/mars-curiosity-rover-lands-successfully-mars/story?id=16934302"}, {"title": "NASA's rover Curiosity lands safely on Mars", "date": "2012-08-07", "content": "NASA's Mars science rover Curiosity performed a daredevil descent through pink Martian skies yesterday to clinch a historic landing inside an ancient crater and begin a search for signs the red planet may have once harbored key ingredients for life. Mission controllers burst into applause and cheers as they received signals confirming the car-sized rover had survived a perilous seven-minute descent, which NASA called the most elaborate and difficult feat in the annals of robotic spaceflight. Celebrations by the mission team were so joyous the director of the space program Charles Elachi had to plead for calm in order to hold a press conference. He compared the group to athletic teams that go to the Olympics. \"This team came back with the gold,\" Reuters quoted him as saying. Engineers said the tricky landing sequence, which combined a giant parachute with a rocket-pack that lowered the rover to the Martian surface on a tether, allowed for no margin of error. Eight-month-long journey. The $2.5 billion Curiosity project, formally called the Mars Science Laboratory, is NASA's first astrobiology mission since the 1970s-era Viking probes. Obama himself issued a statement hailing the Curiosity landing as \"an unprecedented feat of technology that will stand as a point of national pride far into the future.\" NASA plans to put the one-ton, six-wheeled, nuclear-powered rover and its sophisticated instruments through several weeks of engineering checks before starting its two-year surface mission in earnest. Launched on Nov. 26 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the robotic lab sailed through space for more than eight months, covering 566 million kilometers, before piercing Mars' thin atmosphere at 20,921 kilometers per hour, 17 times the speed of sound, to start its descent. Curiosity is designed to spend the next two years exploring Gale Crater and an unusual five-kilometer-high mountain consisting of what appears to be sediment rising from the crater's floor. Over the next several days, Curiosity is expected to send back the first color pictures. After several weeks of health checkups, the six-wheeled rover could take its first short drive and flex its robotic arm, according to The Associated Press. Its primary mission is to look for evidence that Mars may have once hosted the basic building blocks necessary for microbial life to evolve. The rover comes equipped with an array of sophisticated instruments capable of analyzing samples of soil, rocks and atmosphere on the spot and beaming the results back to Earth. Mission controllers were joined by 1,400 scientists, engineers and dignitaries who tensely waited to learn of Curiosity's fate, among them film star Morgan Freeman.

The rover's \"brain transplant,\" which will occur during a series of steps Aug. 10 through Aug. 13, will install a new version of software on both of the rover's redundant main computers. This software for Mars surface operations was uploaded to the rover's memory during the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's flight from Earth. \"We designed the mission from the start to be able to upgrade the software as needed for different phases of the mission,\" said Ben Cichy of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., chief software engineer for the Mars Science Laboratory mission. \"The flight software version Curiosity currently is using was really focused on landing the vehicle. It includes many capabilities we just don't need any more. It gives us basic capabilities for operating the rover on the surface, but we have planned all along to switch over after landing to a version of flight software that is really optimized for surface operations.\" A key capability in the new version is image processing to check for obstacles. This allows for longer drives by giving the rover more autonomy to identify and avoid potential hazards and drive along a safe path the rover identifies for itself. Other new capabilities facilitate use of the tools at the end of the rover's robotic arm. While Curiosity is completing the software transition, the mission's science team is continuing to analyze images the rover has taken of its surroundings inside Gale Crater. Researchers are discussing which features in the scene to investigate after a few weeks of initial checkouts and observations to assess equipment on the rover and characteristics of the landing site. The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft delivered Curiosity to its target area on Mars at 10:31:45 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5, which includes the 13.8 minutes needed for confirmation of the touchdown to be radioed to Earth at the speed of light. Curiosity carries 10 science instruments with a total mass 15 times as large as the science payloads on NASA's Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. Some of the tools, such as a laser-firing instrument for checking rocks' elemental composition from a distance, are the first of their kind on Mars. Curiosity will use a drill and scoop, which are located at the end of its robotic arm, to gather soil and powdered samples of rock interiors, then sieve and parcel out these samples into the rover's analytical laboratory instruments. To handle this science toolkit, Curiosity is twice as long and five times as heavy as Spirit or Opportunity. The Gale Crater landing site at 4.59 degrees south, 137.44 degrees east, places the rover within driving distance of layers of the crater's interior mountain. Observations from orbit have identified clay and sulfate minerals in the lower layers, indicating a wet history. Mars Science Laboratory is a project of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

Curiosity snapped the high-resolution self-portrait with its navigation cameras on the night of Aug. 7, just two days after it touched down inside Mars' huge Gale Crater. NASA released the image - which is composed of 20 full-frame navcam shots - during a press conference Friday. \"What's really exciting about this is that we see the rover - a self-portrait, with the rim of Gale Crater in the background,\" said Curiosity chief scientist John Grotzinger, a geologist at Caltech in Pasadena. The back of the rover is at the image's left. Two of Curiosity's three right- side wheels are visible, as are a smattering of small rocks kicked up onto the rover's deck by its rocket-powered sky crane, which lowered Curiosity to the surface on cables. Curiosity, the centerpiece of NASA's $2.5 billion Mars Science Laboratory mission, aims to determine if the Gale Crater area is, or ever was, capable of supporting microbial life. The rover will spend the next two years or more studying rocks and soil in the 96-mile-wide crater with its 10 different science instruments. Curiosity's main science target is Mount Sharp, the 3.4-mile-high mountain rising from Gale's center. Mars-orbiting spacecraft have spotted evidence of clays and sulfates near Mount Sharp's base, suggesting it was exposed to liquid water long ago. The rover likely won't begin driving toward Mount Sharp for several months. Mission scientists are still checking out the rover and its instruments, making sure everything is in good working order on the Martian surface. They've found no major problems yet, scientists have said. Researchers announced today that Curiosity's first big drive will be to a site called Glenelg, which sits about 1,300 feet east of Curiosity's landing site. Glenelg is not on the way to Mount Sharp, but it hosts three different types of terrain for the rover to check out, all in one spot. Curiosity has yet to turn its wheels on the Red Planet's surface, but that should change soon. Mission team members have said they're aiming to take Curiosity on its first short drive next week sometime, possibly as early as Monday or Tuesday. If everything goes well, Curiosity could begin the trek to Glenelg shortly thereafter. The rover may be ready to head for Mount Sharp sometime toward the end of the year, Grotzinger said.

Careful inspection of the tracks reveals a unique, repeating pattern, which the rover can use as a visual reference to drive more accurately in barren terrain. The pattern is Morse code for JPL, the abbreviation for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., where the rover was designed and built, and the mission is managed. \"The purpose of the pattern is to create features in the terrain that can be used to visually measure the precise distance between drives,\" said Matt Heverly, the lead rover driver for Curiosity at JPL. This driving tool, called visual odometry, allows the rover to use images of landscape features to determine if it has traveled as far as predicted, or if its wheels have slipped. For example, when the rover drives on high slopes or across loose soil, it will routinely stop to check its progress. By measuring its distance relative to dozens of prominent features like pebbles or shadows on rocks -- or patterns in its tracks -- the rover can check how much its wheels may have slipped. If Curiosity has not slipped too much, it can then re-plan the next leg of its drive, taking its actual position into account. \"Visual odometry will enable Curiosity to drive more accurately even in high- slip terrains, aiding its science mission by reaching interesting targets in fewer sols, running slip checks to stop before getting too stuck, and enabling precise driving,\" said rover driver Mark Maimone, who led the development of the rover's autonomous driving software. The Morse code imprinted on all six wheels will be particularly handy when the terrain is barren. Curiosity won't be able to read the Morse code symbols in the track marks directly, but it will note that the pattern is a high-contrast feature. This will give the rover the anchor it needs in an otherwise featureless terrain. \"Imagine standing in front of a picket fence, and then closing your eyes and shifting to the side. When you open your eyes, you wouldn't be able to tell how many pickets you passed. If you had one picket that was a different shape though, you could always use that picket as your reference,\" said Heverly. \"With Curiosity, it's a similar problem in featureless terrain like sand dunes. The hole pattern in the wheels gives us one 'big picket' to look at.\" NASA's Mars Exploration rovers Spirit and Opportunity also used visual odometry to ensure accurate driving in difficult terrains. Their wheels had been bolted to their landing platform, leaving holes that left distinguishing marks in their tracks. Those marks proved critical for the visual odometry system on Opportunity when it traversed the relatively featureless terrain at Meridian Planum. Opportunity is still trekking on Mars more than eight years after setting down on the Red Planet. Curiosity likewise has holes in its wheels, only in the shape of Morse code letters. \"Even though Curiosity didn't need to be bolted down, we wanted to have the holes anyway. The mechanical team suggested multiple smaller holes rather than one large one like the Mars Exploration Rovers had, and one earlier design had spelled out letters in a cleat pattern, so I proposed using a Morse code version,\" said Maimone. \"And the rest is history.\" ", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20120829f.html"}, {"title": "Mars Rover Curiosity Arm Tests Nearly Complete", "date": "2012-09-12", "content": "NASA's Mars Curiosity team has almost finished robotic arm tests in preparation for the rover to touch and examine its first Martian rock. Tests with the 7-foot arm have allowed the mission team to gain confidence in the arm's precise maneuvering in Martian temperature and gravity conditions. During these activities, Curiosity has remained at a site it reached by its most recent drive on Sept. 5. The team will resume driving the rover this week and use its cameras to seek the first rock to touch with instruments on the arm. \"We're about to drive some more and try to find the right rock to begin doing contact science with the arm,\" said Jennifer Trosper, Curiosity mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Two science instruments -- a camera called Mars Hand Lens Imager that can take close-up, color images and a tool called Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer that determines the elemental composition of a target rock -- have passed preparatory tests at the rover's current location. The instruments are mounted on a turret at the end of the arm and can be placed in contact with target rocks. Curiosity's Canadian-made APXS had taken atmospheric readings earlier, but its first use on a solid target on Mars was this week on a calibration target brought from Earth. X-ray detectors work best cold, but even the daytime APXS tests produced clean data for identifying elements in the target. \"The spectrum peaks are so narrow, we're getting excellent resolution, just as good as we saw in tests on Earth under ideal conditions,\" said APXS principal investigator Ralf Gellert of the University of Guelph, in Ontario, Canada. \"The good news is that we can now make high-resolution measurements even at high noon to support quick decisions about whether a sample is worthwhile for further investigations.\" The adjustable-focus MAHLI camera this week has produced sharp images of objects near and far. \"Honestly, seeing those images with Curiosity's wheels in the foreground and Mount Sharp in the background simply makes me cry,\" said MAHLI principal investigator Ken Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego. \"I know we're just getting started, but it's already been an incredible journey.\" MAHLI is also aiding evaluation of the arm's ability to position its tools and instruments. Curiosity moved the arm to predetermined \"teach points\" on Sept. 11, including points above each of three inlet ports where it will later drop samples of soil and powdered rock into analytical instruments inside the rover. Images from the MAHLI camera confirmed the placements. Photos taken before and after opening the inlet cover for the chemistry and mineralogy analytical instrument also confirmed good operation of the cover. \"Seeing that inlet cover open heightens our anticipation of getting the first solid sample into CheMin in the coming weeks,\" said CheMin principal investigator David Blake of NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. A test last week that checked X-rays passing through an empty sample cell in CheMin worked well. It confirmed the instrument beneath the inlet opening is ready to start analyzing soil and rock samples. Curiosity is five weeks into a 2-year prime mission on Mars.

There is earlier evidence for the presence of water on Mars, but this evidence -- images of rocks containing ancient streambed gravels -- is the first of its kind. Scientists are studying the images of stones cemented into a layer of conglomerate rock. The sizes and shapes of stones offer clues to the speed and distance of a long-ago stream's flow. \"From the size of gravels it carried, we can interpret the water was moving about 3 feet per second, with a depth somewhere between ankle and hip deep,\" said Curiosity science co-investigator William Dietrich of the University of California, Berkeley. \"Plenty of papers have been written about channels on Mars with many different hypotheses about the flows in them. This is the first time we're actually seeing water-transported gravel on Mars. This is a transition from speculation about the size of streambed material to direct observation of it.\" The finding site lies between the north rim of Gale Crater and the base of Mount Sharp, a mountain inside the crater. Earlier imaging of the region from Mars orbit allows for additional interpretation of the gravel-bearing conglomerate. The imagery shows an alluvial fan of material washed down from the rim, streaked by many apparent channels, sitting uphill of the new finds. The rounded shape of some stones in the conglomerate indicates long-distance transport from above the rim, where a channel named Peace Vallis feeds into the alluvial fan. The abundance of channels in the fan between the rim and conglomerate suggests flows continued or repeated over a long time, not just once or for a few years. The discovery comes from examining two outcrops, called \"Hottah\" and \"Link,\" with the telephoto capability of Curiosity's mast camera during the first 40 days after landing. Those observations followed up on earlier hints from another outcrop, which was exposed by thruster exhaust as Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory Project's rover, touched down. \"Hottah looks like someone jack-hammered up a slab of city sidewalk, but it's really a tilted block of an ancient streambed,\" said Mars Science Laboratory Project Scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The gravels in conglomerates at both outcrops range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. Some are angular, but many are rounded. \"The shapes tell you they were transported and the sizes tell you they couldn't be transported by wind. They were transported by water flow,\" said Curiosity science co-investigator Rebecca Williams of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz. The science team may use Curiosity to learn the elemental composition of the material, which holds the conglomerate together, revealing more characteristics of the wet environment that formed these deposits. The stones in the conglomerate provide a sampling from above the crater rim, so the team may also examine several of them to learn about broader regional geology. The slope of Mount Sharp in Gale Crater remains the rover's main destination. Clay and sulfate minerals detected there from orbit can be good preservers of carbon-based organic chemicals that are potential ingredients for life. \"A long-flowing stream can be a habitable environment,\" said Grotzinger. \"It is not our top choice as an environment for preservation of organics, though. We're still going to Mount Sharp, but this is insurance that we have already found our first potentially habitable environment.\" During the two-year prime mission of the Mars Science Laboratory, researchers will use Curiosity's 10 instruments to investigate whether areas in Gale Crater have ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.

Curiosity is the centerpiece of the two-year Mars Science Laboratory mission. The rover's ability to put soil samples into analytical instruments is central to assessing whether its present location on Mars, called Gale Crater, ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. Mineral analysis can reveal past environmental conditions. Chemical analysis can check for ingredients necessary for life. \"We now have reached an important phase that will get the first solid samples into the analytical instruments in about two weeks,\" said Mission Manager Michael Watkins of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Curiosity has been so well-behaved that we have made great progress during the first two months of the mission.\" The rover's preparatory operations will involve testing its robotic scooping capabilities to collect and process soil samples. Later, it also will use a hammering drill to collect powdered samples from rocks. To begin preparations for a first scoop, the rover used one of its wheels Wednesday to scuff the soil to expose fresh material. Next, the rover twice will scoop up some soil, shake it thoroughly inside the sample-processing chambers to scrub the internal surfaces, then discard the sample. Curiosity will scoop and shake a third measure of soil and place it in an observation tray for inspection by cameras mounted on the rover's mast. A portion of the third sample will be delivered to the mineral-identifying chemistry and mineralogy instrument inside the rover. From a fourth scoopful, samples will be delivered to both CheMin and to the sample analysis at Mars instrument, which identifies chemical ingredients. \"We're going to take a close look at the particle size distribution in the soil here to be sure it's what we want,\" said Daniel Limonadi of JPL, lead systems engineer for Curiosity's surface sampling and science system. \"We are being very careful with this first time using the scoop on Mars.\" The rinse-and-discard cycles serve a quality-assurance purpose similar to a common practice in geochemical laboratory analysis on Earth. \"It is standard to run a split of your sample through first and dump it out, to clean out any residue from a previous sample,\" said JPL's Joel Hurowitz, a sampling system scientist on the Curiosity team. \"We want to be sure the first sample we analyze is unambiguously Martian, so we take these steps to remove any residual material from Earth that might be on the walls of our sample handling system.\" Rocknest is the name of the area of soil Curiosity will test and analyze. The rover pulled up to the windblown, sandy and dusty location Oct. 2. The Rocknest patch is about 8 feet by 16 feet. The area provides plenty of area for scooping several times. Diverse rocks nearby provide targets for investigation with the instruments on Curiosity's mast during the weeks the rover is stationed at Rocknest for this first scooping campaign. Curiosity's motorized, clamshell-shaped scoop is 1.8 inches wide, 2.8 inches long, and can sample to a depth of about 1.4 inches. It is part of the collection and handling Martian rock analysis device on a turret of tools at the end of the rover's arm.

Curiosity scooped its first Mars sample using its robotic arm Sunday and used onboard cameras to snap photos of the event. It was in those images that rover team members spotted the unexpectedly bright object, which could be a sliver of Curiosity, itself. \"Subsequently, the rover team decided to refrain from using the rover's robotic arm on Oct. 8 due to the detection of a bright object on the ground that might be a piece from the rover,\" NASA officials said in an update. Meanwhile, \"Curiosity is acquiring additional imaging of the object to aid the team in identifying the object and assessing possible impact, if any, to sampling activities,\" they added. Curiosity's Mars sample-scooping system is located at the end of its 7-foot robotic arm and is designed to carry the samples into two instruments on the rover's main body. The instruments, called the Sample Analysis at Mars and Chemistry and Mineralogy, are two of the rover's core science tools to determine if Mars could ever have supported microbial life. The first Mars sample tests by Curiosity are meant to prepare the SAM and CheMin instruments for actual science measurements to be performed later. The first scoops of material will help clean the instruments of any \"Earth residue\" left over from the rover's assembly, ensuring that actual science measurements record only the attributes of the Mars samples, mission scientists have said.

The $2.5 billion Curiosity rover ingested the minuscule sample - which contains about as much material as a baby aspirin - on Wednesday. The soil has been successfully delivered to the rover's Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument, or CheMin, mission scientists announced today. \"We are crossing a significant threshold for this mission by using CheMin on its first sample,\" Curiosity lead scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said in a statement. \"This instrument gives us a more definitive mineral-identifying method than ever before used on Mars: X-ray diffraction,\" Grotzinger added. \"Confidently identifying minerals is important because minerals record the environmental conditions under which they form.\" Bright stuff on Mars. The sample that found its way into CheMin came from the third scoop of soil Curiosity dug up at a site dubbed \"Rocknest.\" The first scoop was discarded after being used to scrub out the rover's sampling system, to help ensure that no Earth-originating residues remained. Work at Rocknest slowed after Curiosity dug its second scoop on Oct. 12, when researchers noticed oddly bright flecks at the bottom of the hole. The team dumped the scoop out, worried that it might contain debris that had flaked off Curiosity. They already knew that some tiny rover pieces are littering the Martian ground, after spotting a bright shred of what appears to be plastic on Oct. 7. Team members have since identified five or six other such bits, which may have fallen off Curiosity's sky-crane descent stage during landing on Aug. 5. \"We went super-paranoid,\" Grotzinger told reporters today. The team determined that \"if this stuff is man-made, we better make sure that we're not taking any of it in.\" So Curiosity moved to a slightly different location, and then took lots of pictures to make sure that the surface was pristine before making scoop number three. If any bright flecks are indeed present in the sample, they're naturally occurring, the mission team reasons, since any rover pieces would be restricted to the surface. All that being said, Curiosity scientists now believe the bright soil flecks are indeed indigenous to Mars. They could be minerals that are part of the soil-forming process, Grotzinger said, or reflective surfaces created by the cleaving of ordinary dirt. The team aims to fire its mineral-identifying laser, which is part of Curiosity's ChemCam instrument, at some of the pieces in the next few days to get a better idea of what they actually are. Mars under the microscope. Curiosity carries 10 instruments to help it determine whether its Gale Crater landing site has ever been capable of supporting microbial life. But CheMin and another instrument on the 1-ton rover's body, known as Sample Analysis at Mars, are the rover's core scientific gear. SAM is a chemistry laboratory that can identify organic compounds - the carbon-containing building blocks of life as we know it. The instrument has been sniffing the Martian air already, but it has yet to analyze its first soil sample. That should change in a week or so, Grotzinger said, after further cleaning of the rover's sampling system. Curiosity continues to be in good health, researchers said. After the six- wheeled robot finishes testing out its scooping and sampling systems at Rocknest, mission scientists will begin searching for a spot to break out the rover's rock-boring drill. The first drill activity will be a complicated affair that could take month or so all up, Grotzinger said. Curiosity is currently checking out deposits near a site called \"Glenelg,\" where three interesting types of Martian terrain come together. But its ultimate destination is the base of Mount Sharp, the 3.4-mile-high mountain rising from Gale Crater's center. Mount Sharp's foothills show signs of long-ago exposure to liquid water. Curiosity could be ready to start rolling toward the mountain's interesting deposits - which lie about 6 miles away - in a couple of months. \"I would hope we'd be on our way by the end of the year,\" Grotzinger said.

The minerals were identified in the first sample of Martian soil ingested recently by the rover. Curiosity used its Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument to obtain the results, which are filling gaps and adding confidence to earlier estimates of the mineralogical makeup of the dust and fine soil widespread on the Red Planet. \"We had many previous inferences and discussions about the mineralogy of Martian soil,\" said David Blake of NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., who is the principal investigator for CheMin. \"Our quantitative results provide refined and in some cases new identifications of the minerals in this first X-ray diffraction analysis on Mars.\" The identification of minerals in rocks and soil is crucial for the mission's goal to assess past environmental conditions. Each mineral records the conditions under which it formed. The chemical composition of a rock provides only ambiguous mineralogical information, as in the textbook example of the minerals diamond and graphite, which have the same chemical composition, but strikingly different structures and properties. CheMin uses X-ray diffraction, the standard practice for geologists on Earth using much larger laboratory instruments. This method provides more accurate identifications of minerals than any method previously used on Mars. X-ray diffraction reads minerals' internal structure by recording how their crystals distinctively interact with X-rays. Innovations from Ames led to an X-ray diffraction instrument compact enough to fit inside the rover. These NASA technological advances have resulted in other applications on Earth, including compact and portable X-ray diffraction equipment for oil and gas exploration, analysis of archaeological objects and screening of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, among other uses. \"Our team is elated with these first results from our instrument,\" said Blake. \"They heighten our anticipation for future CheMin analyses in the months and miles ahead for Curiosity.\" The specific sample for CheMin's first analysis was soil Curiosity scooped up at a patch of dust and sand that the team named Rocknest. The sample was processed through a sieve to exclude particles larger than 0.006 inch, roughly the width of a human hair. The sample has at least two components: dust distributed globally in dust storms and fine sand originating more locally. Unlike conglomerate rocks Curiosity investigated a few weeks ago, which are several billion years old and indicative of flowing water, the soil material CheMin has analyzed is more representative of modern processes on Mars. \"Much of Mars is covered with dust, and we had an incomplete understanding of its mineralogy,\" said David Bish, CheMin co-investigator with Indiana University in Bloomington. \"We now know it is mineralogically similar to basaltic material, with significant amounts of feldspar, pyroxene and olivine, which was not unexpected. Roughly half the soil is non-crystalline material, such as volcanic glass or products from weathering of the glass. \" Bish said, \"So far, the materials Curiosity has analyzed are consistent with our initial ideas of the deposits in Gale Crater recording a transition through time from a wet to dry environment. The ancient rocks, such as the conglomerates, suggest flowing water, while the minerals in the younger soil are consistent with limited interaction with water.\" During the two-year prime mission of the Mars Science Laboratory Project, researchers are using Curiosity's 10 instruments to investigate whether areas in Gale Crater ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.

SAM can detect organic compounds - the carbon-containing building blocks of life as we know it - and is thus key to Curiosity's mission, which seeks to determine if Mars has ever been capable of supporting microbial life. SAM ingested its first soil sample on Friday at a sandy site the rover team has dubbed Rocknest. The instrument analyzed the dirt over the following two days using mass spectrometry, gas chromatography and laser spectrometry, researchers said. \"We received good data from this first solid sample,\" SAM principal investigator Paul Mahaffy, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in a statement. \"We have a lot of data analysis to do, and we are planning to get additional samples of Rocknest material to add confidence about what we learn.\" While last Friday's activities kicked off SAM's soil analyses, the instrument had already sniffed the Martian air several times in a search for methane, a gas commonly produced by living organisms here on Earth.

Researchers using the car-sized mobile laboratory have identified transient whirlwinds, mapped winds in relation to slopes, tracked daily and seasonal changes in air pressure, and linked rhythmic changes in radiation to daily atmospheric changes. The knowledge being gained about these processes helps scientists interpret evidence about environmental changes on Mars that might have led to conditions favorable for life. During the first 12 weeks after Curiosity landed in an area named Gale Crater, an international team of researchers analyzed data from more than 20 atmospheric events with at least one characteristic of a whirlwind recorded by the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station instrument. Those characteristics can include a brief dip in air pressure, a change in wind direction, a change in wind speed, a rise in air temperature or a dip in ultraviolet light reaching the rover. Two of the events included all five characteristics. In many regions of Mars, dust-devil tracks and shadows have been seen from orbit, but those visual clues have not been seen in Gale Crater. One possibility is that vortex whirlwinds arise at Gale without lifting as much dust as they do elsewhere. \"Dust in the atmosphere has a major role in shaping the climate on Mars,\" said Manuel de la Torre Juarez of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. He is the investigation scientist for REMS, which Spain provided for the mission. \"The dust lifted by dust devils and dust storms warms the atmosphere.\" Dominant wind direction identified by REMS has surprised some researchers who expected slope effects to produce north-south winds. The rover is just north of a mountain called Mount Sharp. If air movement up and down the mountain's slope governed wind direction, dominant winds generally would be north-south. However, east-west winds appear to predominate. The rim of Gale Crater may be a factor. \"With the crater rim slope to the north and Mount Sharp to the south, we may be seeing more of the wind blowing along the depression in between the two slopes, rather than up and down the slope of Mount Sharp,\" said Claire Newman, a REMS investigator at Ashima Research in Pasadena. \"If we don't see a change in wind patterns as Curiosity heads up the slope of Mount Sharp -- that would be a surprise.\" REMS monitoring of air pressure has tracked both a seasonal increase and a daily rhythm. Neither was unexpected, but the details improve understanding of atmospheric cycles on present-day Mars, which helps with estimating how the cycles may have operated in the past. The seasonal increase results from tons of carbon dioxide, which had been frozen into a southern winter ice cap, returning into the atmosphere as southern spring turns to summer. The daily cycle of higher pressure in the morning and lower pressure in the evening results from daytime heating of the atmosphere by the sun. As morning works its way westward around the planet, so does a wave of heat-expanded atmosphere, known as a thermal tide. Effects of that atmospheric tide show up in data from Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector. This instrument monitors high-energy radiation considered to be a health risk to astronauts and a factor in whether microbes could survive on Mars' surface. \"We see a definite pattern related to the daily thermal tides of the atmosphere,\" said RAD Principal Investigator Don Hassler of the Southwest Research Institute's Boulder, Colo., branch. \"The atmosphere provides a level of shielding, and so charged-particle radiation is less when the atmosphere is thicker. Overall, Mars' atmosphere reduces the radiation dose compared to what we saw during the flight to Mars.\" The overall goal of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission is to use 10 instruments on Curiosity to assess whether areas inside Gale Crater ever offered a habitable environment for microbes.

The Curiosity rover found evidence of chlorine, sulfur and water in Mars dirt studied by its onboard laboratory, as well as organic compounds inside its Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. However, the science team can't yet be sure whether these compounds truly come from Mars, or arise from contamination transported to the Red Planet onboard Curiosity. \"SAM has no definitive detection to report of organic compounds,\" Paul Mahaffy, SAM principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said during a press conference at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. \"Even though Mahaffy's instrument detected organic compounds, first of all we have to determine whether they're indigenous to Mars,\" said John Grotzinger, Curiosity's project scientist. The announcement came after recent rumors - which NASA attempted to dampen last week - that Curiosity had made a huge discovery on Mars. The observation by Curiosity involved perchlorate, a reactive compound of oxygen and chlorine that had previously been found in the Martian arctic by NASA's Phoenix lander. Curiosity's SAM instrument uses a tiny oven to cook Mars dirt samples, then study the gases they give off to determine their chemical makeup. Martian soil samples are placed in the device by a scoop on Curiosity's robotic arm. When Curiosity cooked the perchlorate in its SAM oven, it created chlorinated methane compounds, one-carbon organic material. \"The chlorine is of Martian orgin, but it's possible the carbon may be of Earth origin, carried by Curiosity and detected by SAM's high sensitivity design,\" NASA officials wrote in a statement. The new findings by Curiosity came during the rover's study of a patch of windblown Martian dust and sand called \"Rocknest.\" It is a flat stretch of Mars terrain that is still miles away from Curiosity's first destination, rock outcrop called Glenelg at the base of the 3-mile Mount Sharp that rises from the center of the rover's landing site - the vast Gale Crater. While scientists puzzle out the validity of Curiosity's SAM signals, the rover's other instruments have made curious discoveries, as well, mission scientists said. Curiosity's arm-mounted tools have confirmed that the Martian soil at the Rocknest site is similar in chemical composition and appearance to the dirt seen by NASA's three other rovers: the small Pathfinder, and golf cart-size Spirt and Opportunity rovers. Photos from the rover's Mars hand Lens Imager, or MAHLI, revealed that the sand drifts at Rocknest have a crusty surface that hides even darker, finer sand below. \"Active drifts on Mars look darker on the surface,\" MAHLI principal investigator Ken Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego said in a statement.\"This is an older drift that has had time to be inactive, letting the crust form and dust accumulate on it.\" Meanwhile, Curiosity's Chemical and Mineralogy detector, called CheMin, found that the terrain around Rocknest is a mix of volcanic and glassy, non- crystalline materials. While the rover found more evidence of water than expected, some water molecules bound to bits of sand were anticipated, scientists said.

After the powdered-rock sample is sieved and portioned by a sample-processing mechanism on the rover's arm, it will be analyzed by instruments inside Curiosity. Yellowknife Bay is within a different type of terrain from what the rover has traversed since landing inside Mars' Gale Crater on Aug. 5, PDT.

The Curiosity rover landed Aug. 5 to begin a two-year mission to determine if the Mars may have once been habitable for primitive life. The Dust Removal Tool is a brush that allows Curiosity to sweep away the reddish-brown particles that coat most surfaces on Mars, in order to get a better look at rocks that could be worth drilling into for further study. The motorized brush is made with wire bristles, and is attached to the turret at the end of the rover's robotic arm. The tool, built by New York City-based Honeybee Robotics, resembles brushes that flew to Mars on NASA's previous rover missions, the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. \"This is similar to the brush on board the Rock Abrasion Tools on Spirit and Opportunity, and will let researchers get a look at the rock before deciding whether to drill for a sample,\" Honeybee Robotics spokesman John Abrashkin told SPACE.com.

The target is on flat-lying bedrock within a shallow depression called \"Yellowknife Bay.\" The terrain in this area differs from that of the landing site, a dry streambed about a third of a mile to the west. Curiosity's science team decided to look there for a first drilling target because orbital observations showed fractured ground that cools more slowly each night than nearby terrain types do. \"The orbital signal drew us here, but what we found when we arrived has been a great surprise,\" said Mars Science Laboratory project scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"This area had a different type of wet environment than the streambed where we landed, maybe a few different types of wet environments.\" One line of evidence comes from inspection of light-toned veins with Curiosity's laser-pulsing Chemistry and Camera instrument, which found elevated levels of calcium, sulfur and hydrogen. \"These veins are likely composed of hydrated calcium sulfate, such as bassanite or gypsum,\" said ChemCam team member Nicolas Mangold of the Laboratoire de Plan\u00e9tologie et G\u00e9odynamique de Nantes in France. \"On Earth, forming veins like these requires water circulating in fractures.\" Researchers have used the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager to examine sedimentary rocks in the area.

Curiosity's next step is an overnight pre-load test, which will tell the rover team if the big temperature swings at Curiosity's Gale Crater landing site pose any potential problems for drilling operations. Air temperatures at Gale can drop from 32 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon to minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit at night. The rover's chassis, arm and mobility system can grow and shrink by about 0.1 inches over such a broad temperature range, researchers said. \"We don't plan on leaving the drill in a rock overnight once we start drilling, but in case that happens, it is important to know what to expect in terms of stress on the hardware,\" Limonadi said.

Detailing the composition of rocks is critical to this investigation as the deposits in the crater will retain a geochemical record of the conditions under which they formed. Drilling a few centimetres inside a rock provides a fresh sample that is free from the alteration that can occur at the surface as a result of weathering or radiation damage. Curiosity landed on the Red Planet on 6 August last year. It has since driven east of its touchdown point to a location that satellite images had identified as an intersection of three distinct geological terrains. The robot is currently in a small depression dubbed Yellowknife Bay. The rock selected for the first drilling is a very fine grained sedimentary rock cut through with veins of what appear to be a calcium sulphate. This rock also has a name - John Klein, taken from a recently deceased NASA engineer who worked on the rover project. Scientists are thrilled with the progress of the mission so far. Many of the rocks, like the ones in Yellowknife Bay, show clear evidence of deposition in, or alteration by, water.

The Curiosity rover has not stumbled onto evidence of an ancient civilization that took the family van to Olympus Mons for vacation, however. The object is simply a rock that the wind has sculpted into an interesting shape, scientists said. \"The shiny surface suggests that this rock has a fine grain and is relatively hard,\" Curiosity scientists wrote Monday in an explainer blurb accompanying the image, which was taken on Jan. 30. \"Hard, fine-grained rocks can be polished by the wind to form very smooth surfaces.\" Similar \"ventifacted\" rocks can be found here on Earth, notably on the dry, gusty plains of Antarctica, they added. The newfound rock is not the first shiny object Curiosity has photographed on the Red Planet. In October, the car-size rover paused its first soil-scooping activities to investigate a bright sliver lying on the ground nearby. Scientists think the scrap is a piece of plastic debris that shook loose during the robot's dramatic sky-crane landing on the night of Aug. 5. Later in October, Curiosity spotted bright flecks in one of the holes it dug out while scooping. That material appears to be some sort of native Martian mineral, as does the so-called \" Mars flower ,\" which garnered a lot of attention after Curiosity photographed it in December. While such finds may be be interesting to laypeople and researchers alike, Curiosity has bigger fish to fry. The rover's main task is to determine whether its landing site - a huge crater called Gale - could ever have supported microbial life. Curiosity carries 10 different scientific instruments and 17 cameras to aid in this quest, along with other tools such as a rock-boring drill. Curiosity used this drill to collect samples for the first time over the weekend, boring 2.5 inches into a Red Planet rock in a move that had never been done before on another planet.

Curiosity's first Mars rock samples were placed inside the Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument, as well as the rover's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument during a two-day operation on Friday and Saturday. \"Data from the instruments have confirmed the deliveries,\" said Curiosity Mission Manager Jennifer Trosper of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. The small Mars laboratories are built into the body of the car-size Curiosity rover. They are two of 10 instruments built to determine if Mars is now, or ever has been, capable of supporting microbial life. Curiosity used a percussive drill mounted on its robotic arm to dig into the Mars rock John Klein on Feb. 8, revealing a surprisingly gray-colored interior of the rock. The discovery is intriguing to Mars scientists because it suggests that the rusty reddish-orange color of Mars is only skin deep. The gray-colored rock powder \"may preserve some indication of what iron was doing in these samples without the effect of some later oxidative process that would've rusted the rocks into this orange color that is sort of typical of Mars,\" Joel Hurowitz, sampling system scientist for Curiosity at JPL, told reporters on Wednesday.

Curiosity's handlers put the rover on standby after the sun unleashed a medium-strength flare in the Red Planet's direction Tuesday. It's the second recent shutdown for Curiosity, which had just come out of protective \"safe mode\" Saturday as engineers work through an issue with its primary computer system. \"Storm's a-comin'! There's a solar storm heading for Mars. I'm going back to sleep to weather it out,\" NASA officials wrote on behalf of the rover via Curiosity's Twitter feed today. The rover team views the shutdown as merely a precaution, as Curiosity was designed to withstand such solar outbursts, the Associated Press reported. But the move could delay the rover's return to science operations, which had been anticipated as early as this weekend. Curiosity landed inside Mars' huge Gale Crater last August to determine if the area has ever been capable of supporting microbial life. The robot had been operating pretty much flawlessly on the Red Planet until last Wednesday, when it failed to send recorded data home to Earth and didn't shift into its daily sleep mode as planned. The mission team determined that a glitch had affected the flash memory on Curiosity's main, or A-side, computer system. So engineers swapped the rover over to its backup computer, which spurred Curiosity to go into safe mode on Thursday. Since then, the robot's handlers have been working to configure the B-side computer for surface operations and fix the problem with the A-side, which they think may have been caused by a fast-moving charged particle known as a cosmic ray. Curiosity has been on the road to recovery. The rover came out of safe mode on Saturday and began using its high-gain antenna again a day later. Mission officials have expressed confidence that engineers will fix or troubleshoot the glitch soon, saying Curiosity may resume science operations as early as this weekend if all continues to go well. The solar flare may now push that timeline back a bit, however. NASA officials do not expect Tuesday's solar flare to seriously affect any of the agency's other robotic Mars explorers, such as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter or Opportunity rover, the Associated Press reported. Tuesday's flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which blasted a huge cloud of solar plasma toward the Red Planet. CMEs that slam into Earth inject large amounts of energy into our planet's magnetic field, spawning potentially devastating geomagnetic storms that can disrupt GPS signals, radio communications and power grids for days. But CMEs don't have a similar impact on Mars, which lacks a global magnetic field, scientists say.

Last week, the rover's science team announced that analysis of powder from a drilled mudstone rock on Mars indicates past environmental conditions that were favorable for microbial life. Additional findings presented today at a news briefing at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, suggest those conditions extended beyond the site of the drilling. Using infrared-imaging capability of a camera on the rover and an instrument that shoots neutrons into the ground to probe for hydrogen, researchers have found more hydration of minerals near the clay-bearing rock than at locations Curiosity visited earlier. The rover's Mast Camera can also serve as a mineral-detecting and hydration-detecting tool, reported Jim Bell of Arizona State University, Tempe. \"Some iron-bearing rocks and minerals can be detected and mapped using the Mastcam's near-infrared filters.\" Ratios of brightness in different Mastcam near-infrared wavelengths can indicate the presence of some hydrated minerals. The technique was used to check rocks in the \"Yellowknife Bay\" area where Curiosity's drill last month collected the first powder from the interior of a rock on Mars. Some rocks in Yellowknife Bay are crisscrossed with bright veins. \"With Mastcam, we see elevated hydration signals in the narrow veins that cut many of the rocks in this area,\" said Melissa Rice of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. \"These bright veins contain hydrated minerals that are different from the clay minerals in the surrounding rock matrix.\" The Russian-made Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons instrument on Curiosity detects hydrogen beneath the rover. At the rover's very dry study area on Mars, the detected hydrogen is mainly in water molecules bound into minerals. \"We definitely see signal variation along the traverse from the landing point to Yellowknife Bay,\" said DAN Deputy Principal Investigator Maxim Litvak of the Space Research Institute, Moscow. \"More water is detected at Yellowknife Bay than earlier on the route. Even within Yellowknife Bay, we see significant variation.\" Findings presented today from the Canadian-made Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer on Curiosity's arm indicate that the wet environmental processes that produced clay at Yellowknife Bay did so without much change in the overall mix of chemical elements present. The elemental composition of the outcrop Curiosity drilled into matches the composition of basalt. For example, it has basalt-like proportions of silicon, aluminum, magnesium and iron. Basalt is the most common rock type on Mars. It is igneous, but it is also thought to be the parent material for sedimentary rocks Curiosity has examined. \"The elemental composition of rocks in Yellowknife Bay wasn't changed much by mineral alteration,\" said Curiosity science team member Mariek Schmidt of Brock University, Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada. A dust coating on rocks had made the composition detected by APXS not quite a match for basalt until Curiosity used a brush to sweep the dust away. After that, APXS saw less sulfur. \"By removing the dust, we've got a better reading that pushes the classification toward basaltic composition,\" Schmidt said. The sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay likely formed when original basaltic rocks were broken into fragments, transported, re-deposited as sedimentary particles, and mineralogically altered by exposure to water.

Our star can disrupt communications between the two planets in this alignment, which is known as a Mars solar conjunction, so Curiosity's handlers at Mission Control had temporarily stopped sending commands to the 1-ton rover. But the heavens have shifted, bringing Mars and Earth back in touch and the Curiosity rover back within reach of its masters. \"Can you hear me now? Conjunction is over.

Curiosity's handlers sent no commands to the rover for most of April, because Mars was on the opposite side of the sun from Earth at the time. But this planetary alignment, known as a Mars solar conjunction, is now over, and the mission team is planning to drill into a Red Planet rock soon and then send Curiosity off on an epic, miles-long trek to the base of a huge and mysterious mountain. \"A couple of weeks to move to the site and drill, and then the experiments themselves can take also a couple of weeks - that's about the time scale we're looking at,\" said Curiosity deputy project scientist Ashwin Vasavada, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"And then we'd hopefully get going.\" He stressed, however, that this timeframe could shift depending on how the drilling operation goes, and what Curiosity discovers. Curiosity healthy after 'spring break'. The Curiosity rover wasn't idle during conjunction. It continued monitoring Martian weather and radiation and perfomed some relatively simple science work using commands sent up in advance, Vasavada said. \"That all went fine - it kind of executed flawlessly a long set of preplanned activities,\" he told SPACE.com. \"We had never planned 30 days at once before, so that was a relief.\" But things have picked up since mission controllers got back in touch with Curiosity late last week. They've already uploaded a minor software update to the rover, which emerged from conjunction in fine health, Vasavada said. Curiosity continues to operate on its backup, or B-side, computer, which it switched to after a glitch knocked out its primary computer in late February. The rover team has still not fully figured out what happened to the A-side, but engineers have made significant troubleshooting progress. For example, Curiosity would have been OK if an issue during conjunction had forced the rover to swap back over to the A-side computer, Vasavada said. Drilling another hole. Curiosity touched down inside Mars' huge Gale Crater last August, kicking off a two-year surface mission to determine if the Red Planet could ever have supported microbial life. The rover team has already checked off this primary goal, announcing in March that a spot dubbed Yellowknife Bay was indeed habitable billions of years ago. Scientists reached this conclusion after studying Curiosity's analyses of material pulled from a 2.5-inch-deep hole the rover drilled into a Red Planet outcrop. Now that conjunction's over, the mission team wants to drill another hole in a nearby rock, to confirm and perhaps extend the exciting results gleaned from the first drilling activity. \"Probably in the next week or two, we will slightly move the rover to a new location, which the science team is actively choosing right now,\" Vasavada said. \"Primarily, it will be to duplicate the results from the first hole, because they were so exciting and, in some cases, unexpected that the people who run the experiments just want to make sure it's really correct before writing all the papers up.\" \"Slightly move\" likely means a few meters or so, he said, adding that the second drilling activity might target intriguing mineral veins or concretions that the team avoided the first time around, not wanting to complicate the drill's maiden operation. Off to Mount Sharp. Once the drilling and subsequent analyses are complete, the team plans to start the long trek to Mount Sharp, the mysterious 3.4-mile-high mountain that rises from Gale Crater's center. Mount Sharp's foothills, which lie about 5 miles away from Yellowknife Bay, were identified as Curiosity's main destination before the rover's November 2011 launch. Mars-orbiting spacecraft have spotted signs that the mountain's base was exposed to liquid water long ago, and the team wants Curiosity to read the Red Planet's environmental history like a book as it climbs up Mount Sharp's lower reaches. Curiosity has taken plenty of time to check out interesting rocks and riverbeds near its landing site thus far, putting just 2,300 feet on its odometer to date. But the long trip to Mount Sharp will force a shift in the rover team's mindset, requiring them to ignore some intriguing features in the interest of making tracks. Mission scientists are already starting to plan Curiosity's route to Mount Sharp, a process that involves identifying high-priority science targets along the way. Still, there's no way the team will be able to look at everything that draws their interest. \"One of our engineers said it's like putting your family in the car to go to Disneyland,\" Vasavada said. \"Along the way, there's the biggest ball of twine, and a little dinosaur museum and all this stuff.

Curiosity is finishing investigations in an area smaller than a football field where it has been working for six months, and it will soon shift to a distance-driving mode headed for an area about 5 miles away, at the base of Mount Sharp. In May, the mission drilled a second rock target for sample material and delivered portions of that rock powder into laboratory instruments in one week, about one-fourth as much time as needed at the first drilled rock. \"We're hitting full stride,\" said Mars Science Laboratory Project Manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"We needed a more deliberate pace for all the first-time activities by Curiosity since landing, but we won't have many more of those.\" No additional rock drilling or soil scooping is planned in the \"Glenelg\" area that Curiosity entered last fall as the mission's first destination after landing. To reach Glenelg, the rover drove east about a third of a mile from the landing site. To reach the next destination, Mount Sharp, Curiosity will drive toward the southwest for many months. \"We don't know when we'll get to Mount Sharp,\" Erickson said. \"This truly is a mission of exploration, so just because our end goal is Mount Sharp doesn't mean we're not going to investigate interesting features along the way.\" Images of Mount Sharp taken from orbit and images Curiosity has taken from a distance reveal many layers where scientists anticipate finding evidence about how the ancient Martian environment changed and evolved. While completing major first-time activities since landing, the mission has also already accomplished its main science objective. Analysis of rock powder from the first drilled rock target, \"John Klein,\" provided evidence that an ancient environment in Gale Crater had favorable conditions for microbial life: the essential elemental ingredients, energy and ponded water that was neither too acidic nor too briny. The rover team chose a similar rock, \"Cumberland,\" as the second drilling target to provide a check for the findings at John Klein. Scientists are analyzing laboratory-instrument results from portions of the Cumberland sample. One new capability being used is to drive away while still holding rock powder in Curiosity's sample-handling device to supply additional material to instruments later if desired by the science team. For the drill campaign at Cumberland, steps that each took a day or more at John Klein could be combined into a single day's sequence of commands. \"We used the experience and lessons from our first drilling campaign, as well as new cached sample capabilities, to do the second drill campaign far more efficiently,\" said sampling activity lead Joe Melko of JPL. \"In addition, we increased use of the rover's autonomous self-protection. This allowed more activities to be strung together before the ground team had to check in on the rover.\" The science team has chosen three targets for brief observations before Curiosity leaves the Glenelg area: the boundary between bedrock areas of mudstone and sandstone, a layered outcrop called \"Shaler\" and a pitted outcrop called \"Point Lake.\" JPL's Joy Crisp, deputy project scientist for Curiosity, said \"Shaler might be a river deposit. Point Lake might be volcanic or sedimentary.

Curiosity snapped 41 images of the Mars moons in the night sky on Aug. 1, with rover scientists then stitching them together to make the final 30-second video. It is the first time a view of the two Martian satellites - called Phobos and Deimos - eclipsing each other has been captured from the vantage point of the planet's surface, NASA officials said. The new Curiosity video has plenty of scientific value in addition to its gee- whiz appeal, officials said. For example, researchers are studying the images to refine their knowledge of the orbits of Phobos and Deimos, both of which appear to be captured asteroids. \"The ultimate goal is to improve orbit knowledge enough that we can improve the measurement of the tides Phobos raises on the Martian solid surface, giving knowledge of the Martian interior,\" Mark Lemmon of Texas A&M University said in a statement. \"We may also get data good enough to detect density variations within Phobos and to determine if Deimos' orbit is systematically changing,\" added Lemmon, who is a co-investigator for Curiosity's Mastcam instrument, which took the pictures using its telephoto lens. Phobos' orbit is taking it closer to the surface of Mars very slowly, researchers said, while Deimos may gradually be getting farther and farther away from the planet. Phobos is just 14 miles wide on average, while Deimos is even smaller. But Curiosity was able to spot both of them because they orbit quite close to the Red Planet's surface - 3,700 miles in Phobos' case and 12,470 miles for Deimos. Earth's moon is gigantic compared to Phobos and Deimos, with a diameter of about 2,160 miles. But our planet's natural satellite orbits much farther away - its average distance is 239,000 miles - so Phobos appears half as big in the sky to Curiosity as Earth's moon does to human skywatchers, NASA officials said.

Arriving at Waypoint 1 will place the rover about one-fifth of the way to its ultimate destination: a 3-mile-high mountain dubbed Mount Sharp. During the long drive, Curiosity traversed 464 feet to the top of Panorama Point where it took photos of the pale outcrop that is Waypoint 1. As of Monday, the car-sized rover was about 245 feet away from the checkpoint, according to NASA officials. \"We had a long and unobstructed view of the hill we needed to climb, which would provide an overlook of the first major waypoint on our trek to Mount Sharp,\" said rover mission planner Jeff Biesiadecki, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in a statement. \"We were able to extend the drive well beyond what we could see by enabling the rover's onboard hazard avoidance system.\" A NASA spacecraft in orbit around the Red Planet helped to map out Curiosity's approximately 5.3-mile path to Mount Sharp. Scientists used imagery collected by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to choose Waypoint 1 as a target for Curiosity. Once the rover reaches the milestone it will pause for a few days to sample the area with its arm, NASA officials explained. Scientists want to sample the waypoints Curiosity comes across during its journey to put together a map of the Martian environment. \"We want to know how the rocks at Yellowknife Bay are related to what we'll see at Mount Sharp,\" Curiosity's project scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology, said in a statement. \"That's what we intend to get from the waypoints between them.

Curiosity made the measurement by scooping up a sample of the Martian dirt under its wheels, sieving it and dropping tiny samples into an oven in its belly, an instrument called Sample Analysis at Mars. \"We heat the soil up to 835C and drive off all the volatiles and measure them,\" said Leshin. \"We have a very sensitive way to sniff those and we can detect the water and other things that are released.\" Aside from water, the heated soil released sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen as the various minerals within it were decomposed as they warmed up. One of Curiosity's main missions is to look for signs of habitability on Mars, places where life might once have existed. \"The rocks and minerals are a record of the processes that have occurred and Curiosity is trying to figure out those environments that were around and to see if they were habitable,\" said Peter Grindrod, a planetary scientist at University College London who was not involved in the analyses of Curiosity data. Flowing water is once thought to have been abundant on the surface of Mars, but it has now all but disappeared. The only direct sources of water found so far have been as ice at the poles of the planet. The other papers included x-ray diffraction images of the soil in order to work out the crystalline structure of the minerals on the Martian surface and analysis of a volcanic rock called \"Jake_M\", which is named after a Nasa engineer. The analysis showed that the rock was similar to a type on Earth known as a mugearite, which is typically found on ocean islands and in rift zones. Grindrod said that the latest results published by the Nasa team were just the start of the scientific insights that would come from Mars in the next few years. \"It's the first flexing of Curiosity's analytical muscles,\" he said. \"Curiosity spent a long time checking out the engineering, instruments and procedures it was going to use - these papers cover just that engineering period. The targets here weren't chosen because of their science goals as such but as good targets to test out the instruments.\" Leshin said that, as well as the excitement of exploring a new world for the first time, the increasingly detailed analysis of the Martian surface would be critical information for planning human missions. As well as the water discovery, analysis of the soil has also shown, for example, the presence of a type of chemical called a perchlorate, which is can be toxic to people. \"It's only there at a 0.5% level in the soil but it impedes thyroid function,\" she said. \"If humans are there and are coming into contact with fine-grained dust, we have to think about how we live with that hazard. To me it's a good connection between the science we do and the future human exploration of Mars.\" She added: \"I do think it's inevitable that we'll send people there and so let's do its as smartly as we can. Let's get as smart as we can before we go.\" ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/26/nasa-curiosity-rover-mars-soil-water"}, {"title": "Curiosity Mars rover approaches \"Cooperstown\"", "date": "2013-10-31", "content": "NASA's Mars rover Curiosity completed its first two-day autonomous drive Monday, bringing the mobile laboratory to a good vantage point for pictures useful in selecting the next target the rover will reach out and touch. When it drives autonomously, the rover chooses a safe route to designated waypoints by using its onboard computer to analyze stereo images that it takes during pauses in the drive. Prior to Monday, each day's autonomous drive came after a segment earlier that day that was exactly charted by rover team members using images sent to Earth. The Sunday-Monday drive was the first time Curiosity ended an autonomous driving segment and then continued autonomously from that same point the next day. The drives brought Curiosity to about 262 feet from \"Cooperstown,\" an outcrop bearing candidate targets for examination with instruments on the rover's arm. The moniker, appropriate for baseball season's end, comes from a named rock deposit in New York. Curiosity has not used its arm-mounted instruments to examine a target since departing an outcrop called \"Darwin\" on September 22. Researchers used the arm's camera and spectrometer for four days at Darwin, and they plan to use them on just one day at Cooperstown. Starting to use two-day autonomous driving and the shorter duration planned for examining Cooperstown serve to accelerate Curiosity's progress toward the mission's main destination - Mount Sharp. In July, Curiosity began a trek of about 5.3 miles, starting from the area where it worked for the first half of 2013 and heading to an entry point to Mount Sharp. Cooperstown is about one-third of the way along the route. The team used images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to plot the route and choose a few points of potential special interest along the way, including Darwin and Cooperstown. \"What interests us about this site is an intriguing outcrop of layered material visible in the orbital images,\" said Kevin Lewis of Princeton University in New Jersey, a participating scientist for the mission who has been a leader in planning the Cooperstown activities. \"We want to see how the local layered outcrop at Cooperstown may help us relate the geology of Yellowknife Bay to the geology of Mount Sharp.\" The team is using images taken from the vantage point reached on Monday to decide what part of the Cooperstown outcrop to investigate with the arm- mounted instruments. The first day of the two-day drive began Sunday with about 180 feet on a southwestward path that rover drivers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, evaluated ahead of time as safe. The autonomous-driving portion began where that left off, with Curiosity evaluating the best way to reach designated waypoints ahead. The vehicle drove about 125 feet autonomously Sunday. \"We needed to store some key variables in the rover's nonvolatile memory for the next day,\" said JPL rover driver John Wright. Curiosity's volatile memory is cleared when the rover goes into energy-conserving sleep mode overnight. The stored variables included what direction the rover was driving when it ended the first day's drive and whether it had classified the next 10 feet in that direction as safe for driving. When it began its second day of driving, Curiosity resumed evaluating the terrain ahead for safe driving and drove 105 feet, all autonomously. This new capability enables driving extra days during multiday activity plans that the rover team develops on Fridays and before holidays.

The car-size Curiosity rover went into safe mode Thursday, a few hours after receiving a software update from its handlers on Earth. But mission engineers have identified and fixed the problem, allowing Curiosity to resume normal operations on Sunday, NASA officials said. \"We returned to normal engineering operations,\" Rajeev Joshi, a mission software and systems engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement Tuesday. \"We are well into planning the next several days of surface operations and expect to resume our drive to Mount Sharp this week.\" Curiosity began heading toward the towering Mount Sharp in early July and has covered about one-third of the 5.3-mile-long trek to date, NASA officials said recently. The recent glitch was caused by an error in Curiosity's onboard software, which resulted in an error in a catalog file, mission team members said. When the new version of Curiosity's software processed the faulty catalog file on Thursday, the rover automatically rebooted its software and went into safe mode. \"The team was able to replicate the problem on ground testbeds the following day,\" NASA officials wrote in a mission update Tuesday. \"Commands recovering the spacecraft were uplinked to the spacecraft early Sunday morning.\" Curiosity has been exploring Mars' 96-mile-wide Gale Crater since August 2012, when it aced a daring and unprecedented landing that saw the rover lowered to the Red Planet's surface by a rocket-powered sky crane. The mission's chief goal is to determine if Mars has ever been capable of supporting microbial life. Curiosity has already answered that question in the affirmative, finding evidence that a site called Yellowknife Bay was indeed habitable billions of years ago. The mission is far from over, however.

The Curiosity rover is in the midst of a long journey to Mount Sharp, a mountain that looms 3 miles above the Red Planet's surface and could hold clues about the ancient environment of Mars. But before it gets to the towering mountain sometime next year, Curiosity will pass the newly named \"Murray Buttes.\" This screenshot from an animated NASA video shows the Murray Buttes, a cluster of steep formations near the base of Mars' Mount Sharp. The cluster of steep-sided Martian formations that makes up Murray Buttes was named in honor of Bruce Murray, a former director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., where Curiosity's mission operation are based. According to a new NASA video description of Curiosity's journey, each of these rocky knobs near the foot of Mount Sharp could fill up the length and width of a football field and stretch up to the height of the goal posts. \"It will be a visually intriguing area for both the science team and the public,\" Curiosity science-team member Ken Herkenhoff, of the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Center, Flagstaff, Ariz., said in a statement. \"I think it will look like a miniature version of Monument Valley in Utah.\" Bruce Murray was the head of JPL from 1976 to 1982, an important era of planetary exploration. In the summer of 1976, Viking 1 and 2 touched down on Mars and became first American spacecraft to land on the Red Planet. Murray also oversaw the launch of Voyager 1 and 2, the most far-flung man-made objects, and he co-founded the Planetary Society with Carl Sagan and engineer Louis Friedman. Murray died on Aug. 29, 2013, at age 81 after a long illness. \"Bruce Murray contributed both scientific insight and leadership that laid the groundwork for interplanetary missions such as robotic missions to Mars, including the Mars rovers, part of America's inspirational accomplishments. It is fitting that the rover teams have chosen his name for significant landmarks on their expeditions,\" said Fuk Li, NASA's Mars exploration program manager at JPL, in a statement. NASA also named another area on Mars after the scientist. The space agency's rover Opportunity is currently climbing part of a crater rim now called \"Murray Ridge.\" Scientists aren't just targeting the Murray Buttes for the potentially stunning vistas Curiosity will see. The buttes also happen to be located in what engineers hope will be a safe passage for Curiosity within a risky band of dark sand dunes at the base of Mount Sharp. \"We're trying to find a place where there's a gap in the sand dunes because we don't feel it's safe cross over the sand dunes with the rover; we'd rather do it on hard rock,\" John Grotzinger, Curiosity's project scientist, explained in the NASA video. Curiosity's older cousin, the rover Spirit, was doomed after getting caught in Martian sand in 2009. After cracking through hard topsoil, Spirit was left spinning its wheels in loose Mars dirt; engineers on the ground never figured out a way to get Spirit out of the sand trap and its mission ended.

In the near future, the mission team plans to drive NASA's 1-ton Curiosity rover to a smooth patch of ground and photograph its six aluminum wheels using the robot's arm-mounted Mars Hand Lens Imager camera, oficials said. \"We want to take a full inventory of the condition of the wheels,\" Curiosity project manager Jim Erickson, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement today. \"Dents and holes were anticipated, but the amount of wear appears to have accelerated in the past month or so,\" Erickson added. \"It appears to be correlated with driving over rougher terrain. The wheels can sustain significant damage without impairing the rover's ability to drive. However, we would like to understand the impact that this terrain type has on the wheels, to help with planning future drives.\" Routes to future destinations may prioritize reducing the time Curiosity spends trundling over sharp rocks and other rough terrain, mission officials added. Engineers also just finished upgrading the rover's software, marking the third such installation peformed since Curiosity touched down inside Mars' huge Gale Crater in August 2012. Among other features, this latest version improves Curiosity's ability to use its robotic arm while on slopes, mission team members said. This skill should come in handy when the rover reaches the base of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles into the Martian sky from Gale Crater's center. Mount Sharp has long been Curiosity's main destination.

Curiosity is currently embarked on a long trek to the base of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles into the Martian sky. The rover recently crossed a sand dune to enter a region called Moonlight Valley, which photos taken from orbit suggested would give Curiosity's wheels a bit of a break. That landscape assessment appears to be on the money, team members said. \"After we got over the dune, we began driving in terrain that looks like what we expected based on the orbital data,\" Erickson said. \"There are fewer sharp rocks, many of them are loose, and in most places there's a little bit of sand cushioning the vehicle.\" Curiosity is expected to arrive at the base of Mount Sharp around June or so. Once there, it will climb up through the mountain's lower reaches, which contain a history of Mars' changing environmental conditions over the eons. But the rover will stop to do some science work along the way to Mount Sharp. The mission team plans to study - and possibly drill into - rocks at a site they've dubbed Kimberley, which lies about 0.67 miles ahead on the route. Curiosity's handlers will further refine the rover's path while it's conducting science work at Kimberley, using orbital imagery to pick the best way forward. \"We have changed our focus to look at the big picture for getting to the slopes of Mount Sharp, assessing different potential routes and different entry points to the destination area,\" Erickson said. \"No route will be perfect; we need to figure out the best of the imperfect ones.\" Curiosity landed in August 2012 to determine if the Red Planet has ever been capable of supporting microbial life.

It is the first meteorite that Curiosity has found on Mars. Scientists have named it Lebanon - presumably because of its shape. Meteorites are lumps of rock and metal that fall from space and impact the surface of a planet. They are time capsules, usually representing the shattered fragments of doomed worlds from the beginning of our solar system. Around 4.6bn years ago, the sun and planets of our solar system began to form. This involved the collision of various rocks and asteroids that melted together and gradually built the Earth, Mars and the other planets. Astronomers call this process \"hot accretion\". With the planets being molten, the heavy metals such as iron would sink towards the centre of each planet, while the lighter rocks would float to the surface and cool into the landforms. As the planets grew in size, however, so the collisions between them tended to become more violent. Sometimes, the nascent worlds would be shattered rather than melted together. Iron meteorites come from the deep, core regions of these doomed planets. According to the Nasa statement that accompanied the image, the cavities visible on this meteorite may once have been filled with olivine minerals. If so, that could indicate it hailed from a place near the core-mantle boundary in its parent world. This was where the iron core gave way to the rocks and minerals of the mantle region. Although this is the first meteorite found by Curiosity, its predecessor rovers Spirit and Opportunity both found numerous smaller examples. The first meteorite on Mars was discovered by Opportunity in 2005, close to its landing site at Meridiani Planum. That too was an iron meteorite. Meteorites may be common on Mars because there is very little atmosphere to weather them away. On Earth, meteorites survive for a few million years before being eroded away. On Mars, the weathering rate is probably a thousand times slower, so meteorites could last for billions of years. They would accumulate on the surface of the planet like flies on fly-paper. A study performed by Bland and Smith in 2000 estimated that there could be between 500 and 500,000 meteorites with a mass greater than 10 grams for every square kilometre of Mars. A meteorite geologist on Mars would have a field day. He or she could use this collection to check for changes in the flux of meteorites over the ages, or look for rare compositions. It is possible that meteorites blasted from the Earth's surface could be lying on Mars, just as pieces of Mars have been found as meteorites on Earth. Curiosity is almost two years into its mission. It is still en route to Mount Sharp, the shallow mountain it will attempt to ascend. Progress has been much slower than anticipated. Partly this is because the mission's geologists keep wanting to stop and investigate interesting looking rocks. And partly because the wheels of the rover are showing more damage that anyone expected. It seems it's tough going when you off-road on Mars.

Those destinations are in an area beginning about 2 miles southwest of the rover's current location, but an appetizer outcrop of a base layer of the mountain lies much closer -- less than one- third of a mile from Curiosity. The rover team is calling the outcrop \"Pahrump Hills.\" \"We're coming to our first taste of a geological unit that's part of the base of the mountain rather than the floor of the crater,\" said Curiosity Project Scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. \"We will cross a major terrain boundary.\" For about half of July, the rover team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, drove Curiosity across an area of hazardously sharp rocks called \"Zabriskie Plateau.\" Damage to Curiosity's aluminum wheels from driving across similar terrain last year prompted a change in route planning to skirt such rock-studded terrain wherever feasible. The one-eighth mile across Zabriski Plateau was one of the longest stretches without a suitable detour on the redesigned route toward the long-term science destination. \"The wheels took some damage getting across Zabriskie Plateau, but it's less than I expected from the amount of hard, sharp rocks embedded there,\" said JPL's Jim Erickson, project manager for Curiosity. \"The rover drivers showed that they're up to the task of getting around the really bad rocks. There will still be rough patches ahead. We didn't imagine prior to landing that we would see this kind of challenge to the vehicle, but we're handling it.\" Another recent challenge appeared last week in the form of unexpected behavior by an onboard computer currently serving as backup. Curiosity carries duplicate main computers. It has been operating on its B-side computer since a problem with the A-side computer prompted the team to command a side swap in February 2013. Work in subsequent weeks of 2013 restored availability of the A-side as a backup in case of B-side trouble. Last week, fresh commanding of the rover was suspended for two days while engineers confirmed that the A-side computer remains reliable as a backup. Curiosity landed inside Gale Crater on Aug. 5, 2012, PDT. During its first year of operations, it fulfilled its major science goal of determining whether Mars ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. Clay-bearing sedimentary rocks on the crater floor in an area called Yellowknife Bay yielded evidence of a lakebed environment billions of years ago that offered fresh water, all of the key elemental ingredients for life, and a chemical source of energy for microbes, if any existed there. NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Project continues to use Curiosity to assess ancient habitable environments and major changes in Martian environmental conditions. The destinations on Mount Sharp offer a series of layers that recorded different chapters in the environmental evolution of early Mars.

The bold and unprecedented maneuver worked on the night of Aug. 5, 2012, eliciting high fives and raucous cheers at mission control at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, as well as at viewing parties around the globe. Curiosity has ridden this wave of enthusiasm for two years now. The rover made landmark discoveries in its first few months of operation, helping reshape scientists' understanding of Mars while barely straying from its landing site inside the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater. And mission team members are excited about what the future may hold, as Curiosity gets closer and closer to its ultimate science destination - the foothills of a 3.4-mile-high mountain called Mount Sharp. Habitable Mars. The main goal of Curiosity's $2.5 billion mission is to determine if Mars has ever been able to support microbial life. The rover found some hints pointing toward past habitability in September 2012, when it rolled through an ancient streambed that mission scientists say probably flowed continuously for more than 1,000 years long ago. And Curiosity sealed the deal a few months later after drilling into rocks at a site called Yellowknife Bay. Analysis of the drilled samples revealed that Yellowknife Bay was inded a habitable environment billions of years ago, likely featuring water benign enough to drink, mission team members said. Further study suggested the area was a lake-and-stream system that may have been able to support simple lifeforms for millions of years at a time. Making such big discoveries so soon was a bit of a surprise, the rover's handlers said. \"Scientifically, Gale Crater, and especially the plains around Mount Sharp, have exceeded any of our expectations,\" Curiosity deputy project scientist Ashwin Vasavada of JPL told Space.com. \"The place was just covered by water on and off again through its history. That's something we never anticipated based on the information we only had from orbit, before landing.\" Rough road. There have been some unpleasant surprises as well, however. The rough terrain inside Gale Crater has taken a toll on Curiosity's wheels, which late last year began accumulating nicks and dings at a worrying rate. \"It started out to be very concerning, to the point where we really just shut down operations for a few weeks to kind of catch our breath and understand what was going on,\" Vasavada said. But after spending a few months studying the Red Planet terrain, performing simulated drives at JPL's \"Mars Yard\" and practicing different driving techniques with Curiosity - driving backward sometimes, for example - the rover's operators think they have things under control now. \"It is a problem, but it's something we can manage, and make it through our mission exactly how we wanted to make it,\" Vasavada said. Looking ahead to Mount Sharp. While the Curiosity rover was pretty sedentary during its first year on Mars, it has been making serious tracks in year number two. The robot has driven a total of about 5.6 miles since touching down on the Red Planet, and about 5 of those miles have come since it departed Yellowknife Bay for Mount Sharp in July 2013, Vasavada said. The target location at the mountain's base still lies 2 to 2.5 miles away, and the mission team expects to get there by the end of 2014, he added. The plan calls for Curiosity to climb up through the mountain's foothills, which likely preserve a record of the Red Planet's transition from a relatively warm and wet place in the ancient past to the cold, dry world it is today. \"The hope is that we can traverse those rock layers and read Mars like a history book, going from the earliest time period where we see some evidence for clays from orbit, to sulfates, to this dusty layer on top where it might represent the modern conditions,\" Vasavada said. \"What we can do is place this one habitable environment that probably represents a snapshot of time into the context of all that history exposed at Mount Sharp,\" he added. \"We can also look at whether there were time periods before, or after - multiple time periods that were also habitable environments.\" Curiosity doesn't have to summit Mount Sharp to get a good read on Martian history. Mission scientists want the rover to make it up at least to the sulfate layers, which apparently begin at about 1,300 to 1,640 feet up the mountain. \"Not to imply that 500 meters is going to be easy - that's a good amount of elevation - but it looks doable from what we're able to map from orbit,\" Vasavada said. Welcoming NASA's next Mars rover? NASA plans to launch a Mars rover based heavily on Curiosity in 2020. The 2020 rover, whose suite of science instruments was announced last week, will search for signs of past life, cache samples for possible future return to Earth and produce oxygen from the Red Planet's carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere, among other activities. It's possible that Curiosity could still be operating when the 2020 rover touches down, Vasavada said. But if that's the case, Curiosity would likely be performing only limited science work, since its radioisotope thermoelectric generator - which converts the heat from plutonium-238's radioactive decay to electricity - will be pretty low on fuel. Curiosity is different in this respect from NASA's Mars rover Opportunity, which is still going strong more than 10 years after landing on the Red Planet. Opportunity is solar-powered and can conceivably continue to operate as long as its solar panels remain relatively dust-free. \"Our best years are going to be the next two to four years, because it's a confluence of getting to our primary science target and still having a juicy power generator,\" Vasavada said. \"We would love to welcome 2020 to Mars, but Curiosity will probably be in the retirement home by then.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26725-mars-rover-curiosity-landing-2nd-anniversary.html"}, {"title": "Curiosity rover photographs thigh bone-shaped rock on Mars", "date": "2014-08-27", "content": "NASA's Curiosity rover photographed an object on Mars last week that bore an uncanny resemblance to a femur or thigh bone.

The one-ton rover touched down inside an ancient impact basin in August 2012. It quickly discovered a region inside the Gale Crater landing site that was chemically and geologically suited for the same kind of rock-eating microbes commonly found on Earth. With the primary goal of the mission met, scientists set about the more daunting task of finding environmental niches that not only could have hosted life, but also preserved signs of its existence - a tricky prospect since the same processes that make rock tend to destroy organic carbon. Scientists figured their best chance for success lay inside rocks on Mount Sharp, a three-mile (five-km) high mountain rising from the center of Gale Crater.  After 18 months of driving, scientists on Thursday announced that Curiosity had arrived at the base of Mount Sharp ahead of schedule, thanks to a somewhat serendipitous decision to take an alternative path that would be gentler on the rover's damaged wheels. Within two weeks, Curiosity will reach an outcrop of rock called Pahrump Hills, where the first drill samples of Mount Sharp real estate will be made, California Institute of Technology geologist John Grotzinger told reporters on a conference call on Thursday.", "url": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-mars-rover-curiousity-target-mountain/2447159.html"}, {"title": "Curiosity rover drill pulls first taste from Mars mountain", "date": "2014-09-29", "content": "NASA's Curiosity Mars rover has collected its first taste of the layered mountain whose scientific allure drew the mission to choose this part of Mars as a landing site. Late Wednesday, September 24, the rover's hammering drill chewed about 2.6 inches deep into a basal-layer outcrop on Mount Sharp and collected a powdered-rock sample. Data and images received early Thursday at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, confirmed success of this operation. The powder collected by the drilling is temporarily held within the sample-handling mechanism on the rover's arm. After landing on Mars in August 2012 but before beginning the drive toward Mount Sharp, Curiosity spent much of the mission's first year productively studying in the Yellowknife Bay area, an area much closer to the landing site, but in the opposite direction. From Yellowknife Bay to the base of Mount Sharp, Curiosity drove more than 5 miles in about 15 months, with pauses at a few science waypoints. The emphasis in mission operations has now changed from drive, drive, drive to systematic layer-by-layer investigation. Jennifer Trosper of JPL is Curiosity Deputy Project Manager.

It's the first time the rover's samples have matched mineral observations from space, NASA officials say. In late September, Curiosity drilled into an outcrop dubbed Pahrump Hills at the base of the 3.4-mile- high Mount Sharp, which has been the 1-ton rover's main science destination since before its November 2011 launch. The samples collected during this operation contain high concentrations of iron-rich hematite, NASA officials announced Wednesday. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter had detected evidence of hematite in the Pahrump Hills area in 2010. \"This connects us with the mineral identifications from orbit, which can now help guide our investigations as we climb the slope and test hypotheses derived from the orbital mapping,\" Curiosity project scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said in a statement. Curiosity touched down inside the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater in August 2012, on a $2.5 billion mission to determine if Mars could ever have supported microbial life. The six-wheeled robot spent about a year near its landing site, eventually finding evidence in drilled samples that an area called Yellowknife Bay was a habitable lake-and-stream system billions of years ago. In July 2013, the rover began the long trek to Mount Sharp, finally reaching the mountain's base this past September. Mission scientists want Curiosity to climb up through Mount Sharp's foothills, whose rocks preserve a history of the planet's changing environmental conditions over time. Curiosity's on-the-ground confirmation of MRO's observations should help mission team members map out the rover's route and activities. \"We're now on a path where the orbital data can help us predict what minerals we'll find and make good choices about where to drill,\" said Curiosity science team member Ralph Milliken, of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. \"Analyses like these will help us place rover-scale observations into the broader geologic history of Gale that we see from orbital data.\" The Pahrump Hills activity was Curiosity's fourth full-up drilling operation. The previous three drilling runs were performed at Yellowknife Bay and on the way to Mount Sharp. The Pahrump Hills powder is different from any of the other samples Curiosity has collected. It contains about 8 percent hematite and 4 percent magnetite; the other three had at most 1 percent hematite and higher concentrations of magnetite, researchers said. \"There's more oxidation involved in the new sample,\" said David Vaniman of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, deputy principal investigator of Curiosity's Chemistry & Mineralogy instrument, or CheMin. Curiosity will spend some time in the Pahrump Hills area - perhaps weeks, perhaps months - as the rover's handlers assess the terrain and search for more drilling targets, NASA officials said.

NASA's Curiosity rover has sniffed out short- lived bursts of methane on Mars, contradicting its initial methane-less reports. The find suggests that something is actively producing the gas, although it is unclear whether it is alien microbes or simply underground water interacting with rock. \"They're very exciting measurements,\" says Christopher Webster at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who presented the results at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco today. \"They've completely opened up the debate again on Mars methane.\" The rover also found evidence of more complex organic compounds in powdered samples of rock - the first definitive detection of organics on the surface of Mars. In addition, it showed that despite recent findings that its landing site was once a habitable lake, Mars has been losing water for billions of years. Another NASA spacecraft, the MAVEN orbiter, is trying to figure out how. Martian methane has been playing whack-a-mole with scientists for the past decade. Detecting it would be exciting because around 90 per cent of Earth's methane comes from living things that eat or produce methane, or the remnants of past life. In 2004, three independent teams using ground-based telescopes and orbiters around Mars reported large amounts of methane in the planet's atmosphere, and an analysis of 2003 data from telescopes in Hawaii saw distinct plumes of methane coming from three regions on Mars. But more recent searches by orbiting spacecraft found no sign of methane at all, meaning either it had vanished over the course of a few years - which should be impossible, as methane is thought to be stable in the atmosphere for nearly 300 years - or that it was never there to begin with. Curiosity, which landed in a region called Gale Crater in August 2012, was supposed to make conclusive measurements. The rover carries a laser spectrometer that can determine the contents of deep breaths of Martian air. Burp from below. In November last year, after 8 months of finding essentially no methane at all, Curiosity took a breath that contained 5.5 parts per billion of methane. \"We were completely surprised,\" Webster says. Over the next two months, the methane levels jumped as high as 9 parts per billion, before falling back to about 0.7 parts per billion. \"We thought we had written the last chapter in the book of methane on Mars last year,\" Webster says. \"And then suddenly this happened a year ago, and we've seen it jump up and go away again.\" \"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say flat-out, I consider this to be the first truly credible detection of methane in the atmosphere,\" says Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado, Boulder, who is the principal investigator on the MAVEN mission. \"A lot of questions have been raised about Earth-based telescopic measurements. This is incontrovertible. I don't see any way it could not be correct. That makes it a very profound measurement.\" But it is also a perplexing one. The fact that the methane spiked and then disappeared again means it probably came from a small source somewhere near the rover - a larger plume farther away would have diffused by the time it reached the rover and made the background levels higher, Webster reasons. Then there's the matter of what is producing it. It could just as easily be from methane-producing microbes living beneath Gale Crater as from an underground aquifer interacting with buried rocks. \"We're still stuck with the fact that methane has multiple possible sources,\" Jakosky says. \"We don't have information yet to tell.\" MAVEN doesn't have enough sensitivity to methane, but the Russian/European ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, due to launch in 2016, might be able to help. The team also reported that sample drilled from a mudstone dubbed Cumberland contained an organic compound called chlorobenzene, which is used on Earth in the production of the pesticide DDT. The compound might not be present in the rock in that form - it could have formed when it was heated inside Curiosity's on-board chemistry laboratory, possibly by interaction with perchlorate compounds in Martian soil. It's also not necessarily a sign of past life on Mars, notes Curiosity project scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology. But it does indicate that it's possible to preserve fragile organic compounds in Martian rocks, a good sign for future missions like NASA's planned rover in 2020. Heavy hydrogen. In another presentation at AGU, Paul Mahaffy of NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland reported new measurements of Gale Crater's deuterium content, an isotope of hydrogen that indicates how much water the planet once had. Deuterium atoms contain an extra neutron, making them heavier than regular hydrogen atoms. On Earth, deuterium is relatively rare, and scientists expect that Mars started out with a similar deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio. But by heating a soil sample to between 550 \u2070C and 950 \u2070C and analysing the vapour it released, Curiosity has found that the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in 3 billion year-old soils is three times that of Earth's. That means much of the lighter form of hydrogen has been lost over time, Mahaffy says. And because we have deuterium ratios from meteorites that predate the soils, we know that Mars has been losing water throughout its history, not in one big cataclysmic event. \"We're filling a point in Mars history that has not been sampled by meteorite studies,\" Mahaffy says. \"We're getting a value that is halfway between what the current atmosphere is and what it was way back when, which plausibly could have been very close to what the Earth's oceans are.\" But it's hard to know how much water there was globally back then, because we don't know how quickly Mars is losing hydrogen today, says Jakosky. \"That's where MAVEN will come in, trying to get that side of the coin.\" ", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26709-curiosity-rover-detects-martian-methane-burps/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Mars Rover Curiosity Mission Gets New Science Chief", "date": "2015-01-06", "content": "The science team on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity mission has a new leader.

Nitrogen is one of the building blocks of larger molecules like DNA and RNA which encode genetic instructions, and proteins. The discovery adds to the evidence that ancient Mars once had conditions suitable for microbial life. On both Earth and Mars, atmospheric nitrogen is locked up as two atoms of nitrogen bound together. The nitrogen atoms have to be separated or \"fixed\" so they can participate in the chemical reactions needed for life. On Earth, certain organisms are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen while smaller amounts of nitrogen are also fixed by energetic events like lightning strikes. Nitrate, a nitrogen atom bound to three oxygen atoms, is a source of fixed nitrogen that can join with various other atoms and molecules. The team made their discovery using the mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph of the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument aboard Curiosity. They detected nitric oxide -one atom of nitrogen bound to an oxygen atom. These fixed nitrogen molecules could be released from the breakdown of nitrates during heating of Martian sediments. The surface of Mars today is inhospitable for known forms of life, so the team thinks the nitrates are ancient, and probably came from non-biological processes like meteorite impacts and lightning in Mars' distant past. Jennifer Stern of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is lead author of a paper on this research published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science_. Stern said: Finding a biochemically accessible form of nitrogen is more support for the > ancient Martian environment at Gale Crater being habitable. Curiosity, whose mission is to discover if Mars ever had conditions suitable for microbial life, has already found evidence of organic matter and dry riverbeds and minerals that only form in the presence of liquid water. The evidence for nitrates was found in scooped samples of windblown sand and dust at a site dubbed Rocknest, and in samples drilled from mudstone at two sites in the Yellowknife Bay area, formed from sediment deposited at the bottom of an ancient lake. The Rocknest sample is a combination of dust blown in from distant regions on Mars and more locally sourced materials, suggesting that nitrates are likely to be widespread across Mars. Along with other nitrogen compounds, the SAM instruments detected nitric oxide in samples from all three sites. The team thinks most of the NO probably came from nitrate which decomposed as the samples were heated for analysis. Certain compounds in the SAM instrument could also release nitrogen as samples are heated, but the amount of NO found is more than twice that which could be produced by SAM even in the most extreme and unrealistic scenario, according to Stern. Stern said: Scientists have long thought that nitrates would be produced on Mars from the energy released in meteorite impacts, and the amounts we found agree well with estimates from this process.

Scientists want the car-size Curiosity rover to check out a \"geological contact\" where two different rock units meet. Curiosity tried to reach such a contact earlier this month, but the robot's six wheels slipped too much during three out of four drives between May 7 and May 13, NASA officials said. \"Mars can be very deceptive,\" Chris Roumeliotis, Curiosity's lead rover driver at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. \"We knew that polygonal sand ripples have caused Curiosity a lot of drive slip in the past, but there appeared to be terrain with rockier, more consolidated characteristics directly adjacent to these ripples,\" Roumeliotis added. \"So we drove around the sand ripples onto what we expected to be firmer terrain that would give Curiosity better traction. Unfortunately, this terrain turned out to be unconsolidated material too, which definitely surprised us and Curiosity.\" So the rover team decided to map out a new route using images captured by Curiosity and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the Red Planet since 2006. This alternate path would allow Curiosity to examine a similar contact to the west. A 72-foot drive on Thursday, during which Curiosity climbed up a hill and dealt with 21-degree slopes, brought the rover close to this contact, NASA officials said. Curiosity, which landed on Mars in August 2012, has been exploring the base of Mount Sharp since September 2014. The geological contact contains light- colored rocks similar to those that Curiosity has already studied near the mountain's base, as well as darker material less familiar to the rover team, researchers said.

This time, the rover selfie comes from a lower viewing angle and shows Curiosity looming over a bore hole left from a drill into a block of Martian rock 30 July at a site dubbed \"Buckskin.\" A camera mounted on the end of the rover's robotic arm captured dozens of individual frames of the rover and its surroundings. Scientists normally use the arm-mounted camera - called the Mars Hand Lens Imager, or MAHLI - to detect features in close-up views of Martian rocks. But the robot arm can double as a selfie stick, and the camera scans across the rover to collect multiple views that image analysts on Earth can stitch together into a self-portrait. The wrist joint on the rover's arm keeps the appendage out of frame in all of the images used in the mosaic, but the arm's shadow is visible on the ground. The sample collected 30 July is the seventh specimen gathered from boring into rock with the rover's percussive drill, and the first since a glitch sidelined the drill in February. \"We were pleased to see no repeat of the short circuit during the Buckskin drilling and sample transfer,\" said Steven Lee, deputy project manager for Curiosity at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"It could come back, but we have made changes in fault protection to continue safely drilling even in the presence of small shorts. We also improved drill percuss circuit telemetry to gain more diagnostic information from any future occurrences.\" Scientists hope to analyze the samples with Curiosity's internal instruments, which comprise a miniature laboratory with ovens, lasers and other high-tech devices, to find out why the region around the Buckskin drill site contains higher levels of silica and hydrogen than other terrain explored by the rover. \"Curiosity initially noted the area with high silica and hydrogen on 21 May while climbing to a site where two types of sedimentary bedrock lie in contact with each other,\" NASA said in a statement. \"Such contact zones can hold clues about ancient changes in environment, from conditions that produced the older rock type to conditions that produced the younger one.\" Curiosity began its fourth Earth year on the red planet 6 August, and its plutonium power source is expected to provide stable electrical supplies for the next few years, according to Ashwin Vasavada, the rover's project scientist at JPL. \"We think we have at least two, three, or four very productive years left, and then several more years after that as the power source degrades,\" Vasavada said in remarks to the NASA Advisory Council on 28 July. A radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, aboard the rover produce electricity from the radioactive decay of plutonium carried to Mars on the spacecraft. The power source degrades a few percent each year, according to Vasavada. \"It was sized to allow a particular pace of operations that match both our payload and the frequency that our team can staff operations and communicate with the rover,\" Vasavada told Spaceflight Now. \"In large part, it comes down to the ability to run down our battery each sol and recharge it overnight. When that is no longer possible, we need to either spread out how often we command the rover or do less each command cycle, and not run the battery down as far.\" Specific activities that require large amounts of electricity, such as long drives and use of Curiosity's ovens which heat up soil samples for scientific examination, may have to be spread out over multiple days in the future as the power levels run down. Curiosity also has more demands on its power source than other plutonium- powered probes, such as NASA's Cassini spacecraft and Voyager missions. The extreme temperature swings on Mars require the rover to control its temperature with thermal control loops that pump fluid through the spacecraft, and Curiosity also carries survival heatters. \"Even so, we expect to have enough energy for survival for at least 10 years,\" Vasvada told Spaceflight Now on Thursday. Curiosity completed its two-year prime mission phase in 2014. Rover managers plan to propose another two-year extension to Curiosity's operations on Mars next year. Further extensions, if approved by NASA, will also come in two-year increments under the agency's senior review process. Curiosity arrived at the base of Mount Sharp, a peak the size of Mount Rainier at the center of the rover's landing site at Gale Crater, in September 2014. The robot's first stop at the foot of the mountain is in a geologic deposit named the Murray Formation, thought to be near the boundary between separate rock units comprising Mount Sharp and the floor of Gale Crater. Farther up the mountain, Curiosity will encounter a ridge that shows the chemical signature of hematite, a clay-bearing mineral that forms in watery environments, in data obtained from Mars orbit. \"It will take us another few months, at least, to get through the 150-metre thick broad sloping Murray Formation,\" Vasavada told the advisory committee in late July. \"Then we get to a ridge that as a lot of hematite mineralogy, another clay-bearing rock .\" A stretch goal for the rover is to make it to a boundary between clay and sulphate geologic units believed to be between 6 and 8 kilometres ahead. \"If we get to this boundary of the sulfate-clay area, that's how we're sort of timing our mission,\" Vasavada said. As of this week, Curiosity has logged 11.1 kilometres of driving since it landed in 2012.

The six-wheeled robot recently arrived at a feature named \"High Dune\" to begin the dune campaign. High Dune is part of a dune system scientists have dubbed Bagnold Dunes along the northwestern flank of Mount Sharp, a three-mile-high mountain inside Gale Crater, Curiosity's landing site. The Bagnold Dunes are named for Ralph Bagnold, a British military engineer who pioneered research into how winds transport sand grains in the early 20th century. See a larger mosaic showing fine details of the dunes taken by Curiosity's Mastcam camera Nov. 27. NASA says the lighting of the images was adjusted to approximate how the dunes would appear in daytime on Earth. The rover will spend at least several weeks at the dune site, using its wheels to dig into the sand and reveal the textures lying underneath the wind-blown surface. Curiosity will also scoop up sand for delivery into the rover's internal laboratory, according to NASA. Pits formed in the tracks of Curiosity's wheels revealed finer sand grains than visible on the dune's surface, where winds blow away the smallest particles, leaving the larger grains. Curiosity is the first spacecraft to study active sand dunes on another planet. Observations from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, flying several hundred miles above the red planet, show the dunes are moving about 3 feet, or a meter, every year, scientists said. Researchers believe dunes on Mars behave differently than they do on Earth. The surface pressure on Mars is about six-tenths of one percent the pressure on Earth, with Martian gravity three times weaker than Earth's. \"These dunes have a different texture from dunes on Earth,\" said Nathan Bridges from the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, co-leader of the dune campaign planning team. \"The ripples on them are much larger than ripples on top of dunes on Earth, and we don't know why. We have models based on the lower air pressure. It takes a higher wind speed to get a particle moving. But now we'll have the first opportunity to make detailed observations.\" Learning how dunes form on Mars today will help scientists study what processes shaped sandstones rock layers on the red planet, which are made from dunes that turned into rock long ago. Curiosity is stopping at the dunes on its trek up Mount Sharp, exploring distinct layers on the way up the mountain to study different eras in Mars' geologic past.

Tridymite is generally associated with silicic volcanism, which is known on Earth but was not thought to be important or even present on Mars, researchers said. The discovery of tridymite might induce scientists to rethink the volcanic history of Mars, suggesting that the planet once had explosive volcanoes that led to the presence of the mineral. \"On Earth, tridymite is formed at high temperatures in an explosive process called silicic volcanism. Mount St Helens, the active volcano in Washington State, and the Satsuma-Iwojima volcano in Japan are examples of such volcanoes,\" said Richard Morris, Nasa planetary scientist at Johnson. \"The combination of high silica content and extremely high temperatures in the volcanoes creates tridymite,\" said Morris. \"The tridymite was incorporated into 'Lake Gale' mudstone at Buckskin as sediment from erosion of silicic volcanic rocks,\" he added.

Curiosity team members had modeled this novel technique repeatedly using computers, but it had never been tested fully here on Earth, let alone employed on the surface of another world. Still, everything worked perfectly at crunch time, and Curiosity soon began exploring the interior of Mars' 96-mile-wide Gale Crater.

The rover quickly came across a layer of mudstone, a type of rock formed by sediment accumulation at the bottom of a lake. And Curiosity is still examining that same layer, despite traveling about 100 vertical feet up the mountain. While mission team members don't know the exact rate at which the mudstone was deposited, the extent of the layer suggests that the Gale Crater lake system persisted for millions, or perhaps even tens of millions of years, Vasavada said. \"We're talking significant periods of time - periods of time that are even significant for biology, if it ever took hold on Mars ,\" he said. \"The timescales involved are really kind of mind-boggling.\" ## More mountaineering ahead NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft has identified three geological \"units\" above Curiosity that the rover's handlers want to explore before the mission comes to an end. One of these rock layers contains the iron-oxide mineral hematite, and another is rich in clays, which form in liquid water. The third unit contains healthy concentrations of sulfates, and could mark the beginning of a transition toward the cold and dry Mars that exists today, scientists have said. Curiosity needs to gain another 1,000 vertical feet or so to sample all three of these units, Vasavada said. Doing so will likely require putting an additional 5 miles on the robot's odometer, he added. Curiosity has incurred a significant amount of wheel damage since touchdown, but new driving techniques and avoidance of the most rugged terrain should allow the rover to go at least 5.6 more miles on the Red Planet, Vasavada said. The rover's science instruments are all still working fine, so Vasavada is eager to see what Curiosity finds over the next few years. \"Hopefully, the big results aren't all behind us,\" he said. \"We still would love to find a really whopping signature of organic molecules, so that we get an idea of what was present on ancient Mars.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/33655-mars-rover-curiosity-fourth-anniversary.html"}, {"title": "Curiosity Rover Finds and Examines a Meteorite on Mars", "date": "2016-11-02", "content": "The dark, smooth-surfaced object at the center of this Oct. 30, 2016, image from the Mast Camera on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover was examined with laser pulses and confirmed to be an iron-nickel meteorite.

In November, we reported on a discovery that had scientists convinced they found evidence of ancient organisms, and today, NASA announced their scientists believe they've found another. In recent weeks, scientists used NASA's Curiosity Mars rover to examine slabs of rock cross-hatched with shallow ridges. All signs lead them to believe they're mud cracks, which makes them the first to be confirmed on the Red Planet by the Curiosity mission. \"Even from a distance, we could see a pattern of four- and five-sided polygons that don't look like fractures we've seen previously with Curiosity,\" said Curiosity science team member Nathan Stein in NASA's announcement. \"It looks like what you'd see beside the road where muddy ground has dried and cracked.\" If this interpretation holds up, it would be evidence that the ancient era when these sediments were deposited included wet conditions, followed by drying. High resolution images have pointed to the existence of deltas, gullies and river valleys on Mars, which is why scientists view it as one of the places in our solar system most likely to be/have been home to alien life. \"If these are indeed mud cracks, they fit well with the context of what we're seeing in the section of Mount Sharp Curiosity has been climbing for many months,\" said Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. \"The ancient lakes varied in depth and extent over time, and sometimes disappeared. We're seeing more evidence of dry intervals between what had been mostly a record of long-lived lakes.\" Besides the cracks, scientists have also observed nearby sandstone layers interspersed with the mudstone layers as well as the presence of a layering pattern called cross-bedding. This pattern is typical where water flows vigorously, such as near the shore of a lake. While scientists are continuing to examine the cracks, the Curiosity Rover has moved uphill toward a future rock drilling location for further exploration.

This image was taken on March 19, 2017, as part of a set used by rover team members to inspect the condition of the rover's six wheels during the 1,641st Martian day, or sol, of Curiosity's work on Mars. Holes and tears in the wheels worsened significantly during 2013 as Curiosity was crossing terrain studded with sharp rocks on the route from near its 2012 landing site to the base of Mount Sharp. Team members have used MAHLI systematically since then to watch for when any of the zig-zag shaped grousers begin to break. The last prior set of wheel-inspection images from before Sol 1641 was taken on Jan. 27, 2017, and revealed no broken grousers. Longevity testing with identical aluminum wheels on Earth indicates that when three grousers on a given wheel have broken, that wheel has reached about 60 percent of its useful life. Curiosity has driven well over 60 percent of the amount needed for reaching all the geological layers planned as the mission's science destinations, so the start of seeing broken grousers is not expected to affect the mission's operations. Curiosity's six aluminum wheels are about 20 inches in diameter and 16 inches wide. Each of the six wheels has its own drive motor, and the four corner wheels also have steering motors.

The landscape is strewn with rocks, and all those sharp bits are taking a toll on NASA's Curiosity rover. The rover's wheels are made from solid aluminum, which is pretty tough stuff, but a new image released Tuesday shows breaks in some of the raised wheel treads. NASA spotted the breaks on March 19 during a routine check of the wheels. The last check took place on Jan. 27, so the breaks are relatively fresh. The wheel-tread issue is nothing new, but the current extent of the damage is notable. NASA images from early 2016 showed just cracks in the wheels. Curiosity has rolled across nearly 10 miles of Mars since landing in mid-2012. Dents and holes started to appear as early as 2013. Curiosity Project Manager Jim Erickson says the left middle wheel is \"nearing a wheel-wear milestone,\" but \"all six wheels have more than enough working lifespan remaining to get the vehicle to all destinations planned for the mission.\" The rover is currently in residence in an area known as the Murray formation in the region of Mount Sharp. The fascinating mountain is located in the Gale crater, Curiosity's landing site. NASA has plans for the rover to travel at least 3.7 miles more as it studies Mount Sharp's lower rock layers.

NASA's car-sized Mars rover has been successfully roaming the surface of the red planet for almost five years now, but a recent check of its six wheels shows that one has breaks in its zigzag treads. NASA says the damage - which it blames on rough terrain - won't keep Curiosity from completing its mission. And it could even give the space agency valuable clues about how to hone the design of an upcoming rover. \"The project that is developing NASA's next Mars rover, for launch in 2020, had made changes to wheel design,\" says Curiosity project manager Jim Erickson. \"And the new design has demonstrated much longer wheel lifespan in long-distance driving tests.\" The Curiosity mission team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory monitors the wheels by studying photos taken by the rover's own Mars Hand Lens Imager, the same camera the rover uses to snap its famous selfies. A photo taken in January showed no major damage to the aluminum wheels, each of which is about 20 inches in diameter and about 16 inches wide. But a March 19 photo showed that the middle left wheel has two broken tread sections. NASA says that when three of these tread sections, or \"grousers,\" are broken, the wheel has reached about 60 percent of its useful life. Through March 20, Curiosity has driven 9.9 miles. Reaching its farthest uphill destination will require the rover to drive no more than an additional 3.7 miles. NASA says the new rover will have thicker wheels with curved rather than zigzag grousers. Engineers have tested this new design driving over the same types of terrain that damaged Curiosity's wheels. Curiosity's primary mission - to determine whether Mars was ever capable of supporting microbial life - was fulfilled within the rover's first year on the red planet, when it found evidence that Mars once had liquid water and the chemical ingredients for life. But the rover has more work to do. As Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada says, \"The mission's planned studies are intended to further understanding about how an environment that was very wet became more harsh and dry.\" In any case, Curiosity doesn't seem particularly bothered by the damage to its wheel - at least if you believe its tweets.

The swap worked, and the car-size robot resumed full science operations a few weeks later. But the computer issue was far scarier than this breezy recap would suggest, according to the \"60 Minutes\" segment on CBS. The pilot was supposed to recognize the problem on its own and cede control to the co-pilot automatically, said Rob Manning, chief engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages Curiosity's mission. This didn't happen, however; the pilot acted like it had developed \"an attitude,\" Manning told \"60 Minutes\" reporter Bill Whitaker. \"When we told it to go take a nap, it refused to take a nap,\" Manning said. \"Then it refused to take pictures. Then it refused to do more science throughout the day. It just stopped doing these things. And we said, 'What the heck is going on?' \"Time is running out, because in an hour it's going to turn its radio off and stay off forever, and we'll lose this very expensive rover,\" he added. So Curiosity's handlers beamed a command to shut down the pilot, figuring that the co-pilot would then take over. \"We're waiting for the co-pilot to wake up and then turn on its radio to let us know that it was alive,\" Manning told Whitaker. \"We should get a signal. Nothing. Another minute goes by. Nothing. Four minutes go by. Now we're starting to get really worried that maybe\" \"Sounds like a movie,\" Whitaker interjected. \"It really was,\" Manning said. \"Yeah, it was getting nerve-wracking. And bing, there was the signal. And the backup pilot was obviously in charge.\" The backup remains in charge to this day, though engineers have managed to fix the pilot, Manning said. Curiosity touched down inside the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater on the night of Aug. 5, 2012, tasked with determining if the area has ever been capable of supporting microbial life. The rover's work near its landing site allowed mission researchers to announce, in March 2013, that Gale Crater was indeed habitable billions of years ago. Further observations by Curiosity have revealed that the crater harbored lake- and-stream systems that persisted for long stretches in the ancient past - perhaps millions of years at a time. Since September 2014, Curiosity has been exploring the foothills of Mount Sharp, which rises more than 3 miles into the Martian sky from Gale's center. The rover is reading the rock layers as it climbs, looking for clues about how, why and when Mars transitioned from a relatively warm and wet world to the cold and dry planet it is today.

The red planet is littered with rusty red rocks and, as far as we know, devoid of any kind of life. But even so, rovers still roam the surface of the world on humanity's behalf, making their solitary treks along previously unexplored paths. And sometimes, they make friends. NASA's Curiosity rover - which has been exploring the red planet's Gale Crater since 2012 - appears to have a little pet rock caught in one of its wheels. The rock got stuck in the right front wheel at some point in the last couple weeks, but scientists aren't exactly sure when it started hitching a ride because the rover doesn't snap photos of its wheels every day. This isn't the first time a rock has gotten caught in Curiosity's shoe, according to Emily Lakdawalla, a planetary scientist writing a book about the rover. Lakdawalla said that NASA and other interested folks back on Earth keep an eye on Curiosity's wheels and the rocks that might pop up in them as it roams the Martian surface. Scientists also spotted another rock, which appeared in that same right front wheel starting in January and disappearing by April, according to Ashwin Vasavada, a Curiosity project scientist. The current pet rock was seen in photos taken on Sol 1729 and 1730, which translates to June 17 and June 18 on Earth. \"We don't exactly know how the rocks get in the wheels, but it's likely that they can hop in as the wheels break rocks and sink into the soil around loose rocks,\" Vasavada said via email. As for the rock's effect on Curiosity's wheels, it seems to be pretty benign. The rocks are small and relatively soft, Vasavada said, so they shouldn't pose too much of an issue to the long-running rover's movements. However, it's always possible that something unexpected could happen. \"There are some bad scenarios, such as when a rock gets jammed and makes a larger hole in a wheel, or if a rock interferes with some cables that run to the wheel motors,\" Vasavada said. \"But we don't think those are credible problems with these small rocks.\" Scientists have Curiosity take these photos of its wheels to keep an eye on any holes that have developed in the rover's machinery. The holes in Curiosity's wheels are a sign of the wear and tear the rover has taken on during its years of work on the red planet, but for the moment, the worn wheels are still functioning well.

Her professional career set her on a path to NASA where she shaped future human spaceflight programs and activities as the deputy associate administrator for NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate. She also held roles as the director of NASA's Sciences and Exploration Directorate, and as the deputy center director for Science & Technology at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Of her many accomplishments at NASA, her work on the Curiosity rover is a lasting point of pride. As the 5-year anniversary of Curiosity's successful Mars landing on the night of August 5, 2012, approaches, the Daily Herd sat with President Leshin to reflect on Curiosity's success, her own path to NASA, and what she sees for the future. Leshin foresees a time when humans will land on Mars and make rapid discoveries. \"It takes a person 45 seconds to do what a rover does in a day,\" says Leshin. \"We have actually measured this. It's so much more efficient with a human, but we don't know how to do it yet. There are a lot of problems to be solved between now and then, but we will get there.\" What led to your interest and work with NASA? I have very vivid memories of seeing the first photos of the surface of Mars from the Viking landers in Time magazine when I was a 10-year-old girl. I just remember wanting to reach out and touch those rocks. I was enthralled by them. From that point on, Mars held a huge fascination for me. So to get to be there on the very first night that Curiosity landed and see the Martian rocks from our own rover was just coming full circle. Once I was in school I realized I wanted to work in space science, but there are many different ways you can do that and most of them don't involve working at NASA. Being a university professor is a great way to be a space scientist, and I was doing that. I got called to NASA for some policy opportunities, to help contribute to the future direction of human space flight and to contribute to the way the agency was thinking about that. And then I got the chance to lead a very big organization there. I give NASA a ton of credit for bringing me here to WPI. Certainly, the biggest leap in my career was going from being a professor to leading a huge science organization at NASA. What was your role in the development and deployment of Curiosity? I was on the very first team that worked to define the science goals of this rover, and I was involved in two sensors of Curiosity that studied the chemical makeup of the materials on the surface. The bigger sensor is SAM. SAM looks at volatiles and gases that are in soils and rocks. In the beginning, I was a scientist on these two sensor instruments, but during the first couple of years, I played an operations role that was called a long-term planner. Every day the rover is operating, which for the first year, that was every day-and for the first 90 days that was on Mars time because the Mars day is a little longer than an Earth day-the tactical operations team is there. It's like having a baby. You sleep when the baby sleeps, you're awake when the baby's awake. Each day, there's a team to figure out what the rover learned yesterday, figure out what the rover is telling us, and figure out what we want it to do today. The team plans those observations, vets them, and makes sure they are appropriate. Then they uplink them to the rover for it to do the next day. The LTP looks a little beyond the tactical day to make sure you're not just staring at whatever is right in front of you, but that you have the long-term goals in mind. There were about six of us and we would do three or four days in a row and then someone else would take over. My biggest scientific contribution from Curiosity was the first paper that we wrote on the Mars dirt. We discovered a lot of water in the dirt, and some other things. The instrument is right inside the belly of the rover, about the size of a microwave oven. We'd drop a half a baby aspirin-size worth of dirt into it, an oven would heat it, the gases would come up, and we analyzed them. It was very exciting. It wasn't a surprise that there was water there, but the amount surprised me. It's right there at the surface, probably anywhere you look on Mars, it's there. It's the amount of water you would find on the driest desert on earth. Tell us about the atmosphere in the control room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California during the landing. Were there specific concerns over things that might go wrong? It felt exhilarating. Everyone thinks the night of the landing is the beginning, which it is, but it's also a culmination of a decade of work. It takes a long time to build these things. In the case of Curiosity, she was delayed two years. She was supposed to launch in 2010 but because of some technical challenges, we chose to delay to the next launch window to Mars-those windows come about every 26 months. That night became all about the nights and weekends away from family, and all the hard work that thousands of people have put in to get us to this point. So it was huge exhilaration, and relief that it was successful. And there was so much excitement about what would come next. The night Curiosity landed it was August 5 on the West Coast at 10:30 pm although the official Zulu time was August 6, which is my birthday. It was a great birthday present when we landed successfully. I'll tell you a story. I was a scientist and team media spokesperson on the Mars Polar Lander mission that launched in 1998. It was live on CNN when it landed and it crashed. We were waiting for the signal, ready to jump up and down, and ... nothing. Of course, there are a lot of different reasons you might not get a signal at landing, and it could still be fine. For the next four days we were trying to see if the lander survived. It was awful. So for Curiosity, I was nervous. I have been there and I know what it's like when it doesn't work, and it's way more fun when it does. The landing system on Curiosity is a bit wild. They call it seven minutes of terror because it is going from 13,000 miles per hour when you hit the top of the atmosphere to zero when you land on the surface in seven minutes. All the things that have to happen in that time are terrifying, and there's nothing you can do because it's all happening automatically. When you are getting the signal, it already happened 10 minutes ago because of the light travel time. Immediately after the landing, we ran across to the operations center and started working. Because now the rover is on Mars. You've got to make sure it's safe and figure out where you are, and figure out what you are going to do first. We all worked that whole night and basically every night after for a very long time. Has the rover performed to expectations? Any unplanned-for complications?* She's done very well. We have had a few glitches, but that's expected since she is driving around on a real planet. Most of the challenges we have had are on the drill, but they are working on that. Her wheels wore more intensely than we thought, but we are dealing with all that. The amazing thing is if you have a rover that's working on Mars you can deal with almost anything-just to see how the team comes together to work on almost any problem. Think Apollo 13-that's the extreme example of how people came together to try to figure out how to work a problem. The engineers are incredible-they can figure out a work-around for almost anything. How have you remained active on the Curiosity team, and what is your role? I am technically on the team. I have been staffed as an LTP for three days since coming to WPI just to prove I could be a college president and drive a rover on Mars at the same time. And I did it. And I have done it when people needed me to fill in for one day, but I am no longer able to do three days in a row. I am still very much in touch with colleagues. There are a lot of younger scientists on the team and they need to get their chance to step in and shine so I am happy to have others step in. What can higher ed do differently to support the exploration of the solar system and beyond? WPI's focus on interdisciplinary programs and project-based learning is very much in line with what's needed to train the next generation of explorers. The scientific problems we are solving on Mars are very multidisciplinary and the engineering problems are certainly multidisciplinary. It's very much about systems thinking and approaches and teaming, and being able to jump in and solve a problem quickly and to assess a situation and start to move toward solutions. This stuff isn't theoretical. This rover really is on Mars. You can't send a mechanic up to fix her, so you have to work problems in creative ways. So I think our whole approach to educating scientists and engineers is very much in line with what NASA needs for the future. Would you want to go to Mars? I'd love to do it. The idea of setting foot on Mars would be extraordinary. That would be the childhood dream come true. I'm too old, but I think our students could have that chance, and I look forward to being right there cheering them on.

On the night of Aug. 5, 2012, the car-size robot aced a dramatic and harrowing landing, settling softly onto the Red Planet's surface after being lowered on cables by a rocket-powered \"sky crane.\" The success of this unprecedented maneuver sparked eruptions of emotion at mssion control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California - and at late-night viewing parties all over the world. Curiosity landed on Mars at 10:17 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5 - that's 1:17 a.m. EDT on Aug. 6 - with the signal of its success reaching Earth 14 minutes later after crossing the 154 million miles between Mars and Earth. Within weeks of its arrival inside Mars' 96-mile-wide Gale Crater, Curiosity hit scientific pay dirt, rolling through an ancient streambed where water once flowed. And, not long after that, mission scientists revealed a bombshell: Billions of years ago, a nearby area known as Yellowknife Bay was part of a lake that could have supported microbial life. But that's not where Curiosity's story ends. The rover has continued to piece together details about the ancient Gale Crater environment - work that has led to another exciting find. \"I feel like we're arriving at a second conclusion from the mission that's just as powerful as the first, which is that habitable environments persisted on Mars for at least millions of years ,\" Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada, of JPL, told Space.com. Rolling up Mount Sharp. Curiosity worked near its landing site on Gale's floor for its first year on Mars. Then, the nuclear-powered rover began a 5-mile trek to the towering Mount Sharp, which rises about 3.4 miles into the Red Planet sky from Gale's center. The mountain's foothills had long been Curiosity's main science destination, even before the rover's November 2011 launch. Mission team members wanted the six-wheeled robot to work its way up through Mount Sharp's lower reaches, studying the rock layers there for clues about Mars' long-ago transition from a relatively warm and wet world to the cold, arid place it is today. And that's what Curiosity has been doing for the past three years. Since arriving at Mount Sharp in September 2014, the robot has climbed about 600 vertical feet, drilling, sampling and studying numerous rocks that are part of a geological division that mission scientists call the Murray Formation. Curiosity found that most of this rock is fine-grained mudstone - classic lake-bed deposits, Vasavada said. Such deposits on Earth generally take millions of years to accumulate, leading the team to conclude that Gale Crater's lake system was long-lasting. That's a big deal, because Curiosity's work at Yellowknife Bay captured just \"a snapshot in time,\" Vasavada said. Based on the initial findings, \"that lake may only have been around for 100 or 1,000 years at the minimum,\" he said. \"There was a risk that our habitability discovery only applied to a short amount of time.\" More work to do. Curiosity has already seen some changes during its climb up Mount Sharp. For example, the mudstone was pretty much continuous at and near the mountain's base, but that finely grained stuff gets broken up by other deposits closer to the top of the Murray Formation, Vasavada said. \"There are intervals of deposits that are consistent with forming in near- shore environments where rivers are reaching the edge of the lake, or even in dry environments where the lake has presumably receded,\" he said. \"But the lake then reappears.\" And Gale Crater likely remained habitable even through such periodic dry spells, Vasavada added. That's because groundwater probably remained, even if the lake site was dry on the surface. This groundwater also outlasted the lakes, he said. Mission scientists know this because Curiosity has spotted evidence that liquid water flowed through Gale's lake deposits after they dried out and were buried, compressed and fractured. \"So there's a whole other era of water that's, by definition, after the lakes,\" Vasavada said. \"It suggests that the water was there even longer than the timescale of the lakes.\" Vasavada and his colleagues hope to learn more about this other era, and Gale's early history in general, as Curiosity goes higher up the mountain. Ideally, mission scientists would like to reach three other rock layers that are above the Murray Formation. The first is Vera Rubin Ridge, a feature with lots of the iron-containing mineral hematite; the second is a clay-rich unit; and the third is one dominated by sulfates. The clay unit was probably exposed to lots of liquid water in the ancient past, whereas sulfates imply that water was scarcer, Vasavada said. \"There's this idea that you go from the clays to the sulfates, and you're going to be witnessing some kind of drying out of the environment at Gale Crater,\" he said. \"Whether that has anything to do with the global drying out of Mars we'd love to figure out. But at the very least, it's a major environmental change within Gale Crater.\" Curiosity has already been eyeing Vera Rubin Ridge and should start studying the formation in earnest in the next month or two, Vasavada said. If everything goes according to plan, the rover should get to the clay unit by the end of the year and arrive at the sulfate region, which is about 650 feet above Curiosity's current location, a year or two after that. \"In the next three years or so, we'll probably see all of those units,\" Vasavada said. In good health. Curiosity has already far outlasted its warranty; the rover's $2.5 billion mission was originally scheduled to last just two Earth years. But there's no reason to think Curiosity won't be able to power through three more years on the Red Planet; the rover is in good shape overall, Vasavada said. But one major health problem continues to afflict Curiosity: The rover has been unable to use its drill since December 2016. This is a big blow, because the drill - which sits at the end of Curiosity's 7-foot-long robotic arm - allows the robot to access the pristine interiors of rocks and, therefore, characterize ancient environments. The issue lies in the drill feed mechanism, which moves the drill bit forward and backward. Until about a month ago, Curiosity engineers were focused primarily on diagnosing the problem and fixing it in a way that would restore normal drill operations, Vasavada said. But the team is now investigating an alternative drilling method - using the arm itself, not the feed motor, to move the drill. \"That requires a lot of work - to figure out if that's safe, and to figure out how to do it, and how to command it,\" Vasavada said. \"But it's promising, and that may be where we concentrate our efforts going forward.\" Though he and other mission team members are chiefly concerned with the future - fixing the drill and continuing Curiosity's climb up Mount Sharp, for example - the events of Aug. 5, 2012, still have a special place in Vasavada's heart. \"When I look at the landing video, I still get really emotional; I have a hard time giving talks when I show the video, because it takes me like a minute to recover,\" he said. \"It's remembering the emotion of that night, where your whole career is depending on seven minutes of this stuff going right - and when it actually did work, realizing that you had a future.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/37722-mars-rover-curiosity-five-years-anniversary.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Curiosity Rover Spots Wispy Clouds in Martian Skies", "date": "2017-08-26", "content": "New images from NASA's Curiosity rover revealed wispy, early-season clouds streaking across the Martian sky. The clouds on Mars resemble the thin ice-crystal cirrus clouds found in Earth's atmosphere. The images, taken by the rover's Navigation Camera on July 17, offer the best view yet of such clouds captured by Curiosity. \"It is likely that the clouds are composed of crystals of water ice that condense out onto dust grains where it is cold in the atmosphere,\" John Moores, a Curiosity science-team member from York University in Toronto, said in a statement from NASA. \"The wisps are created as those crystals fall and evaporate in patterns known as 'fall streaks' or 'mare's tails.' While the rover does not have a way to ascertain the altitude of these clouds, on Earth such clouds form at high altitude.\" Similar cloud patterns have been observed before by Curiosity and other missions to the Martian surface, such as NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander in 2008, which surveyed higher latitudes of the Martian arctic. However, the recent observations represent Curiosity's clearest view of the wispy clouds from the rover's vantage point of about 5 degrees south of the equator, according to the statement. Temperatures vary more on Mars than they do on Earth due to the Red Planet's elliptical orbit around the sun. Previously, a belt of ice-crystal clouds has been seen near the equator when Mars was at its most distant point from the sun, also known as aphelion. The new images of the clouds - called the \"aphelion cloud belt\" - were taken about two months before the planet's farthest point in orbit. In addition, the clouds were only seen in the early morning and had disappeared by midday. Therefore, researchers suggest the morning clouds spotted by Curiosity could be an early stage of the aphelion cloud belt, according to the statement. Curiosity recently celebrated the fifth anniversary of its August 2012 landing on Mars. Using the rover's Navcam, researchers captured two sets of eight images of the clouds. The rover's camera was pointed nearly straight up for one set and then just above the southern horizon for the other set. The series of images were taken over a span of 4 minutes in the early morning on July 17 and later processed to create an animation of the clouds' movement across the Martian sky. Cloud movement was observed in each set, but dissipated by midday.

The ridge, also called \"Hematite Ridge,\" was informally named earlier this year in honor of pioneering astrophysicist Vera Rubin. \"As we skirted around the base of the ridge this summer, we had the opportunity to observe the large vertical exposure of rock layers that make up the bottom part of the ridge,\" said Fraeman, who organized the rover's ridge campaign. \"But even though steep cliffs are great for exposing the stratifications, they're not so good for driving up.\" The ascent to the top of the ridge from a transition in rock-layer appearance at the bottom of it will gain about 213 feet of elevation - about 20 stories. The climb requires a series of drives totaling a little more than a third of a mile. Before starting this ascent in early September, Curiosity had gained a total of about 980 feet in elevation in drives totaling 10.76 miles from its landing site to the base of the ridge. Curiosity's telephoto observations of the ridge from just beneath it show finer layering, with extensive bright veins of varying widths cutting through the layers. \"Now we'll have a chance to examine the layers up close as the rover climbs,\" Fraeman said. In orbital spectrometer observations, the iron-oxide mineral hematite shows up more strongly at the ridge top than elsewhere on lower Mount Sharp, including locations where Curiosity has already found hematite. Researchers seek to gain better understanding about why the ridge resists erosion, what concentrated its hematite, whether those factors are related, and what the rocks of the ridge can reveal about ancient Martian environmental conditions. \"The team is excited to be exploring Vera Rubin Ridge, as this hematite ridge has been a go-to target for Curiosity ever since Gale Crater was selected as the landing site,\" said Michael Meyer, lead scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the agency's Washington headquarters. During the first year after its landing near the base of Mount Sharp, the Curiosity mission accomplished a major goal by determining that billions of years ago, a Martian lake offered conditions that would have been favorable for microbial life. Curiosity has since traversed through a diversity of environments where both water and wind have left their imprint. Vera Rubin Ridge and layers above it that contain clay and sulfate minerals provide tempting opportunities to learn even more about the history and habitability of ancient Mars.

Curiosity began climbing Vera Rubin Ridge in early September and is using its Mast Camera to identify variations in the terrain ahead, which will help the rover's handlers map a path up the steep slope, according to a statement from NASA. \"We're in an area where this capability of Curiosity has a chance to shine,\" Abigail Fraeman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who leads planning for the mission's investigation of Vera Rubin Ridge, said in the statement. Curiosity is equipped with special filters that can identify certain minerals in the bedrock, as well as a spectrometer that sorts light into thousands of wavelengths. Some of the Mastcam's science filters are used to detect certain minerals based on the wavelengths of light that are either absorbed or reflected. For example, the rover's camera can detect the iron-oxide mineral hematite, which is believed to be abundant in the upper reaches of the Vera Rubin Ridge, according to the statement. Prior to Curiosity landing on the Red Planet in 2012, NASA scientists first detected evidence of hematite on the Vera Rubin Ridge using spectrometer observations from orbit. The mineral usually forms in wet environments, so its presence could provide clues about the planet's watery past, NASA officials said. \"As we approached the ridge and now as we're climbing it, we've been trying to tie what was detected from orbit to what we can learn on the ground,\" Danika Wellington, Curiosity science team member from Arizona State University, said in the statement. \"It's still very much a work in progress. The extent to which iron-bearing minerals here are oxidized relates to the history of interactions between water and rock .\" Curiosity also has a chemistry and camera instrument called the ChemCam. Although this instrument generally uses a laser to identify chemical elements in rocks, it too has color-filtering abilities that can be used to identify the composition of rocks and target minerals across large landscapes. \"The colors of the rocks on the ridge are more interesting and more variable than what we saw earlier in Curiosity's traverse,\" Jeffrey Johnson, a scientist from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said in the statement. Hematite absorbs some wavelengths of green light and reflects red and blue light, which gives the terrain a purplish tint in color images captured by Curiosity. The additional color-discerning capabilities of Curiosity's Mastcam and ChemCam capture a clear view of hematite deposits that are present in the bedrock. \"We're using these multi-spectral and hyper-spectral capabilities for examining rocks right in front of the rover and also for reconnaissance - looking ahead to help with choosing where to drive for closer inspection,\" Johnson said. In fact, Mastcam images taken on Sept. 12 identified hematite in an area that was at the time a few days' drive away, in regions around fractured bedrock. Upon further investigation, NASA scientists found that the mineral was more widely distributed than previously thought and is covered by a layer of tan dust in some areas, causing the hematite to appear patchier than it actually is. The discovery suggests the mineral may have formed early in Mars' ancient past, according to the statement from NASA.

The shapes, which NASA describes as \"star- shaped and swallowtail-shaped tiny, dark bumps in fine-layered bright bedrock of a Martian ridge\" recall gypsum crystals that are found in drying lakes on Earth, but of course, because Mars is not Earth, scientists are considering other explanations for these formations. The structures also raise other questions, such as when the features formed and whether the original mineral that was crystalized within them remains or was eventually dissolved. The results could tell us what was here before, whether it was a drying lake or flowing groundwater. These sesame-sized formations were discovered on an area of the Vera Rubin Ridge called \"Jura\", on the northern slope of Mount Sharp. The Curiosity Rover has been exploring the Vera Rubin Ridge for the past five months. They were intrigued by the visible change in color of Jura, which looks pale and grey, compared to the red of the rest of the ridge. \"We were looking at the color change from one area to another. We were lucky to see the crystals. They're so tiny, you don't see them until you're right on them,\" says Abigail Fraeman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a member of the Curiosity Rover's science team. Images from the Rover are almost immediately posted online, and these fossil- like formations immediately drew attention. Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of JPL was interested, however, in the formations not for their fossil-like appearance, but because of the implications that the structures have for the region's geological history. \"So far on this mission, most of the evidence we've seen about ancient lakes in Gale Crater has been for relatively fresh, non-salty water,\" explains Vasavada. \"If we start seeing lakes becoming saltier with time, that would help us understand how the environment changed in Gale Crater, and it's consistent with an overall pattern that water on Mars became more scarce over time.\" This could represent the difference between a regularly replenished freshwater lake in the mountains, for example, or a salty desert lake where water quickly evaporates. \"In either scenario, these crystals are a new type of evidence that builds the story of persistent water and a long-lived habitable environment on Mars,\" Vasavada said.

More testing of the drill method is planned for the future. NASA's Mars Curiosity rover has conducted the first test of a new drilling technique on the Red Planet since its drill stopped working reliably. This early test produced a hole about a half-inch deep at a target called Lake Orcadie -- not enough for a full scientific sample, but enough to validate that the new method works mechanically. This was just the first in what will be a series of tests to determine how well the new drill method can collect samples. If this drill had achieved sufficient depth to collect a sample, the team would have begun testing a new sample delivery process, ultimately delivering to instruments inside the rover. The drill is used for pulverizing rock samples into powder, which are then deposited into two of Curiosity's laboratory instruments, Sample Analysis at Mars, or SAM, and Chemistry and Mineralogy, or CheMin. Curiosity has used its drill to collect samples 15 times since landing in 2012. Then, in December of 2016, a key part of the drill stopped working. The drill was designed to use two finger-like stabilizers to steady itself against rock; a faulty motor prevented the drill bit from extending and retracting between these stabilizers. After months of effort, Curiosity's engineering team was able to extend the drill all the way out past the stabilizers, but the motor issue persisted. The team posed a challenge for themselves: could they hack the space robot's drill so that it didn't require stabilizers? Images of a new hole on upper Vera Rubin Ridge, Curiosity's current location, suggest this \"MacGyvering\" is paying off. By leaving the drill in an extended position, engineers were able to practice this freehand drilling for months during testing here on Earth. This hole at Lake Orcadie provides the first insights into how this operation will work in the Martian environment. If the previous method was like a drill press, holding the bit steady as it extends into a surface, it's now more freehand. The NASA rover is using its entire arm to push the drill forward, re-centering itself while taking measurements with a force sensor. That sensor was originally included to stop the rover's arm if it received a high-force jolt. It now offers Curiosity a vital sense of touch, preventing the drill bit from drifting sideways too much and getting stuck in rock. \"We're now drilling on Mars more like the way you do at home,\" said Steven Lee, deputy project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. \"Humans are pretty good at re-centering the drill, almost without thinking about it. Programming Curiosity to do this by itself was challenging -- especially when it wasn't designed to do that.\" It hasn't been easy. JPL engineers spent many double-shifts testing the new method, including on weekends and holidays. They also had to perform \"invasive surgery\" on their testbed -- a near-exact replica of Curiosity -- installing a force sensor to match the one on Mars. The Earth-based testbed's sensor had stopped working before Curiosity's launch in 2012, but there had never been reason to replace it before now. \"This is a really good sign for the new drilling method,\" said Doug Klein of JPL, one of Curiosity's sampling engineers. \"Next, we have to drill a full- depth hole and demonstrate our new techniques for delivering the sample to Curiosity's two onboard labs.\" Leaving the drill in its extended position means it no longer has access to a device that sieves, portions and delivers the rock powder to the rover's instruments ). JPL also had to invent a new way to deposit the powder without this device. The new solution makes Curiosity look as though it is adding seasoning to its science, shaking out grains from the drill's bit as if it were tapping salt from a shaker. This tapping has been successfully tested here on Earth -- but Earth's atmosphere and gravity are very different from that of Mars. Whether rock powder on Mars will fall out in the same volume and in a controlled way has yet to be seen. In the days ahead, Curiosity's engineers will evaluate the results of this recent test and likely drill again nearby. If enough sample is collected, they will test portioning the sample out, using the rover's Mastcam to estimate how much powder can be shaken from the drill bit. Though this first test of the drill didn't produce a full sample, Curiosity's science team is excited to see this step on the path back to routine drilling. There's high interest in getting multiple drilled samples from Vera Rubin Ridge, especially from the upper ridge that contains both gray and red rocks. The latter are rich in hematite, an iron oxide mineral that forms in the presence of water. Drilled samples might shed light on the origin of the ridge and the history of its interaction with water.

In that time, Curiosity has traveled almost 12 miles across the martian surface, from its landing zone in Aeolis Palus to its current location on Mount Sharp. Twelve miles might not sound like a lot, but if you were driving a multi-million dollar car with an 11 minute delay on every input, you'd drive slowly too. And even though Curiosity has only driven 11.8 miles in the last 2,000 sols, it's accomplished a great deal. Perhaps Curiosity's most important discovery is that Mars had the potential to support life in the past. Early in Curiosity's career, it drove into a dry riverbed, revealing that liquid water existed on Mars in large quantities. While it's not the same as proving that life existed on Mars at some point, it is a good sign a habitable Mars was possible. Beyond the riverbed discovery, Curiosity has found that a nearby area called Yellowknife Bay used to be a giant lake, that the region had large deposits of groundwater, and that these environments persisted for millions of years. Taken together, these discoveries reveal that a potentially life-supporting environment existed long enough that even complex life could have evolve.

Following an ambitious descent through Mars' tenuous atmosphere in August 2012, Curiosity has been slowly but deliberately trundling around a 96-mile-wide impact crater in search of evidence that the seemingly barren planet may have been hospitable to life in the distant past. Curiosity has spent the entirety of its operational life exploring Gale Crater, which, based on geological evidence collected by the rover back in 2013, once played host to an ancient freshwater lake. The discovery was met with a chorus of excitement, as the presence of water is considered one of the key ingredients needed for the emergence of microbial life. This is just one example of the countless insights into the Red Planet's geological and atmospheric environment afforded by the impressive scientific capabilities of the Curiosity rover. A Martian day, known as a Sol, is just a little longer than its equivalent on Earth, lasting roughly 24 hours and 37 minutes. Curiosity has racked up an impressive tally of Sols on the Red Planet, but it still has a ways to go if it's going to surpass NASA's Opportunity rover, which is currently enjoying its 5,035 sol on the Martian surface. Whilst Curiosity is starting to show signs of wear and tear from its arduous exploration of the Martian surface, the stoic rover has plenty of life in it yet. The next stint of Curiosity's marathon mission will see it continue to ascend sloping terrain in order to reach a number of clay-rich rocks, and use a new drilling technique to take samples for its suite of scientific instruments. Curiosity's science team is particularly excited about reaching and sampling the rocks, as the formation of the clay minerals in these rocks requires the presence of water. Examining these samples could provide clues as to how long water may have persisted on the surface of the Red Planet, and the potential of the ancient Martian environment to harbor life.

NASA's Curiosity Mars rover bored 2 inches into a rock on Sunday, grabbing powdered Red Planet samples for the first time in more than 18 months, agency officials said. Curiosity's drill, which sits at the end of the robot's 7-foot-long robotic arm, had been sidelined since late 2016, when a motor that extends two stabilizing posts on each side of the drill bit stopped working. Since then, engineers have been devising potential workarounds and testing them at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages Curiosity's mission. The most promising of these alternate drilling techniques keeps the drill bit extended beyond the stabilizing posts and then pushes it into the rock using force provided by the robotic arm. This method passed a multitude of tests here on Earth, and now it's aced its first bona fide run on Mars, on a rock target called \"Duluth,\" mission team members said. \"The team used tremendous ingenuity to devise a new drilling technique and implement it on another planet,\" Curiosity deputy project manager Steve Lee, of JPL, said in a statement. \"Those are two vital inches of innovation from 60 million miles 97 million kilometers away. We're thrilled that the result was so successful.\" Curiosity demonstrated the new technique in a limited fashion earlier this year, boring about 0.5 inches into a different Mars rock. But that hole wasn't deep enough to allow the rover to grab samples, NASA officials said. Drilling is a vital part of Curiosity's $2.5 billion mission, which is investigating Mars' past potential to host life and how the Red Planet's climate has changed over time. Curiosity's analyses of drilled rock samples have allowed the rover team to determine that the robot's landing site, the floor of the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater, hosted a habitable lake-and- stream system for long stretches billions of years ago. The car-size Curiosity analyzed those samples using two high-tech mini- laboratories on its body. The rover used a specially designed instrument to transfer powder from the drill to those instruments &mdash but that instrument won't work with the drill bit permanently extended, as it is in the new technique. The mission team thinks Curiosity can sort of sprinkle collected powder from the drill bit into the analytical instruments, but that method will have to be tested and demonstrated on the Red Planet. And that's just part of the work that remains to be done, mission team members stressed. \"We've been developing this new drilling technique for over a year, but our job isn't done once a sample has been collected on Mars,\" Tom Green, a JPL systems engineer who helped develop Curiosity's new drilling method, said in the same statement. \"With each new test, we closely examine the data to look for improvements we can make and then head back to our testbed to iterate on the process.\" Curiosity is currently climbing up through the foothills of the 3.4-mile-high Mount Sharp, which rises from Gale Crater's center.

That storm, which covered as much area as North America and Russia combined as of today, has engulfed the golf-cart-size Opportunity rover, plunging its environs into perpetual darkness. The solar-powered Opportunity has therefore temporarily ceased science operations. A recent photo by Curiosity suggests that dust may be encroaching a bit on its locale, the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater. But Curiosity is nuclear-powered, so a drop in sunlight isn't nearly as concerning to its handlers. Still, the Curiosity team is trying to monitor the storm. \"To measure dust in the atmosphere, we'll first point Mastcam towards the sun and take a tau measurement, which lets us determine the optical depth vertically,\" mission team member Rachel Kronyak wrote in an update on Friday. \"Then we'll take a Mastcam image of the crater rim to determine line-of-sight extinction, which is directly related to the amount of dust present. ENV will also take a few movies with Navcam to assess clouds, wind direction, and to look for dust devils,\" Kronyak added. This is not the first major dust storm weathered by Opportunity, which landed on the Red Planet in January 2004: An even larger storm forced the rover to stand down for two weeks in 2007. But the dust surrounding Opportunity now is much thicker than it was during that previous storm, mission team members have said. Opportunity beamed a message to its handlers on Sunday, which is a good sign; it shows the rover still has a decent amount of battery power left. Mission team members have a delicate balancing act ahead if the dust storm persists; they'll need to run Opportunity's heaters enough to keep the rover from freezing, but not so much that they run out its batteries. And Martian cold can kill. Opportunity's twin, Spirit, which also touched down on the Red Planet in January 2004, apparently froze to death after getting stuck in thick sand in 2010.

Dust darkens the sky above Curiosity and peppers the six-wheeled robot's deck. There's been a lot of dirt in the Martian atmosphere since late May, when a dust storm kicked up near Curiosity's older, smaller cousin, Opportunity. This flare-up intensified rapidly, blocking sunlight to the solar-powered Opportunity, which went silent on June 10. By June 20, the storm had grown into a planet-girding maelstrom. The dust storm ceased intensifying in late July, and it continues to die down. Opportunity still hasn't made a peep, but NASA officials have expressed optimism that they could end up hearing from the venerable rover before too much longer. Curiosity is nuclear-powered, so the dust storm hasn't affected its activities too much. But the 1-ton rover has been working through some other issues lately.

These failures don't reflect on the effectiveness of Curiosity's new, workaround drilling technique, which the mission team adopted after a key drill component failed in late 2016. The new method works quite well, Curiosity team members said; the rocks the rover tried to drill were just superhard. The hardness may be the result of long-ago groundwater flows, which spread a sort of cement throughout some of the sediments that came to comprise Vera Rubin Ridge, Curiosity principal investigator Ashwin Vasavada, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a NASA statement. Vera Rubin Ridge sits on the flanks of Mount Sharp, the 3.4-mile-high mountain that rises from the center of the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater. The foothills of Mount Sharp have been Curiosity's prime science destination since before the rover launched; mission team members were always keen to have the rover climb through those foothills, reading a history of Mars' changing environmental conditions in the rocks as it goes. The mission team plans to conduct two more drilling operations on Vera Rubin Ridge this month. If all goes according to plan, Curiosity will climb off the ridge in October, headed for clay- and sulfate-bearing deposits higher up on Mount Sharp, NASA officials said.

The mysterious issue, which cropped up Saturday night, prevents the rover from beaming to Earth much of the science and engineering information stored in its memory, Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, wrote in an update today. But Curiosity remains otherwise healthy, he said. For example, the rover can still relay real-time data about its status. \"Engineers are expanding the details the rover transmits in these real-time data to better diagnose the issue,\" Vasavada wrote. \"Because the amount of data coming down is limited, it might take some time for the engineering team to diagnose the problem.\" The rover team has turned off all of Curiosity's science instruments while engineers investigate the glitch. Mission team members are also preparing to fire up the rover's backup computer, in case they need it to diagnose the issue with the main computer, Vasavada wrote. The backup, which is identical to the main computer, has proved its mettle before. It served as Curiosity's primary computer for the rover's first 200 sols on the Red Planet before experiencing issues of its own, which have since been fixed, Vasavada noted. While mission engineers work on the current problem, the Curiosity science team will study the data the rover has already gathered at Vera Rubin Ridge, in the foothills of Mars' 3.4-mile-high Mount Sharp.

That hole is its 18th successful drilling assignment, according to NASA. It targeted a type of rock geologists with the mission have been eyeing for more than a month, but failed to successfully drill at a previous site. The drill was out of commission between late 2016 and this May as engineers addressed a problem with the instrument. But the rover had better luck at the new site, nicknamed Highfield. Curiosity is now analyzing the powder it was able to produce, which should tell scientists more about the rock at the site. The rover will also be watching how the little pile moves over time, which essentially creates weather observations by tracking wind movement, according to NASA. It's a particularly interesting time for weather observations on Mars because Curiosity's robotic companion, Opportunity, remains silent on the opposite side of the planet after a global dust storm earlier this year. Scientists hope that a seasonal weather phenomenon known as dust devils will be able to clear any lingering dust off Opportunity's solar panels and help it return to normal operations. In order to reach the new science site, Curiosity had to drive about 197 feet, according to NASA. The journey comes a month after engineers running the rover were forced to switch Curiosity to its back-up brain after a computer glitch occured on Sept. 15. Engineers are still trying to figure out what went wrong on the computer the rover had been relying on before the switch. Although the rover doesn't need both computers operating at once, they do want to repair the problem and switch back because the offline computer has more memory.

The eclipses were captured by the solar filters on the Curiosity's Mast Camera that allows it to stare directly at the Sun. Phobos, which is about 11.5 km across, was imaged on March 26, while Deimos, which is about 2.3 km across, was photographed on March 17, NASA said in a statement on Thursday. Phobos does not completely cover the Sun, so it would be considered an annular eclipse. Because Deimos is so small compared to the disk of the Sun, scientists would say it's transiting the Sun. In addition to capturing each moon crossing in front of the Sun, one of Curiosity's Navigation Cameras also observed the shadow of Phobos on March 25. As the moon's shadow passed over the rover during sunset, it momentarily darkened the light. These events also help make Mars relatable, said Mark Lemmon of Texas A&M University. \"Eclipses, sunrises and sunsets and weather phenomena all make Mars real to people, as a world both like and unlike what they see outside, not just a subject in a book,\" he added. Curiosity, which landed on Mars in 2012, was designed to assess whether Mars ever had an environment able to support small life forms called microbes. In other words, its mission is to determine the planet's \"habitability\". Solar eclipses have been seen many times by Curiosity and other rovers in the past. Until now, there have been eight observations of Deimos eclipsing the Sun from either Spirit, Opportunity or Curiosity; there have been about 40 observations of Phobos. There's still a margin of uncertainty in the orbits of both Martian moons, but that shrinks with every eclipse that's viewed from the Red Planet's surface, the team said. \"More observations over time help pin down the details of each orbit,\" Lemmon said. \"Those orbits change all the time in response to the gravitational pull of Mars, Jupiter or even each Martian moon pulling on the other.\" ", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/science/curiosity-rover-sends-images-of-solar-eclipses-caused-by-mars-2-moons-2018476"}, {"title": "Curiosity Tastes First Sample in 'Clay-Bearing Unit'", "date": "2019-04-11", "content": "Scientists working with NASA's Curiosity Mars rover have been excited to explore a region called \"the clay-bearing unit\" since before the spacecraft launched. Now, the rover has finally tasted its first sample from this part of Mount Sharp. Curiosity drilled a piece of bedrock nicknamed \"Aberlady\" on Saturday, April 6, and delivered the sample to its internal mineralogy lab on Wednesday, April 10. The rover's drill chewed easily through the rock, unlike some of the tougher targets it faced nearby on Vera Rubin Ridge. It was so soft, in fact, that the drill didn't need to use its percussive technique, which is helpful for snagging samples from harder rock. This was the mission's first sample obtained using only rotation of the drill bit. \"Curiosity has been on the road for nearly seven years,\" said Curiosity Project Manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Finally drilling at the clay-bearing unit is a major milestone in our journey up Mount Sharp.\" Scientists are eager to analyze the sample for traces of clay minerals because they usually form in water. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spied a strong clay \"signal\" here long before Curiosity landed in 2012. Pinpointing the source of that signal could help the science team understand if a wetter Martian era shaped this layer of Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall mountain Curiosity has been climbing. Curiosity has discovered clay minerals in mudstones all along its journey. These mudstones formed as river sediment settled within ancient lakes nearly 3.5 billion years ago. As with water elsewhere on Mars, the lakes eventually dried up. The clay beacon seen from space brought the rover here, but the region clearly has several other stories to tell. Now that Curiosity is searching this area, scientists can peer around as geological tourists, finding a landscape both ancient and new. There are several kinds of bedrock and sand, including active sand ripples that have shifted in the past year. Pebbles are scattered everywhere - are they eroding from the local bedrock? Several eye-catching landmarks, such as \"Knockfarril Hill,\" stick out as well. \"Each layer of this mountain is a puzzle piece,\" said Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of JPL. \"They each hold clues to a different era in Martian history. We're excited to see what this first sample tells us about the ancient environment, especially about water.\" The Aberlady sample will give the team a starting point for thinking about the clay-bearing unit. They plan to drill several more times over the course of the next year. That will help them understand what makes this region different from the ridge behind it and an area with a sulfate signal up higher on the mountain.

Two samples the rover recently drilled at rock targets called \"Aberlady\" and \"Kilmarie\" have revealed the highest amounts of clay minerals ever found during the mission. Both drill targets appear in a new selfie taken by the rover on May 12, 2019, the 2,405th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. This clay-enriched region, located on the side of lower Mount Sharp, stood out to NASA orbiters before Curiosity landed in 2012. Clay often forms in water, which is essential for life; Curiosity is exploring Mount Sharp to see if it had the conditions to support life billions of years ago. The rover's mineralogy instrument, called CheMin, provided the first analyses of rock samples drilled in the clay-bearing unit. CheMin also found very little hematite, an iron oxide mineral that was abundant just to the north, on Vera Rubin Ridge. Other than proof that there was a significant amount of water once in Gale Crater, what these new findings mean for the region is still up for debate. It's likely that the rocks in the area formed as layers of mud in ancient lakes - something Curiosity also found lower on Mount Sharp. Water interacted with sediment over time, leaving an abundance of clay in the rocks there. Amid this new drilling and analyzing, Curiosity took a break to watch some clouds - all in the name of science. The rover used its black-and-white Navigation Cameras to snap images of drifting clouds on May 7 and May 12, 2019, sols 2400 and 2405.

Methane is an odorless, colorless gas that can be produced by simple geological processes as well as by microbes and other living organisms, so the new methane spike doesn't definitively prove that life exists or once existed on Mars. \"While increased methane levels measured by @MarsCuriosity are exciting, as possible indicators for life, it's important to remember this is an early science result,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the science mission directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington, said in a tweet on Saturday. NASA said Curiosity scientists needed more time to analyze the new findings and to conduct additional methane observations. A spokesperson for the agency declined a request for more information. \"It's interesting, but we should wait a bit to be sure the data are confirmed,\" Dorothy Oehler, a senior scientist with the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, said of the methane spike in an email to NBC News MACH. Methane seeps from certain types of rocks on Earth and the same types exist on Mars, she said, \"so while we cannot exclude a microbial origin for the methane peaks on Mars, that would not be necessary to explain the detections to date.\" Major sources of methane on Earth include the production and distribution of fossil fuels; cattle and other domestic livestock, which produce methane during the digestive process; and the decomposition of waste in landfills and wastewater treatment plants. The rover's laser spectrometer device detected the methane while the car-size rover was parked at the Teal Ridge site within Gale Crater, a 96-mile-wide dry lake bed that was created millions of years ago by an asteroid impact. Curiosity was sent to the crater in part because its watery past makes it a likely spot to find evidence of past life on Mars. Previously, Curiosity detected carbon-containing molecules in ancient sediments on Mars as well as seasonal shifts in the levels of atmospheric methane.

It has traveled a total of 13 miles and ascended 1,207 feet to its current location. Along the way, Curiosity discovered Mars had the conditions to support microbial life in the ancient past, among other things. And the rover is far from done, having just drilled its 22nd sample from the Martian surface. It has a few more years before its nuclear power system degrades enough to significantly limit operations. After that, careful budgeting of its power will allow the rover to keep studying the Red Planet. Curiosity is now halfway through a region scientists call the \"clay-bearing unit\" on the side of Mount Sharp, inside of Gale Crater. Billions of years ago, there were streams and lakes within the crater. Water altered the sediment deposited within the lakes, leaving behind lots of clay minerals in the region. That clay signal was first detected from space by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter a few years before Curiosity launched. \"This area is one of the reasons we came to Gale Crater,\" said Kristen Bennett of the U.S. Geological Survey, one of the co-leads for Curiosity's clay-unit campaign. \"We've been studying orbiter images of this area for 10 years, and we're finally able to take a look up close.\" Rock samples that the rover has drilled here have revealed the highest amounts of clay minerals found during the mission. But Curiosity has detected similarly high amounts of clay on other parts of Mount Sharp, including in areas where MRO didn't detect clay. That's led scientists to wonder what is causing the findings from orbit and the surface to differ. The science team is thinking through possible reasons as to why the clay minerals here stood out to MRO. The rover encountered a \"parking lot full of gravel and pebbles\" when it first entered the area, said the campaign's other co-lead, Valerie Fox of Caltech. One idea is that the pebbles are the key: Although the individual pebbles are too small for MRO to see, they may collectively appear to the orbiter as a single clay signal scattered across the area. Dust also settles more readily over flat rocks than it does over the pebbles; that same dust can obscure the signals seen from space. The pebbles were too small for Curiosity to drill into, so the science team is looking for other clues to solve this puzzle. Curiosity exited the pebble parking lot back in June and started to encounter more complex geologic features. It stopped to take a 360-degree panorama at an outcrop called \"Teal Ridge.\" More recently, it took detailed images of \"Strathdon,\" a rock made of dozens of sediment layers that have hardened into a brittle, wavy heap. Unlike the thin, flat layers associated with lake sediments Curiosity has studied, the wavy layers in these features suggest a more dynamic environment. Wind, flowing water or both could have shaped this area. Both Teal Ridge and Strathdon represent changes in the landscape. \"We're seeing an evolution in the ancient lake environment recorded in these rocks,\" said Fox. \"It wasn't just a static lake. It's helping us move from a simplistic view of Mars going from wet to dry. Instead of a linear process, the history of water was more complicated.\" Curiosity is discovering a richer, more complex story behind the water on Mount Sharp - a process Fox likened to finally being able to read the paragraphs in a book - a dense book, with pages torn out, but a fascinating tale to piece together.

Curiosity has occupied this crater and studied it for seven years. The finding supports the theory that Mars became arid and dry after the crater was formed, approximately 3.5 billion years ago. The findings have implications for understanding how Mars evolved and became the dry and cold planet it is today, as well as its past habitability, as salt water bodies on Earth support abundant forms of life. The study has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience this week. The research, led by a team from the California Institute of Technology or Caltech, discovered that exposed sedimentary rock in the 150 km-wide Gale Crater, called the Sutton Island, was enriched heavily with sulphate salts. These salts have been detected before on the crater floor, but not in such high concentrations. The salts found in the 150m-tall rock formation were calcium sulphate and magnesium sulphate. The researchers concluded that the salt was probably deposited along the edges of the crater's basin, where the water was shallow, and via streams that ran along the crater walls. They also speculate that the deposits might have come from multiple ponds in the crater. The immediate implication of the findings is that the lake could have been habitable, as the environment would have been very similar to that of salt water lakes on Earth. Sulphur also makes up an important component of life. \"We went to Gale Crater because it preserves this unique record of a changing Mars,\" said lead author William Rapin of Caltech. \"Understanding when and how the planet's climate started evolving is a piece of another puzzle: When and how long was Mars capable of supporting microbial life at the surface?\" Ancient upheavals. Curiosity has been steadily climbing the Gale Crater, and as it examines the rock it is on, the concentration of salts has changed. At the bottom of the crater, where it landed, Curiosity discovered evidence of sediments that were from a freshwater lake, with no salt. But as it moved higher, the sediments started displaying varying concentrations of salt. This indicates that the crater periodically dried out for salts to precipitate out, much like sea water evaporating and leaving behind salt. Gale Crater in the past would have experienced variations in its water composition, where the lake alternated between freshwater and brine. These \"geochemical fingerprints\", as the researchers describe the findings, show glimpses into the kind of changes in climate that life would have had to deal with as Mars lost its atmosphere and became dry, most likely owing to changes in its axial tilt. As Curiosity climbs higher, the researchers expect to learn more about how these fluctuations occurred and how the process of loss of water took place.

But Curiosity also stuck its nose in the air for a big sniff to understand the Martian atmosphere. So far, this sniffing has resulted in some findings that scientists are still trying to understand. Earlier this year, the rover's tunable laser spectrometer, called SAM, which stands for Sample Analysis at Mars, detected the largest amount of methane ever measured during its mission. SAM has also found that over time, oxygen behaves in a way that can't be explained by any chemical process scientists currently understand. SAM has had plenty of time - about six years - to sniff and analyze the atmospheric composition on Mars. The data revealed that at the surface, 95% of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, followed by 2.6% molecular nitrogen, 1.9% argon, 0.16% oxygen and 0.06% carbon monoxide. Like Earth, Mars goes through its seasons; over the course of a year, the air pressure changes. This happens when the carbon dioxide gas freezes in winter at the poles, causing the air pressure to lower. It rises again in the spring and summer, redistributing across Mars as the carbon dioxide evaporates. In relation to the carbon monoxide, nitrogen and argon also follow similar dips and peaks. But oxygen didn't. Surprisingly, the oxygen actually rose by a peak increase of 30% in the spring and summer before dropping back to normal in the fall. Given the amount of time Curiosity has been monitoring the atmosphere, it was able to detect that this pattern repeated, albeit with varying amounts of oxygen. The variation suggests that the oxygen is being created by something, then taken away. \"The first time we saw that, it was just mind boggling,\" said Sushil Atreya, study author on a new paper about the oxygen levels and professor of climate and space sciences at the University of Michigan. The study published Tuesday in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. In order to rule out errors, the scientists checked to be sure SAM was operating properly, but found no issues. \"We're struggling to explain this,\" said Melissa Trainer, study author and planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"The fact that the oxygen behavior isn't perfectly repeatable every season makes us think that it's not an issue that has to do with atmospheric dynamics. It has to be some chemical source and sink that we can't yet account for.\" It relates back to the methane mystery. The June reading indicated 21 parts per billion units by volume, or ppbv. That means of the volume of air on Mars being assessed, one billionth of the volume of air is methane. So why is this unusually large amount of methane so interesting? On Earth, microbial life is a key source of methane. But NASA also warned that expectations of life should be managed due to the fact that interactions between rocks and water can also create methane, and Mars has water and an abundance of rocks. \"With our current measurements, we have no way of telling if the methane source is biology or geology, or even ancient or modern,\" said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. This isn't the first time methane has been detected on Mars by Curiosity. Over the course of its mission since landing in August 2012, Curiosity has detected methane many times and studies have been written about how the gas levels actually appear to rise and fall depending on the season. It can spike as much as 60% during the summer. Could the two be connected to a similar chemistry since they're fluctuating the same way? \"We're beginning to see this tantalizing correlation between methane and oxygen for a good part of the Mars year,\" Atreya said. \"I think there's something to it. I just don't have the answers yet. Nobody does.\" The origin of the methane or oxygen won't be evident because the rover doesn't have any instruments that can trace or determine the source. And while both oxygen and methane can be created from biological sources, they can also arise due to chemistry, like the interaction of water and rocks. \"We have not been able to come up with one process yet that produces the amount of oxygen we need, but we think it has to be something in the surface soil that changes seasonally because there aren't enough available oxygen atoms in the atmosphere to create the behavior we see,\" said Timothy McConnochie, study co-author and assistant research scientist at the University of Maryland. The scientists wanted to share their findings in the hopes that Martian experts may be able to help determine what process is creating these increases. \"This is the first time where we're seeing this interesting behavior over multiple years. We don't totally understand it,\" Trainer said. \"For me, this is an open call to all the smart people out there who are interested in this: See what you can come up with.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/world/curiosity-rover-oxygen-scn/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA Curiosity rover spots fascinating 'little round items' on Mars", "date": "2019-12-10", "content": "This might look like a chocolate-chip cookie, but it's actually a zoomed-in view of the ground on Mars where some intriguing rounded formations appear. NASA's Curiosity rover snapped the fascinating view on Dec. 5. Planetary geologist and Curiosity team member Susanne Schwenzer described the nodule-like rocks as \"little round items\" in a rover mission update on Monday. Schwenzer suggested the smooth shapes \"could be due to diagenesis or more generally water-rock interaction.\" Diagenesis refers to the alteration processes that occur after sediment is deposited. Curiosity has been investigating a clay-rich area of Mars. Data gathered there is helping scientists delve into the history of water on Mars. If you're trying to figure out the scale here, think tiny. The ChemCam Remote Micro-Imager is capable of taking super-close-up images. The ChemCam team analyzes soil and rock composition and investigates weathering processes. Curiosity has been gifting researchers with a diverse array of rocks lately. \"The rich workspace included bedrock, pebbly areas and a brighter float rock of a kind which has been observed frequently in the vicinity,\" Schwenzer wrote. NASA has spotted some wonderfully smooth pebbles on Mars before, including one in 2017 that looked like a tiny cannonball.

The problem isn't a very good one either because Curiosity is refusing to move. NASA has released a new report that reveals that Curiosity has temporarily stopped moving. So why did this happen? Curiosity is equipped with a series of safety regulations that have been implemented into the rover to ensure its safety when traversing the dangerous landscape of Mars. Curiosity measures the surroundings relative to its body before making a move, and some of these measurements are the current altitude, surrounding rock formation, slope steepness, etc. Popular Now: NASA's Webb telescope catches a giant spider out in deep space Before any movement is made by Curiosity, all of these measurements have to be evaluated and deemed 'safe'. If one of these safety checks are calculated to be 'not safe' then Curiosity won't turn on its motor and remain still, which is exactly what the rover has just done. In the report, NASA says that \" Curiosity lost its orientation\" because \"Some knowledge of its attitude was not quite right, so it couldn't make the essential safety evaluation** \".

The issue sidelined the rover for a brief time, but the golf cart-sized robot is back to roaming the red planet. In rover speak, \"attitude\" doesn't mean Curiosity is being sassy, but rather it refers to the robot's position in space. Curiosity needs to know where it and its robotic arm are at all times. This helps keep the rover safe. If Curiosity fails to keep track of its attitude, it could accidentally point one of its cameras towards the sun or even damage an instrument by hitting it on a nearby rock or boulder. \"Partway through its last set of activities, Curiosity lost its orientation. Some knowledge of its attitude was not quite right, so it couldn't make the essential safety evaluation,\" Dawn Sumner, a planetary geologist and Curiosity team member wrote in a mission update on Monday. \"Thus, Curiosity stopped moving, freezing in place until its knowledge of its orientation can be recovered,\" she added. \"Curiosity kept sending us information, so we know what happened and can develop a recovery plan.\" Curiosity has explored the Martian surface since 2012, and over the course of its mission, the rover has bounced back from numerous glitches-this was no exception. Thanks to the robot's handlers, a plan was quickly implemented and Curiosity started moving again. Their plan was to manually send the robot its location information. Soon after, Curiosity was back in action. \"We learned this morning that plan was successful and Curiosity was ready for science once more!\" said Scott Guzewich, mission team member and atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, wrote in a subsequent update. This isn't the first time the rover dealt with issues. Curiosity has overcome multiple glitches and setbacks during its time on Mars. But thanks to a robust design and a team of highly-skilled engineers, the rover has been able to work through the various issues that have popped up. In fact, Curiosity originally had just a two-year mission, but has performed so well, that the six-wheeled rover is in its seventh year. The rover landed inside Gale Crater, a 96-mile-wide crater in August 2012, and was tasked with assessing the region's habitability. Did life once flourish in this spot? So far, Curiosity has not found direct evidence of past life on Mars, but the rolling scientist did discover that the spot was once home to a lake and stream system, some time in Mars's past. Currently, the rover is exploring the foothills of Mount Sharp, a 3.4-mile- high mountain jetting up from the crater's center. Here, the rover will look for clues about Mars's ancient climate and how it changed over millions of years. Right now, Curiosity is the only functioning rover on the red planet's surface. NASA's storied Opportunity rover was shut down following a planet- wide dust storm that blocked out the lift-sustaining sunshine the rover needed to power its batteries. In July, NASA will be sending its next rover-a souped up version of Curiosity-to Mars. Designed to search for signs of life, the Mars 2020 rover will arrive on the red planet in March 2021. Landing in Jezero Crater, the rover will bag up samples for return to Earth at a later time. But that's not all. The European Space Agency is teaming with Russia's Roscosmos to send its own rover to Mars. The Rosalind Franklin, ExoMars rover will also look for signs of past life on Mars.

Composed of more than 1,000 images taken during the 2019 Thanksgiving holiday and carefully assembled over the ensuing months, the composite contains 1.8 billion pixels of Martian landscape. The rover's Mast Camera, or Mastcam, used its telephoto lens to produce the panorama; meanwhile, it relied on its medium-angle lens to produce a lower-resolution, nearly 650-million-pixel panorama that includes the rover's deck and robotic arm. Both panoramas showcase \"Glen Torridon,\" a region on the side of Mount Sharp that Curiosity is exploring. They were taken between November 24 and December 1, when the mission team was out for the Thanksgiving holiday. Sitting still with few tasks to do while awaiting the team to return and provide its next commands, the rover had a rare chance to image its surroundings from the same vantage point several days in a row. It required more than 6 1/2 hours over the four days for Curiosity to capture the individual shots. Mastcam operators programmed the complex task list, which included pointing the rover's mast and making sure the images were in focus. To ensure consistent lighting, they confined imaging to between noon and 2 p.m. local Mars time each day. \"While many on our team were at home enjoying turkey, Curiosity produced this feast for the eyes,\" said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which leads the Curiosity rover mission. \"This is the first time during the mission we've dedicated our operations to a stereo 360-degree panorama.\" In 2013, Curiosity produced a 1.3-billion-pixel panorama using both Mastcam cameras; its black-and-white Navigation Cameras, or Navcams, provided images of the rover itself.

The rover landed in Gale Crater in 2012. The 96-mile-wide crater was once the site of an ancient lake. Curiosity has returned evidence that not was this once a freshwater oasis, but it could have contained microbial life. The roaming science lab has shown that dried up mud in the region contains organic molecules. Now this doesn't mean that Curiosity found life. But it does mean that these molecules could have a biological origin. Or maybe not. The mud samples were collected by the rover back in 2018 and scientists have been busy analyzing them. Scientists at Washington State University believe they have identified a group of interesting molecules, called thiophenes. Thiophenes are particularly interesting because while they form through physical processes unrelated to living organisms, their ingredients could in fact have a biological origin. The molecules are composed of hydrocarbons and sulfur; when temperatures are greater than 248 \u00b0Fahrenheit, they react through a process called thermochemical sulphate reduction . On Earth thiopenes are found in incredibly interesting areas: crude oil deposits and in coal. So how do they form on Mars? This is the question researchers have tried to answer. \"We identified several biological pathways for thiophenes that seem more likely than chemical ones, but we still need proof,\" said astrobiologist Dirk Schulze-Makuch of Washington State University. It's entirely possible that sometime in Mars' past, when the planet was warmer and wetter, that bacteria and other life forms could have thrived in its surface. They may have even left their mark in the mud. As such, it's easy to assume these molecules are biological but we can't just assume. We need hard evidence. According to Schulze-Makuch, the presence of thiophenes has a number of explanations, not all of which are biological. For instance, the thiophenes could have been delivered by meteorites bombarding the planet, or they could form from geological processes like volcanism. Mars is seismically active and hosts a number of volcanoes, so this could be a likely explanation. Here's where the next-generation Mars rovers come into play. Both NASA and the European Space Agency are sending rovers to Mars this summer, in search of life. These two rovers are equipped with specialized instruments that will be able to better analyze samples on the Martian surface. But Schulze-Makuch thinks it will take sending people to Mars before we will find any definitive proof of life. \"I think the proof will really require that we actually send people there, and an astronaut looks through a microscope and sees a moving microbe,\" he said.

And before doing that, the rover took a selfie, capturing the scene just below Greenheugh. In front of the rover is a hole it drilled while sampling a bedrock target called \"Hutton.\" The entire selfie is a 360-degree panorama stitched together from 86 images relayed to Earth. The selfie captures the rover about 11 feet below the point where it climbed onto the crumbling pediment. Curiosity finally reached the top of the slope March 6. It took three drives to scale the hill, the second of which tilted the rover 31 degrees - the most the rover has ever tilted on Mars and just shy of the now-inactive Opportunity rover's 32-degree tilt record, set in 2016. Curiosity took the selfie on Feb. 26, 2020. Since 2014, Curiosity has been rolling up Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-tall mountain at the center of Gale Crater. Rover operators at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California carefully map out each drive to make sure Curiosity will be safe. The rover is never in danger of tilting so much that it would flip over - Curiosity's rocker-bogie wheel system enables it to tilt up to 45 degrees safely - but the steep drives do cause the wheels to spin in place. **How Are Selfies Taken?** Before the climb, Curiosity used the black-and-white Navigation Cameras located on its mast to, for the first time, record a short movie of its \"selfie stick,\" otherwise known as its robotic arm. Curiosity's mission is to study whether the Martian environment could have supported microbial life billions of years ago. One tool for doing that is the Mars Hand Lens Camera, or MAHLI, located in the turret at the end of the robotic arm. This camera provides a close-up view of sand grains and rock textures, similarly to how a geologist uses a handheld magnifying glass for a closer look in the field on Earth. By rotating the turret to face the rover, the team can use MAHLI to show Curiosity. Because each MAHLI image covers only a small area, it requires many images and arm positions to fully capture the rover and its surroundings. \"We get asked so often how Curiosity takes a selfie,\" said Doug Ellison, a Curiosity camera operator at JPL. \"We thought the best way to explain it would be to let the rover show everyone from its own point of view just how it's done.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8631/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-takes-a-new-selfie-before-record-climb/?site=msl"}, {"title": "NASA's Curiosity Rover Takes a Selfie on Mars", "date": "2020-03-25", "content": "NASA's Curiosity rover recently set a record for the steepest hill it's ever climbed, and to commemorate the achievement, the rover took a selfie - naturally.

When the camera turns around, it's able to snap selfies of the rover in action. The rover is designed to be able to climb hills of up to 45 degrees, but sometimes its wheels get stuck during the ascent, according to NASA. But it was never in danger of tipping over.

Curiosity Rover is currently exploring the site known as Mary Anning where it is conducting drilling operations to explore the surface. Using a rock drill and its robotic arm, Curiosity has made three holes in the Mary Anning area from where it is collecting samples and analysing them.

In its update on Curiositys activities on Mars, Nasa has said, This past year, the rover has explored a region of Mount Sharp called Glen Torridon, which likely held lakes and streams billions of years ago. Scientists suspect this is why a high concentration of clay minerals and organic molecules was discovered there. Since 2012, Curiosity has been ascending Mount Sharp and the scientists have commanded the rover to further continue with its climb. Why the name Mary Anning. Nasa has said the site was named Mary Anning after a 19th-century English paleontologist whose discovery of marine reptile fossils were rejected at the time because she was a woman and belonged to the lower class. Scientists handling the Curiosity mission found it fit to name this area on Mars after Mary Anning because of the area's potential to reveal details about the ancient environment. Whats next for Curiosity. Scientists and engineers who command the Curiosity rover on Mars have been working from their homes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. After the Mary Anning expedition, Curiosity will continue its ascent of Mount Sharp. Nasa has said the Curiosity rover will next explore a layer of sulfate-laden rock that lies higher up the mountain. The team hopes to reach it in early 2021. Meanwhile, Nasa has launched another Mars mission Perseverance that kicked off from Earth in July 2020.

Previous work revealed that while Gale Crater's lakes were present and even after they dried out, groundwater moved below the surface, dissolving and transporting chemicals. After they were deposited and buried, some mudstone pockets experienced different conditions and processes due to interactions with these waters that changed the mineralogy. This process, known as \"diagenesis,\" often complicates or erases the soil's previous history and writes a new one. Diagenesis creates an underground environment that can support microbial life. In fact, some very unique habitats on Earth - in which microbes thrive - are known as \"deep biospheres.\" \"These are excellent places to look for evidence of ancient life and gauge habitability,\" said John Grotzinger, CheMin co-investigator and co-author at the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech, in Pasadena, California. \"Even though diagenesis may erase the signs of life in the original lake, it creates the chemical gradients necessary to support subsurface life, so we are really excited to have discovered this.\" By comparing the details of minerals from both samples, the team concluded that briny water filtering down through overlying sediment layers was responsible for the changes. Unlike the relatively freshwater lake present when the mudstones formed, the salty water is suspected to have come from later lakes that existed within an overall drier environment. Scientists believe these results offer further evidence of the impacts of Mars' climate change billions of years ago. They also provide more detailed information that is then used to guide the Curiosity rover's investigations into the history of the Red Planet. This information also will be utilized by NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover team as they evaluate and select rock samples for eventual return to Earth. \"We've learned something very important: There are some parts of the Martian rock record that aren't so good at preserving evidence of the planet's past and possible life,\" said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity project scientist and co- author at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"The fortunate thing is we find both close together in Gale Crater, and can use mineralogy to tell which is which.\" Curiosity is in the initial phase of investigating the transition to a \"sulfate-bearing unit,\" or rocks thought to have formed while Mars' climate dried out.

Although the rover found no such evidence, it suggests that future missions to other worlds could use the same method. In March 2017, the rover scooped material from the Bagnold Dunes, a band of sand dunes stretching tens of kilometres on the surface. In December 2017, Curiosity transferred some of this material into its Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. SAM has 74 \"cups\", or holders, that are used to analyse Martian samples. Most are empty, with the samples in them heated by the rover to be studied, but nine contain solvents that can dissolve the samples, which allows us to better work out their compositions. The test in December 2017 saw some of these solvents used for the first time, to see whether this technique could be useful on other worlds. The results showed it could. After years of careful work on Earth to understand what they were seeing, Ma\u00ebva Millan at Georgetown University in Washington DC and her colleagues found evidence for organic molecules in the samples that would have been missed by the rover's regular analysis. While they didn't find any concrete evidence of life, such as amino acids, the results showed the benefits of these so-called \"wet chemistry derivatization\" experiments. \"We have proved that this experiment can work,\" says Millan. \"That means we can do this same experiment again on different minerals like clay and sulphates that can better preserve organic molecules.\" That will include further studies on the surface of Mars by Curiosity in regions that are more conducive to life. Its sister rover, Perseverance, is also looking for signs of life, but doesn't have the same \"wet chemistry\" equipment. The technique will be used on future missions, such as Europe's upcoming Rosalind Franklin Mars rover launching in 2022 and NASA's Dragonfly mission, a drone that will explore the surface of Saturn's moon Titan in 2036. \"Now we know we're able to make it work on the surface of another planet,\" says Millan.

None of the organic molecules identified in the sand hold unequivocal signs of life, but they do suggest the new technique, which didn't require the rover to drill, is an effective tool when it comes to searching for evidence of carbon- based molecules, which are important building blocks for life as we know it. The wet-lab experiment came about after Curiosity hit a figurative bump in the road while looking for signs of life on the red planet at the close of 2016. Just as the rover was preparing to sample the Martian rock at the base of Mt Sharp, its drill suddenly stopped working. Instead of putting a break on the mission until the issue could be fixed, researchers at NASA simply changed gears. Rather than pulverizing rock samples into powder, a bit of loose sand that had already been scooped up on Ogunquit Beach was introduced into Curiosity's 'wet chemistry lab'. This on-board laboratory includes just nine cups of solvent, which can only be used once each, so researchers have to be really picky about which samples they ultimately choose. Organic compounds within Martian rock are super challenging to detect, because once they are heated, they break up into simpler molecules. If these organic compounds, however, react with other chemicals first, they are more likely to enter a gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer for analysis without breaking down. Hence, Curiosity's nine cups of solvent. It's a cleverly designed system that enables us to quickly analyze soil on Mars from the comfort of our own planet. Yet in late 2016, it had never been put to the test. The team at NASA didn't expect the sand from Ogunquit to be organic rich, but they weren't sure they could keep drilling on the planet going forward, so it was worth a try. Breaking the first seal for the Ogunquit sand, researchers found several organic compounds including ammonia and benzoic acid. Some of the organic compounds had never been identified on Mars before. Now, a couple of years later, the results have been peer-reviewed and published. As mentioned above, the presence of these organic molecules doesn't definitively mean there was once life on Mars, and no amino-acid derivatives were detected in the sample. But what's exciting is that this new technique can now be used to look for signs of life, even without the ability to drill. \"This derivatization experiment on Mars has expanded the inventory of molecules present in Martian samples and demonstrated a powerful tool to further enable the search for polar organic molecules of biotic or prebiotic relevance,\" wrote the NASA research team, led by astrobiologist Ma\u00ebva Millan from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Georgetown University. In the end, it took over a year before engineers on Earth were able to fix Curiosity's drill and get it back in action, but by then, we knew the wet chemistry cups could work. By 2019, the second cup was ready to be used for a sample of clay- bearing rock from further up Mt Sharp. Other analyses are soon to follow, not only on Mars but also on Earth. NASA plans on conducting a mission in the 2030s to collect the rest of Curiosity's samples, so that they can be more carefully analyzed back on our own planet.

The rover has discovered a lake and streams and, two years into its mission, reached the base of Mount Sharp, which stands 5 miles (8 kilometers) tall in the center of the crater. In August, the rover arrived at a new region in its journey, one that is intriguing to scientists because of its mineral-rich rocks and materials that could reveal information about the planet's climate.

That's by no means certain, but it's a possibility. It's one of three different scenarios that experts think might have produced the carbon found in sediment in the Gale crater ), collected across nine years from August 2012 to July 2021. A total of 24 powder samples were heated by Curiosity to separate individual chemicals, revealing a wide variation in terms of the mix of carbon 12 and carbon 13 isotopes: the two stable carbon isotopes that can reveal how the carbon cycle may have changed over time. Part of the Martian landscape where samples were taken. What makes these variations particularly fascinating - some samples enriched with carbon 13, and some extremely depleted - is that they point to unconventional processes different to those created by the carbon cycle in Earth's modern era. \"The amounts of carbon 12 and carbon 13 in our Solar System are the amounts that existed at the formation of the Solar System,\" says geoscientist Christopher House from Pennsylvania State University. \"Both exist in everything, but because carbon 12 reacts more quickly than carbon 13, looking at the relative amounts of each in samples can reveal the carbon cycle.\" One explanation for the carbon signatures is a giant, molecular cloud of dust. The Solar System passes through one of these every couple of hundred million years or so, and the cooling effect it creates leaves carbon deposits in its wake. This is a plausible scenario, the team says, but one that needs more investigation. Alternatively, the conversion of CO2 to organic compounds through abiotic processes could explain what Curiosity has found - in this case, ultraviolet light might have been the trigger. It's something scientists have hypothesized about before, but again further study is required to confirm whether or not this is actually what's happening. That leaves the third explanation, which is that either ultraviolet light or microbes once upon a time converted methane produced by biological processes - that we're looking at carbon created as a result of life. As with the other two possibilities, we're going to need more surrounding evidence to know for sure, but there are some parallels on Earth. \"The samples extremely depleted in carbon 13 are a little like samples from Australia taken from sediment that was 2.7 billion years old,\" says House. \"Those samples were caused by biological activity when methane was consumed by ancient microbial mats, but we can't necessarily say that on Mars because it's a planet that may have formed out of different materials and processes than Earth.\" Curiosity's mission carries on, of course. The future discovery of the remains of microbial mats, or substantial methane plumes, or traces of long-lost glaciers would help the scientists figure out which one of these three explanations is most likely. For now though, we just don't know enough about Mars and its history to be able to come to any conclusions about how these carbon signatures came about. Further drilling is planned at the spot where many of these samples were collected in a month's time. Curiosity has recently been joined by the Perseverance rover, which is planning to return Martian rocks to Earth rather than experimenting on them in situ. Expect much more to be revealed by these two robotic explorers over the coming years. \"All three possibilities point to an unusual carbon cycle unlike anything on Earth today,\" says House. \"But we need more data to figure out which of these is the correct explanation. \"We are being cautious with our interpretation, which is the best course when studying another world.\" The research has been published in PNAS .

The rugged landscape inside Mars' Gale Crater has taken some substantial bites out of Curiosity's six aluminum wheels, as CNET recently pointed out. The damage looks dramatic, but don't panic; Curiosity should be able to keep trundling along for a while yet. \"The current predicted odometry remaining is expected to be sufficient to support Curiosity throughout the remainder of the mission,\" Andrew Good, a spokesman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages Curiosity's mission, told Space.com via email. The gouges and gashes on the rover's wheels \"always look nastier than they are,\" Good added. The car-sized Curiosity landed on Gale's floor in August 2012, on a mission to determine if the area could ever have supported microbial life. The robot soon answered that question, finding that Gale hosted a potentially habitable lake- and-stream system in the ancient past that likely persisted for millions of years at a time. Since September 2014, Curiosity has been climbing the flanks of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles into the sky from Gale's center. The rover is reading the rock layers as it goes, searching for clues about Mars' long-ago shift from a relatively warm and wet world to the frigid desert planet we know today. Curiosity has traveled a total of 16.86 miles on Mars to date, many of them across rugged, rocky terrain. The rover's wheels started showing signs of wear and tear relatively early in the mission_, spurring its handlers to take some mitigation measures - picking routes across gentler terrain when possible, for example, and eventually beaming up \"traction control\" software that adjusts Curiosity's speed depending on the type of ground it's traversing. Those measures seem to have worked, Good said, noting that the mission team recently started snapping wheel-inspection imagery every 3,300 feet of ground traveled rather than every 1,650 feet, as had been the norm. Curiosity's wheel-wear experiences helped shape the design of NASA's next Mars rover, Perseverance_, which touched down on the floor of Jezero Crater in February 2021. For example, Perseverance's wheels are slightly larger in diameter and have twice as many treads as those of Curiosity. In addition, the life-hunting, sample-caching Perseverance's treads are gently curved instead of chevron-shaped. And they don't spell out \"JPL\" in Morse code on the red dirt as the rover drives, like those of Curiosity were designed to do_.

The Curiosity rover_, which is exploring Mount Sharp, was climbing the southern side of a gentle slope called \"Greenheugh Pediment\" for most of March, where it encountered mostly rubbly sandstone. On March 18, the rover's team on Earth spotted unexpected terrain littered with wind-sharpened rocks, called ventifacts. In response, the drivers decided to turn the robotic explorer around, according to a statement from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, which leads the mission. Earlier in its mission on Mars_, Curiosity had encountered similar ventifacts that damaged the rover's wheels. However, the rover's recent rocky photos showed more ventifacts than the team has seen in Curiosity's nearly 10 years on the Red Planet, according to the statement. Ventifacts are composed of sandstone, which is the hardest type of rock Curiosity has encountered on Mars since landing in Gale Crater on Aug. 6, 2012. Given the features' scale-like appearance, scientists have nicknamed ventifacts \"gator-back\" terrain. Since the rover first encountered this type of hazardous terrain, the mission's team has worked to reduce wheel wear and relied on orbital imagery to chart safer routes for the rover to prevent it from driving over dangerous terrain. However, as Curiosity approached the southern side of Greenheugh Pediment - a 1.2 mile-wide sloping plain near the base of Mount Sharp - it saw the rocky terrain up-close, revealing to mission engineers just how hazardous the ventifacts are. \"It was obvious from Curiosity's photos that this would not be good for our wheels,\" Megan Lin, Curiosity project manager from JPL, said in the statement. \"It would be slow going, and we wouldn't have been able to implement rover- driving best practices.\" While the gator-back rocks wouldn't have been impassable, traversing the terrain would have increased wear and tear on the wheels, and threatened their longevity. Therefore, the team is charting a new course up Mount Sharp, the 3.4-mile-tall mountain that Curiosity has been ascending since 2014. Scientists had originally pointed the rover toward Greenheugh Pediment to better understand how the standalone feature formed. This area is also near Gediz Vallis Ridge, which planetary scientists believe was created by debris flowing down the mountain. Therefore, exploring the tricky rocks might have revealed new clues about material that originated at the mountain's uppermost reaches. \"From a distance, we can see car-sized boulders that were transported down from higher levels of Mount Sharp - maybe by water relatively late in Mars' wet era,\" Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity's project scientist at JPL, said in the statement. \"We don't really know what they are, so we wanted to see them up close.\" Instead, Curiosity will now climb down from the pediment, back to a safer area it has previously explored - a transition zone between clay-rich terrain and one with higher amounts of salt minerals called sulfates. This area helps scientists better understand Mars' ancient past, since the clay minerals would have formed when the mountain was wetter, whereas the salts would have formed as the planet's climate dried out over time, according to the statement. \"It was really cool to see rocks that preserved a time when lakes were drying up and being replaced by streams and dry sand dunes,\" Abigail Fraeman, Curiosity's deputy project scientist at JPL, said in the statement. \"I'm really curious to see what we find as we continue to climb on this alternate route.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/curiosity-rover-dodging-gator-back-terrain-photo"}, {"title": "NASA's Curiosity Rover Spotted a 'Doorway' on Mars", "date": "2022-05-13", "content": "NASA's Curiosity rover took a photo of a Lovecraftian feature on the surface of Mars last week: a seemingly rectangular and shadowy opening in the planet's exposed rock that looks as if it leads into the Martian underground.

While the grainy black-and-white image may have conspiracy theorists over the moon, it almost definitely doesn't show the entrance to an underground alien society. \"It's just the space between two fractures in a rock,\" Ashwin Vasavada told Gizmodo in a phone call today. Vasavada is a project scientist in the Mars Science Laboratory, and he said the formation is definitely not the entrance to a video game's dungeon level. \"We've been traversing through an area that has formed from ancient sand dunes,\" he said. These sand dunes were cemented together over time, creating the sandstone outcrops Curiosity is passing by. Advertisement Vasavada told us that the fracture is only about a foot tall and that, once these sand dunes were compacted together, they were buried and unburied over time as the sand on Mars' surface shifted. During this process, the sandstone was under varying pressure, causing it to buckle and fracture in different places. \"The fractures we see in this area are generally vertical,\" he explained. This particular doorway-shaped fracture likely formed in one of two ways. \"I think what we have here is either two vertical fractures, where the middle piece has been removed, or one vertical fracture, and the blocks have moved apart a little bit,\" Vasavada said.

Since then, Curiosity has driven nearly 18 miles and ascended 2,050 feet as it explores Gale Crater and the foothills of Mount Sharp within it. The rover has analyzed 41 rock and soil samples, relying on a suite of science instruments to learn what they reveal about Earth's rocky sibling. And it's pushed a team of engineers to devise ways to minimize wear and tear and keep the rover rolling: In fact, Curiosity's mission was recently extended for another three years, allowing it to continue among NASA's fleet of important astrobiological missions. A Bounty of Science. It's been a busy decade. Curiosity has studied the Red Planet's skies, capturing images of shining clouds and drifting moons. The rover's radiation sensor lets scientists measure the amount of high-energy radiation future astronauts would be exposed to on the Martian surface, helping NASA figure out how to keep them safe. But most important, Curiosity has determined that liquid water as well as the chemical building blocks and nutrients needed for supporting life were present for at least tens of millions of years in Gale Crater. The crater once held a lake, the size of which waxed and waned over time. Each layer higher up on Mount Sharp serves as a record of a more recent era of Mars' environment. Now, the intrepid rover is driving through a canyon that marks the transition to a new region, one thought to have formed as water was drying out, leaving behind salty minerals called sulfates. \"We're seeing evidence of dramatic changes in the ancient Martian climate,\" said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"The question now is whether the habitable conditions that Curiosity has found up to now persisted through these changes. Did they disappear, never to return, or did they come and go over millions of years?\" Curiosity has made striking progress up the mountain. Back in 2015, the team captured a \"postcard\" image of distant buttes. A mere speck within that image is a Curiosity-size boulder nicknamed \"Ilha Novo Destino\" - and, nearly seven years later, the rover trundled by it last month on the way to the sulfate-bearing region. The team plans to spend the next few years exploring the sulfate-rich area. Within it, they have targets in mind like the Gediz Vallis channel, which may have formed during a flood late in Mount Sharp's history, and large cemented fractures that show the effects of groundwater higher up the mountain. How to Keep a Rover on a Roll. What's Curiosity's secret to maintaining an active lifestyle at the ripe old age of 10? A team of hundreds of dedicated engineers, of course, working both in person at JPL and remotely from home. They catalog each and every crack in the wheels, test every line of computer code before it's beamed into space, and drill into endless rock samples in JPL's Mars Yard, ensuring Curiosity can safely do the same. \"As soon as you land on Mars, everything you do is based on the fact that there's no one around to repair it for 100 million miles,\" said Andy Mishkin, Curiosity's acting project manager at JPL. \"It's all about making intelligent use of what's already on your rover.\" Curiosity's robotic drilling process, for example, has been reinvented multiple times since landing. At one point, the drill was offline for more than a year as engineers redesigned its use to be more like a handheld drill. More recently, a set of braking mechanisms that allow the robotic arm to move or stay in place stopped working. Although the arm has been operating as usual since engineers engaged a set of spares, the team has also learned to drill more gently to preserve the new brakes. To minimize damage to the wheels, engineers keep an eye out for treacherous spots like the knife-edged \"gator-back\" terrain they recently discovered, and they developed a traction-control algorithm to help as well. The team has taken a similar approach to managing the rover's slowly diminishing power. Curiosity relies on a long-lived nuclear-powered battery rather than solar panels to keep on rolling. As the plutonium pellets in the battery decay, they generate heat that the rover converts into power. Because of the pellets' gradual decay, the rover can't do quite as much in a day as it did during its first year. Mishkin said the team is continuing to budget how much energy the rover uses each day, and has figured out which activities can be done in parallel to optimize the energy available to the rover. \"Curiosity is definitely doing more multitasking where it's safe to do so,\" Mishkin added. Through careful planning and engineering hacks, the team has every expectation the plucky rover still has years of exploring to ahead of it.
