We are delighted that Pratt & Whitney recently achieved Transport Canada type certification of its first PurePower Geared Turbofan\u2122 engine, the PW1500G engine that will power the CSeries aircraft, and we are now focusing on three key areas that will lead to our safety-of-flight permit: static airframe testing, building of flight test vehicles and on-the-ground testing,\" added Mr. Arcamone. Media and financial analysts will have the opportunity to get a first-hand look at the first CSeries flight test vehicle (FTV1), Complete Integrated Aircraft Systems Test Area (CIASTA) and various technology displays following today's program update at Bombardier's CSeries final assembly facility in Mirabel, Qu\u00e9bec. Extra capacity seating option: Bombardier also confirmed today that it has introduced an extra capacity seating option that will increase the CS300 aircraft seating to up to 160 passengers, providing customers with additional payload and range flexibility, as well as increased productivity. It also confirmed that Latvia-based airBaltic is one of these customers, having selected a 148-seat higher-density version. The CS300 aircraft's systems' capacity has been increased to accommodate a higher passenger count. The extra capacity seating option, which requires the addition of a second pair of over-wing exit doors, will be available both in-production and as a retrofit should customers need that flexibility in the future. \"Our main focus continues to be the development, optimization and marketing of the CSeries family of aircraft in the 100- to 149-seat market segment. The CSeries aircraft is a game-changer in a changing economic environment, and following keen customer interest and market trends, we have enhanced the productivity of the CS300 aircraft further by offering the extra capacity seating option,\" stated Mr. Arcamone. \"Specifically adapted for airlines looking at further increasing the productivity of their aircraft, the extra capacity seating option enables the CS300 aircraft to offer the highest seating capacity in its market segment, with the best-in-class seat mile costs and comfort. We are pleased that airBaltic has selected to purchase this new option for its CS300 aircraft,\" added Mr. Arcamone. \"We are delighted to select the extra capacity seating option and the additional pair of over-wing emergency exit doors.

Air Baltic has chosen a 148-seat version of the larger of the pair of CSeries narrowbodies, stretched two feet beyond its original specified length of 125 feet to accommodate the extra capacity. Air Baltic holds a firm order for 10 CS300s and purchase rights on another 10. In an interview with AIN following the announcement, CSeries program head Rob Dewar explained that Bombardier added the extra length to the center fuselage section, the only part of the CS300's aluminum-lithium barrel that doesn't use part numbers common to the CS100. However, said Dewar, Bombardier also needed to apply some of the modifications needed for the CS300 to the CS100, thereby contributing to its six-month delay. Other changes include the addition of a pair of over-wing emergency exit doors to satisfy certification requirements associated with the capacity addition. Previously expected to fly the CS100 by the end of last year, Bombardier consequently moved the target to the end of June, therefore delaying certification until mid-2014.

Latvia's Air Baltic has become the first customer for the \"extra capacity\" jet, although it has opted to configure its aircraft with 148 seats. It was not immediately clear if the 148-seat layout would be utilised on all 10 CS300s ordered by Air Baltic. The CS300 is designed to seat 135 passengers in a standard two-class configuration and can seat up to 145 passengers with the standard exit-door layout. The 160-seat version has been under evaluation by several major low-cost airlines including Vueling and EasyJet and was previously rejected by AirAsia.

The company announced the increased capacity during a briefing at its facility in Mirabel, north of Montreal. The first flight of the long-awaited CSeries jets - Bombardier's new family of planes for commercial airlines - is expected by the end of June. The CSeries 100 jet will have 100 to 125 seats and the CSeries 300 jet will have 135 to 160 seats. The CSeries planes are larger than Bombardier's older CRJ regional jets and Q400 turboprop planes, which have fewer than 100 seats. They are also partially made from advanced composite materials that promise to deliver a 15 per cent reduction in cash operating costs and a 20 per cent fuel burn reduction. \"The CSeries aircraft is a game-changer in a changing economic environment, and following keen customer interest and market trends, we have enhanced the productivity of the CS300 aircraft further by offering the extra capacity seating option,\" said Mike Arcamone, president of Bombardier Commercial Aircraft. A Russian leasing company announced last month it has agreed to purchase up to 42 Bombardier CSeries aircraft in a potential $3.42-billion deal. Ilyushin Finance Co. is seeking to acquire 32 of the CS300 planes at a list price of about US$2.56 billion, and has options for 10 additional planes, making it one of the largest CSeries orders to date.

The Montreal-based company said the CS100 is now expected to enter into service in the second half of 2015, to be followed about six months later by the larger CS300 aircraft. Shortly before that announcement, Bombardier received a firm order for 16 new- generation CS300 jets for SaudiGulf Airlines, a deal worth about US$1.21 billion at list prices before options. A delay of the CSeries delivery was widely anticipated due to the small number of test flights since Sept. 16, when the CS100 flew for the first time after years of preparatory work. The company initially targeted 12-months of test flights, with the first CSeries plane going into service within a short but undefined period after that. The plan announced Thursday provides Bombardier a six-month window for getting the first CSeries into service, between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2015 - up to 15 months later than expected. 'Making solid progress': Bombardier said the CSeries flight test program is \"making solid progress\" and initial performance results are \"in line\" with its expectations. But it said the flight test phase requires more time to ensure it has what it calls \"overall system maturity.\" \"We are taking the required time to ensure a flawless entry-into-service. We are very pleased that no major design changes have been identified, this gives us confidence that we will meet our performance targets,\" stated Mike Arcamone, president Bombardier Commercial Aircraft. Arcamone said the CSeries test program should gain traction in the coming months following the first flight of the second 110- to 125-seat CS100 test aircraft, on Jan. 3. The first test aircraft is being shipped to Bombardier's flight test headquarters in Wichita, Kan., to escape Quebec's cold winter in order to record more test hours. A third test aircraft should be ready for flight in the coming weeks. Cameron Doerksen of National Bank Financial said he doesn't expect the delay will lead to any order cancellations, but it's unclear if Bombardier will incur any penalties. \"It is no surprise that the EIS date has been pushed to the right,\" he wrote in a report. \"However, the new date is even later than our expectation and certainly beyond the consensus view...for the first quarter 2015.\" Doerksen said the delay could add several hundred millions of dollars to the US$3.9 billion program, mainly related to engineering, flight testing and interest expenses. But he doesn't foresee a liquidity problem for Bombardier because of the expected strong cash generation in the fourth quarter. He said the \"clearly negative news\" is tempered somewhat by an order from SaudiGulf, announced Thursday before the delay was revealed. 800 planes the breakeven point: \"We believe further negative news could be announced by Bombardier in the near-term reduced margin guidance, possible miss on 2013 aircraft deliveries.\" Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets said increased costs from the delay means that Bombardier will need to sell more than 800 aircraft to break even, or 12 per cent market share over the next 20 years. He suspects the delay is prompted by issues with the aircraft's avionics and fly-by-wire system since it continues to fly under \"direct\" mode. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Bombardier's shares fell 35 cents, or nearly 7.7 per cent to $4.17 Cdn at the close of trading Thursday. Meanwhile, Bombardier spokesman Marc Duchesne said the delivery delay approved by Bombardier's board of directors Wednesday is the final one. \"This is serious. Trust me, people are not happy about this and we're not proud of this,\" he said in an interview. Other delays: The company gave similar assurances before again delaying the aircraft's first flight. The aerospace industry has a poor track record of delivering new aircraft on schedule. Boeing and Airbus both experienced lengthy delays in introducing their new wide-body aircraft. Bombardier hopes the fuel-efficient aircraft that's been in development for a decade will be a game-changer for the company, whose regional jets face an uncertain future amid increased competition, and which is the world's leading producer of business jets. The program is expected to generate US$5 billion to US$8 billion in annual revenues as it seeks to capture about half of the global sales for this size of plane. The newly designed aircraft, built partially with lightweight composite materials and powered by Pratt & Whitney's fuel-saving engines, is targeted at established carriers looking to replace older, inefficient planes, and new airlines launching in developing countries, such as China, to service the growing middle class and airport expansion. Duchesne said CSeries suppliers are on board with the delay and customers have been notified over the past couple of days. \"Of course they're not happy about it but they're definitely supportive.\" He said Malmo Aviation of Sweden will become the first CS100 operator. The company has firm orders for five CS100 and five CS300, plus 10 options. In the earlier announcement, Bombardier said SaudiGulf's contract would increase to US$1.99 billion if the buyer exercises options to acquire another 10 CSeries of the 120- to 160-seat CS300 aircraft. The agreement with Al Qahtani Aviation company, signed at the Bahrain air show, means that Bombardier has firm orders for 198 CSeries planes plus nearly 250 options or commitments from a total of 17 customers. The manufacturer has stated it hopes to secure 300 firm orders from more than 20 customers by the aircraft's entry-into-service. SaudiGulf Airlines will operate domestic and international flights, with the international route network focusing on main capitals in the Middle East and Gulf as well as the Indian subcontinent. It becomes the third Middle Eastern carrier to order the CSeries.

However, based on the thorough review of the CSeries program after the first flight of the CS100 on Sept. 16, 2013, the flight test phase will require more time than originally anticipated to ensure, amongst other things, that the aircraft has the overall system maturity to support a successful entry-into-service. TheCS100 aircraft's entry-into-service is now scheduled for the second half of 2015 and will be followed by the CS300 aircraft's entry-into-service approximately 6 months afterwards. \"We are taking the required time to ensure a flawless entry-into-service.

The Montreal-based aircraft maker said an affiliate of the Ireland-based leasing company placed a firm order for 40 of the larger CS300 jetliners, with options for 10 more. The firm order is worth US$3.14 billion at list prices and US$3.95 billion with options, although customers typically receive discounts for large orders. Macquarie AirFinance, which currently owns or manages 136 jet aircraft leased to 73 operators in 43 countries, will lease the planes after they are delivered between 2017 and 2019. \"Macquarie AirFinance's selection of the CS300 aircraft is a strong endorsement of the aircraft type and we are looking forward to working with this unique lessor to expand the market for our 100 per cent new jetliner,\" said Mike Arcamone, president, Bombardier commercial aircraft. The firm order is the first since program testing resumed Sept. 7 after a more than three-month pause following an engine failure during ground maintenance testing. The firm order matches the 40 aircraft ordered by Republic Airways, which also has options on 40 others. Deutsche Lufthansa is the largest customer of the smaller CS100, with 30 firm orders and 40 options. Arcamone said Bombardier anticipates \"continued momentum\" for the CSeries as testing confirms the promised fuel, noise, cost and other operating performance. Macquarie is a new Bombardier customer and the largest leasing company to sign on to the CSeries. The CSeries is in the midst of flight testing that's required before the CSeries jets can go into commercial use. The Montreal-based aerospace and rail equipment company has said it's confident the CS100 aircraft will enter into service in the second half of 2015, with the larger CS300 following about six months later.

A stretch version of the original CS100, the CS300 is intended to seat 130-160 passengers. That would make it the largest airliner that the Canadian company offers. \"We are reaching an inflection point where finally we are getting momentum and soon we'll be able to go to market,\" Bombardier CEO Alain Bellemare said after the flight at the company's factory outside Montreal. The program marks Bombardier's first foray beyond its roots as a maker of small to midsize jets and turboprops design for \"regional\" routes. Traditionally Bombardier has mostly competed against Embraer, a Brazilian- based aircraft maker that also has traditionally focused on the regional market. However, the move to bigger aircraft draws Bombardier into competition against a formidable set of competitors. The size of the larger CS300 makes it a direct competitor to some versions of Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A319 narrow-body jets. That could be a dicey proposition for Bombardier given the long-established dominance in that market by Airbus and Boeing. Bombardier's original CSeries aircraft -- the CS100 -- made its first flight in September 2013, already two years behind schedule. Its troubles continued not long after when unspecified problems -- and then an uncontained engine failure in May -- left the test fleet spending more time on the ground than in the air.

Assuming that schedule holds, the CS300 is expected to follow six months later. Still, Bombardier believes its CSeries testing has finally rounded the bend, saying it has pushed through the most difficult phase. Indeed, since coming back online in early September, flight hours for CSeries aircraft have increased at a steady pace. Even if the program is back on track, Bombardier still faces a sales challenge for its CSeries planes. Orders have reduced to a trickle the last two years.

The flight test begins a nine-to-15-month certification programme for the largest variant of the CSeries. The 110-seat CS100 is currently scheduled to achieve entry into service in the second half of 2015, having began flight testing nearly 18 months ago. Although the CS100 is now running two years behind schedule, Bombardier has never altered its plan to deliver the first operational CS300 six months after completing the same milestone for the smaller variant. Accounting for about three-fourths of all 243 firm orders booked so far, the commercial success of the CS300 may hold the keys to the future of the programme. It enters flight testing with the benefit of 18 months of painful lessons learned on the CS100 programme. The smaller variant has dealt with multiple setbacks stemming from software delays and an engine malfunction that grounded the fleet for five months. An oil system component inside the Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1500G turbofan failed during a 29 May ground test, causing pieces of the low-pressure turbine to disintegrate and damage the wing and fuselage of the first test vehicle FTV-1. Flights resumed four months later with a minor redesign of the oil system. Several more weeks passed before Bombardier resolved the second major issue for the CS100. Until early October last year, the four aircraft in the flight test fleet had not activated the envelope protections enabled by the fly-by-wire system, due to the late delivery of the flight critical software. The CS300 stands to benefit from a functioning fly-by-wire system with envelope protections and a redesigned engine. Other than the slightly longer fuselage, the CS300 shares the same Rockwell Collins avionics augmented by Parker Aerospace fly-by-wire controls, P&W; engines and aluminium-lithium panel fuselage structure of the CS100.

Three sources told us the CSeries flight tests were turning in better-than-guarantee results. Rob Dewer, vice president and general manager, CSeries Program, confirmed the information today in an exclusive interview. \"We weren't planning to make that public until Le Bourget but your sources are good,\" Dewar said. The results are \"favorable to our brochure. For us that is really, really positive. We won't share precise numbers\" until the Paris Air Show in June. \"We're taking advantage of that as soon as performance data becomes available, we share with current customers,\" Dewar says. \"We're sharing it with potential customers. This is all within the last couple of weeks.\" Dewar also says that the payload/range and fuel burn is more favorable than expected. This will enable the operators to either carry more passengers at the same advertised 2,950nm range or carry a typical passenger load farther. He wouldn't reveal the new range figure, holding this for the Air Show, but he said the increased range is \"significant, it's not a small number.\" Noise tests are done and also came in better than guarantees. Noise factors are critical for Toronto City Airport and London City Airport, where runway performance is also crucial. Noise tests are 1db better than the brochure. There was a margin of 5db between the brochure and the contract guarantees, Dewar said. Final noise certification will be this spring and runway Vmu and brake tests remain to be complete, the latter in about six weeks. Eighty percent of the high risk tests have been done, Dewar said. The program has completed 1,180 flight hours with 160 hours per month going on. Flight Test Vehicle 5 (which is fully equipped with the interior) will fly before April 1, Dewar says. Canadian authorities require 2,400 flight test hours. At the current rate of 160 hours per month, BBD needs just under eight months, or through October, to complete the 2,400 hours. The addition of FTV 5 should shorten this period. Going into the first flight of the CS300 last week, BBD didn't have a first operator.

The state-of-the-art Canadian airliner opened its career with a short flight from Zurich to Paris. The Swiss Global Bombardier is the first of 30 C-Series jets the airline has on order, split evenly between the smaller CS100 and the larger CS300. \"I am extremely proud that we are the first airline in the world to put this totally newly developed aircraft into service,\" Swiss Global's Chief Commercial Officer Markus Binkert said in a statement. \"The Bombardier CS100 is a class act in every respect: comfort, economics, and environmental credentials.\" According to Airways Mag Managing Editor Chris Sloan, the CS100's first flight with Swiss went flawlessly, apart from a slight delay caused by a glitch while switching from ground power to onboard electricity. Passengers were served a snack of trout mousse and black forest roulade, reported Sloan, who was on the 54-minute flight. Swiss Global's Bombardier CS100 is outfitted with 101 seats and will be replacing the airline's aging Avro RJ100 regional jets. The Bombardier C-Series is positioned to compete against the two best-selling airliners of all time - the Airbus A320 family and the Boeing 737 family. Capable of ferrying between 100 and 150 passengers, the Canadian jet is the most viable threat Airbus and Boeing have encountered in 20 years. Over the the next few years, several manufacturers from around the world will launch aircraft aimed to compete with Airbus and Boeing. But Bombardier is the first to enter service and the only one that will compete head-to-head within one of their most important market segments. Not since the demise of McDonnell Douglas and its MD-80 and MD-90 in the late '90s has there been a third major player to challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. With the C-Series, Bombardier is poised to do just that. However, the Quebec- based firm has a long way to go. Currently, Bombardier has more than 300 firm orders for the plane, while Airbus and Boeing each have backlogs with 10 times that amount for their latest A320 and 737 variants. What Bombardier has going for it is the fact that the C-Series is widely viewed as a great plane - receiving critical acclaim for its fuel efficiency, range, and advanced technology. \"The CS300 kills the Boeing 737 MAX 7 and the Airbus A319neo in terms of ability and efficiency,\" Airways senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider in an interview last year. Unfortunately, Bombardier has also been plagued by development and financial setbacks caused by the multibillion-dollar C-Series program. At the same time, the company struggled to find buyers for the state-of-the-art jet - especially among the world's A-list airlines. With the CS100 in service, a major commitment from Air Canada, and a $5.6 billion order from Delta, things are looking up for Bombardier. Air Canada and Delta's show of support for the aircraft and its manufacturer should allay the fears of smaller customers who are hesitant to buy because of Bombardier's precarious financial condition. In addition, the CS300 is expected to be delivered to AirBaltic by the end of the year.

The company's \"footprint in China continues to grow with approximately 150 aircraft in service at present,\" Bombardier Commercial Aircraft vice president of sales, marketing and asset management Colin Bole told a press gathering at the Zhuhai Aerodrome. \"Overall the demand for passenger/cargo aircraft in China is projected to be second only to North America in the coming years. This includes a 2,450-aircraft projection in the 60- to 150-seat range-the segment of the market that we at Bombardier cover-in the next 20 years.\" Bole reported \"a substantial backlog\" for the C Series, including an order and options for 75 CS300s from Air Canada and an order for 125 CS100s-convertible to CS300s-from Delta Air Lines. \"We have secured some 300 orders for this model, which is optimal for launching a new design of this type,\" he said. Bombardier believes China will account for more than 15 percent of the total world demand for 100- to 150-seat aircraft over the coming 20-year period. \"The Chinese government wants to make air travel available to all its citizens, with a major emphasis on the regional market,\" noted Bole. \"Many people are living in Midwest regions of China, which requires regional flights for them to gain access to major air travel hubs. This government support-along with the rapid plans for overall economic and infrastructure modernization-will prompt significant growth in these kinds of regional markets.\" Bombardier claims the CS100 and CS300 both can operate more effectively than other models when flying from challenging airports and climatic conditions in locations like Lhasa, Tibet. \"The aircraft will also carry more cargo than any other model in its size or class,\" said Bole, who referenced Bombardier's flexible cabin configuration, which allows for 40 percent more carry-on luggage than its previous models. He and other Bombardier officials pointed out that CS100 and CS300 address a market that the company's competitors do not. Meanwhile, Bombardier's models do not compete head-to-head with current indigenous Chinese programs like the Comac C919, due to their smaller size. \" The C919 could be a fine aircraft, but the CS100 and CS300 will act as complementary aircraft\" for any potential C919 applications, said Bole.

One of the company's other customers, Chongching-based China Express airlines, concentrates on service to China's small to medium-sized cities. Analysts of China's market told AIN that if Chinese home-grown aircraft programs fail to produce useful or practical solutions on time, then firms like Bombardier will reap the benefit with an ability to offer an off-the- shelf product that satisfies a need in the region.

A wide-scale two-phase competition was held over a number of months. Firstly, SWISS asked the Swiss Romands: \"What does Swiss Romandy mean to you?\" The response quote was phenomenal: more than 7,000 people answered with a slogan, a phrase or just a word.

The European routes operated by Deutsche Lufthansa AG's Swiss arm should demonstrate the plane's abilities to potential buyers and open up the possibility of service to the U.S. that would establish its long-haul credentials, C Series program head Rob Dewar said in a telephone interview. The narrow-body jet offers double the range, 25 per cent more capacity and a quieter noise footprint than other planes at London City, where flights are limited by a short runway and stringent environmental curbs, Dewar said. The aircraft has performed a test flight from the airport to New York's John F. Kennedy International hub in a 44-seat, all-business-class layout. \"From City you could do many destinations in eastern North America,\" Dewar said. \"There are many customers now - more than a handful - looking at the capability of the C Series for long-range routes, some of them trans- Atlantic.\" British Airways already has a narrow-body operation from London City to New York, though its single-class Airbus SE A318 planes are limited to 32 flat-bed seats and must refuel in Ireland to make the trip because of weight restrictions when departing the U.K. airport. From standard-runway airports, the C Series could perform trans-Atlantic trips in a multiclass configuration with a full load and would be best-suited to linking secondary terminals, swapping one flight for as many as many as three via the major hubs, Dewar said. He added that there's also some interest in low-cost, single-class operations, with carriers asking Bombardier to study potential routes. \"It's something the aircraft can do, though it's not the focus of our core market,\" he said. The start of flights this week at London City, which Dewar called the \"most challenging\" of urban airports, should also encourage carriers to explore the case for using the C Series at other constrained terminals. Those range from Colorado ski resort Aspen, which could be served direct from New York with a full load, to Lhasa in the Chinese autonomous region of Tibet, where so-called hot-and-high conditions limit aircraft types. The appeal of the C Series - which comes in two sizes in a range of 100 to 150 seats -- may be enhanced by further flights from London City to be offered by U.K. startup Odyssey Airlines and Geneva-based charter specialist PrivatAir, which have ordered 10 and five aircraft respectively. The biggest model can be outfitted with as many as 160 seats in a so-called high-density configuration. Dewar reiterated that Bombardier expects to announce more C Series deals this year and that talks continue with existing customers and potential new clients. The manufacturer is in discussions with Qatar Airways after the Gulf carrier said in June that the aircraft might be suited to a 100-plane Indian operation it has won permission to establish. The 30 or so C Series deliveries planned for this year will be loaded to the \"back end\" following issues with the supply of engines from United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney unit. The problem is not as acute as that concerning the engine variant that Pratt supplies for Airbus's A320neo family, Dewar said.", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bombardier-pitches-c-series-for-trans-atlantic-flights/article35930398/"}, {"title": "Bombardier announces agreement with EgyptAir for up to 24 CS300 aircraft", "date": "2017-11-14", "content": "Bombardier Inc. said its deal with Airbus has yet to ignite new sales discussions, but existing efforts have yielded results as the manufacturer announced back-to-back potential orders including one with Africa's largest airline.

Bombardier has signed its second potential C Series order in less than two weeks after EgyptAir Holding Co. announced plans to purchase up to 24 aircraft. The agreement announced at the Dubai Airshow includes 12 CS300 aircraft with purchase rights for an additional 12 aircraft. Bellemare acknowledged that the orders had nothing to do with Airbus even though the partnership gave customers added comfort that the European giant will put its full weight behind the C Series. \"This is very good but it's the work our team was doing with airline customers,\" he told analysts. \"It keeps on building the momentum up.\" Bombardier said that based on the list price of the CS300, a firm order for 12 aircraft would be valued at about $1.4 billion. That would double if the airline exercises the 12 purchase rights. However, airlines typically receive large discounts. \"It would be difficult to wish for a better carrier to establish our presence in the region,\" Colin Bole, Bombardier senior vice president commercial aerospace, said in a conference call with reporters from Dubai. \"It's a great template and it is something that will be followed extremely closely by the other carriers in the regions and the sub regions in the area.\" The C Series has also been ordered by Iraqi Airways, Saudi Gulf and Gulf Air. The national airline of Egypt told reporters in Dubai that while it has been studying the C Series for a long time, Airbus' involvement makes them feel better about the program, Bombardier commercial aircraft president Fred Cromer added on the conference call. EgyptAir chairman and CEO Safwat Musallam said the planes will help the airline to modernize its fleet and better serve destinations in the Middle East and Europe. Analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group says Airbus' involvement will assuage fears that the C Series will be an \"orphan\" airplane because it will have the support of the European aerospace giant. \"I would argue that the Airbus effect will be fairly profound,\" he said in an interview. Aboulafia said the C Series is a great plane but Bombardier has had major financial issues. \"That is no longer a problem. You remove that, you now have just a great jet that the people want.\" The EgyptAir letter of intent and a deal for 31 planes plus options for 30 announced Nov. 2 with an undisclosed customer are expected to be firmed up by the end of the year. That would raise the number of firm C Series orders to more than 400. Bombardier said it remains confident that Boeing won't be able to prove in its trade complaint that it has been damaged by the C Series since it doesn't make a plane the size of the CS100 and wasn't invited to bid on the Delta order. Nonetheless, Cromer said Bombardier is developing contingency plans if high tariffs continue to be applied on aircraft manufactured in Canada and delivered to the U.S. \"We have opportunities to place some of those early Delta positions with other airlines,\" he said. Cromer declined to say if the second assembly line in Alabama estimated by the company to be built at a cost of more than $300 million would be affected by the maintenance of high U.S. duties. Bellemare added that Bombardier was never seeking to use the C Series to compete with Boeing or Airbus. Rather, its competitor for the 100- to 150-seat aircraft will remain Brazil's Embraer. \"There were two yesterday and there will be two tomorrow,\" he said.

No, the jet isn't being scrapped, but it is taking on a new name as Airbus cements its new majority stake in the product line. Airbus is extending its naming convention to the jets, rebranding the CSeries as the Airbus A220. The smaller CS100, which can seat about 120 passengers in a typical configuration, will now be called the A220-100. The larger CS300 that can seat 130 to 140 passengers in a standard layout will be known as the A220-300. Airbus' new \"A220\" designation places its new line of smaller jets from Bombardier below Airbus' existing \"A300\" lineup of jets. That lineup currently ranges from the A320 family of single-aisle planes that start at about 125 seats up to Airbus' double-decked A380 superjumbo jet that can seat more than 600 passengers in \"high-density\" configurations. In a statement announcing the name aircraft names, Airbus said that A220 aircraft \"are fully optimized for the 100 to 150 seat market and perfectly complement Airbus' existing ...

The A220 now enters a new phase in its career with all Airbus' resources behind it to further its commercial success worldwide.\" Airbus and Bombardier first announced their tie-up last October as Canadian jetmaker Bombardier looked for a resolution to a trade dispute in which the United States threatened tariffs of up to 300% on the CSeries jets. The threatened tariffs followed a formal complaint launched by Boeing that alleged unfair subsidies for the Canadian-made jet, which was buoyed by a large order from Atlanta-based Delta. The United States ultimately confirmed unfair subsidies, but backed off the tariffs because it said Boeing could not prove harm from them. However, that didn't come before Bombardier sought refuge in a deal with Boeing's archrival Airbus that would allow U.S.-bound CSeries jets to be assembled at Airbus' recently opened assembly line in Alabama. The deal ended up giving Airbus a majority stake in the CSeries line. Since then, Boeing has followed up plans to cement its own partnership with Bombardier's Brazilian-based rival Embraer, further extending the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus. Bombardier and Embraer have traditionally focused mostly on regional jets, but each has introduced new lines of planes that can seat roughly 100 to 150 passengers, depending on the model and configuration. That new lineup of planes has brought the regional jetmaker's planes right up to the cusp of the smallest models offered by Boeing and Airbus. Now, the recent deals have brought Boeing and Airbus - the world's two largest jetmakers - squarely into the picture.

AirBaltic, which has committed to operating single type C-Series fleet as part of its Destination 2025 strategy, demonstrated its commitment to the aircraft by placing orders for up to 60 new jets this May and expressed its support today for the rebranding. \"We're glad to join the Airbus Family with Bombardier CS300 officially becoming Airbus A220-300. We are looking forward to introducing an all-Airbus fleet,\" the airline Tweeted. Delta's 2016 order of 75 planes was also a significant vote of confidence in the long-term viability of this aircraft. The C-Series-now A220-offers passengers comfort features that match new generation planes including more room, large windows and programmable mood lighting, and digital passenger service units that can display information including a digital flight map. Airbus plans to integrate features of its Airspace cabin design into the C-Series to achieve greater \"seamlessness\" of experience across Airbus models. But any modifications are more likely motivated by supply chain efficiencies, to Airbus' advantage. Philippe Balducchi, president of CSALP-the new Airbus partnership with Canada's Bombardier-said a ramp-up of production in anticipation of new orders is already underway. Boeing-Embraer: Boeing announced a joint venture with Embraer that would add the Brazilian manufacturer's E2 regional jets to the Boeing product offering. This puts Boeing in a position to directly compete with the A220. Airbus knocked the growing variety of the Boeing product line during its presentations for the reveal of the A220, suggesting that its line up of five narrowbody aircraft types is more likely to succeed than Boeing's combined lineup of seven aircraft types-with the Embraer E195E2 and E190E2 regional jets included. Boeing's second-quarter deliveries, released today, suggest that the U.S. airframe manufacturer has little to worry about. The manufacturer delivered 137 of its 737 line this quarter, 269 so far this year. It has increased aircraft deliveries by 7% during the first half of 2018 over last year. Boeing also netted 460 new aircraft orders during this period, compared to Airbus' 206 net orders, as Reuters reports. The Puget Sound Business Journal has reported that Boeing and Embraer may collaborate on a future 737 replacement. The Journal cites a report by analyst Saj Ahmad of StrategicAero Reseach in which Ahmad describes the Boeing-Embraer partnership as more advantageous and offers a harsh take of the long-term success of the Airbus- Bombardier collaboration, referring to its \"abject market irrelevance.\" The Boeing-Embraer deal is more versatile and supports the advancement of new aircraft in both the military and commercial sector, Ahmad says, including possibly Boeing's NMA 797 aircraft. The view that Embraer may help advance the 797 is shared by Scott Hamilton of Leeham News. Flight Global reported that Boeing registered '797' European Union Intellectual Property Office in August of last year, perhaps as a warning shot to Airbus that Boeing means business. With the Farnborough Airshow coming up next week, all eyes will be on whether Boeing makes a formal announcement on the 797 and what orders go where on regional jets. Reuters reported that higher oil prices are expected to stimulate the market, leading to as many as 900 new aircraft orders during the Airshow.

Coming fresh from the paint shop, the A220-300 landed at the company's Henri-Ziegler Delivery Centre near Toulouse, France at 12:25 pm CEST as an audience of media and Airbus employees looked on. The debut marks the formal transfer of the former Bombardier C-Series airliners to the Airbus inventory that will see the CS100 and the CS300 marketed as the Airbus A220-100 and A220-300. The Airbus 220 series was acquired by the Airbus Group when it went into partnership with Bombardier Aerospace in October 2017. Airbus took a 51 percent share in the project and intends to expand production to 6,000 units over 20 years with assembly in Quebec, Canada and Mobile, Alabama. Now that regulatory approval has been secured, the airliners can be marketed under the Airbus name. The A220-300 with the A220 team Airbus According to Airbus, the A220-100 is the smallest airliner in the company's current production line-up, seating 100 to 135 passengers. Meanwhile, the A220-300 seats 130 to 160. Both single-aisle aircraft use advanced aluminum structures and carbon composites, share commonality in over 99 percent of the line-replaceable units, and use the same Pratt & Whitney PW1500G fanjet engines. While the A220-300 has greater range, the A220-100 is capable of taking off from city airports with shorter runways. \"Everyone at Airbus has been looking forward to this historic moment,\" says Guillaume Faury, Airbus President Commercial Aircraft. \"Today, we are thrilled to welcome the A220 to the Airbus family and are honored to see it wearing its new Airbus colors for the first time. I pay tribute to all the women and men at Bombardier and the supply chain who have strived over the past years to bring this fantastic aircraft to the world. The A220 now enters a new phase in its career with all Airbus' resources behind it to further its commercial success worldwide.\" Source: Airbus ", "url": "https://newatlas.com/airbus-a220-debut/55422/"}, {"title": "Looking up", "date": "2018-08-13", "content": "As it launched into the blue, cloud-streaked sky over Farnborough International Airport in mid-July, the aircraft formerly known as Bombardier's C Series CS300 seemed to blend in as much as it stood out. It was just days removed from a major rebrand, after Airbus' controlling stake in the C Series took effect on July 1, and the aircraft arrived at Farnborough in a simple, white-and-blue livery and with a new name painted on its side: Airbus A220-300. Appearances aside, the A220-300's arrival at the Farnborough International Airshow, which ran July 16 to 22, may have been a turning point in the program. After a chaotic year, punctuated with the threat of massive tariffs from the United States that threatened the future of the C Series and prompted the deal with Airbus, the program is showing signs of life. Airbus announced a memorandum of understanding at Farnborough to provide 60 A220-300 aircraft to a new start-up airline backed by JetBlue founder David Neeleman. That deal followed on the heels of a similar agreement with JetBlue itself for 60 A220-300s, announced just prior to Farnborough, which bills itself as the world's largest airshow. \"After years of U.S. airline consolidation, the conditions are improving for a new generation of U.S. airline to emerge, focused on passenger service and satisfaction,\" said Neeleman in a news release. \"The A220 will enable us to serve thinner routes in comfort without compromising cost, especially on longer-range missions.\" After a chaotic year, Airbus's A220 aircraft program-formerly the Bombardier C Series family-is showing signs of life, following a couple of significant orders for the A220-300 announced around the Farnborough Airshow. Rich Cooper Photo Deliveries to the start-up airline are set to begin in 2021, and JetBlue expects its first deliveries in 2020. \"This U.S. airline startup's decision for the A220 as the platform on which to launch their new business model is a testament to the passenger appeal and operating economics of this outstanding aircraft,\" said Eric Schulz, chief commercial officer for Airbus. This was not the tsunami of new orders Airbus may have hoped for, but it was certainly a wave worth catching, and perhaps a sign of things to come. LOOKING UP: While the A220 orders were a major story for Canadian aerospace-Bombardier still has a 34 per cent stake in the program, and Investissement Quebec owns about 16 per cent-they were symptoms of general optimism at Farnborough. It was a remarkably successful show for many of the major OEMs, with more than 1,400 orders and commitments announced. Boeing says it won a total of 673 aircraft orders valued at nearly US$100 billion. Airbus confirmed agreements for 431 new commercial aircraft, although it did not disclose a corresponding value for those orders. Embraer announced orders and commitments for 300 aircraft, valued at US$15.3 billion, while Bombardier added just one firm order for four CRJ900 aircraft to Uganda National Airlines. \"Boeing led the way at Farnborough,\" said Dennis Muilenburg, the company's chairman, president and CEO. \"We will continue to win in the marketplace thanks to our talented team.\" NEW FOCUS: Bombardier used Farnborough to refocus on its business jet and regional airline offerings, making several announcements that may boost sales down the line. The company revealed its Challenger 350 business jet has achieved Transport Canada steep approach certification, allowing operators to land at the steep 5.5 degree approach angle, and on the short runway at London City Airport. Both European Aviation Safety Agency and Federal Aviation Administration steep approach certifications are expected this year. Bombardier also unveiled its new Atmosphere cabin design for CRJ Series aircraft, in partnership with launch operator Delta Air Lines and supplier Zodiac Aerospace. The company bills Atmosphere as a philosophy as well as a design, aimed at delivering a higher level of passenger comfort, convenience and accessibility while ensuring maximum branding opportunities for airlines. Its features include spacious overhead bins, the largest windows in its class, Internet connectivity, and an accessible lavatory for passengers with reduced mobility. The CRJ Series is the first and only regional aircraft to offer a PRM lavatory option, according to Bombardier. At Farnborough, the company also showcased its Q400 turboprop, in Ethiopian Airlines livery, and the Global 6000 business jet. Bombardier announced during the show that TAG Aviation Europe, a leading private and business aviation service provider, is the first to offer the long range Global 5000 aircraft with Premier cabin, for charter to European customers. GOVERNMENT PRESENCE: Canada's federal government had a considerable presence at Farnborough, sending cabinet ministers Navdeep Bains, Marc Garneau and Carla Qualtrough to spread the word about Canada's world-class aerospace industry. Bains, who is minister of innovation, science and economic development, led the government's charm offensive and highlighted the country's globally-integrated, export-oriented and innovation-driven approach. The three ministers accompanied a delegation of 420 representatives from more than 130 Canadian aerospace companies to the airshow. Bains and his colleagues held meetings with leaders of aerospace companies based in Canada and around the world, according to a news release. \"I am proud to have had the opportunity to share with the world why Canada is a destination of choice for companies and investors in the aerospace industry,\" said Bains. \"Canada is a world leader in aerospace innovation, and we want to keep that enviable position.\" CAE: Montreal-based CAE used Farnborough to launch the CAE 700MR Series flight training device, a next-generation platform designed specifically for military helicopter flight and mission training. The CAE 700MR Series FTD is based on the CAE 3000MR Series full-mission helicopter simulator, but in a fixed-base platform with a dynamic seat for vibration and motion cueing. Key features include an extreme field-of-view visual system with a CAE Medallion-6000XR image generator to provide an immersive training experience; computer-generated forces software for a realistic tactical synthetic environment; and support for military-specific training scenarios, including ship deck landings, night vision goggle training and confined area landing training. \"We listened to our customers to design and develop a high-end flight training device that addresses the highest priorities for military helicopter mission training,\" said Gene Colabatistto, CAE's group president, Defence and Security. CAE also introduced its new Women in Flight scholarship program at Farnborough with the goal of helping women advance in the aviation industry. Through the program, CAE intends to provide financial support to aspiring female pilots by awarding up to five full scholarships to one of the cadet pilot training programs in its global training network. CAE also plans to give selected candidates access to their first job through the company's global partners. Another objective is to elevate selected candidates to become aviation role models and inspire even more women to become pilots. BELL: Bell announced at Farnborough it will collaborate with Subaru Corporation on a commercial enhancement of the Bell 412 EPI helicopter-type certified in July as the Subaru Bell 412EPX-in support of the Japan UH-X program. Subaru was awarded the contract to replace Japan Ground Self Defence Force's current fleet of UH-1J aircraft with a militarized derivative of the Subaru Bell 412 EPX. The 412 EPX will benefit from a more robust main rotor gearbox dry run capability, increased internal maximum gross weight to 12,200 pounds and mast torque output of more than 11 per cent at speeds below 60 knots. A commercial prototype has undergone testing at Bell's facility in Mirabel, Que., and it received Federal Aviation Administration certification on July 5, 2018. Bell also announced the Bell 429 global fleet has exceeded 330,000 hours of operation. There are 325 Bell 429 aircraft operating in countries around the world, including Australia, Canada, France, Indonesia, Kuwait, Oman, Switzerland, Slovakia, Sweden, Turkey, Thailand, the United States and the United Kingdom. P&WC: Pratt & Whitney Canada announced at Farnborough it has signed an agreement with Hawker Pacific that will see the two companies work together to enhance the delivery of customer services and solutions. The agreement spans most P&WC engine models and diagnostics and prognostics products across all segments, including business aviation, general aviation, offshore, utility, regional aviation and defence and security. Under the agreement, Hawker Pacific will provide an array of maintenance, repair, engineering and customer support services to P&WC engine customers, as well as mobile repair technician services. The two companies will collaborate to deliver and install P&WC's diagnostic, prognostics and engine health management solutions, including its FAST prognostics solution, under its Digital Engine Services portfolio. P&WC also announced that China Southern Airlines has selected the APS3200 auxiliary power unit for the airline's order of 104 purchased and leased aircraft from the Airbus A320 family. The airline has signed a long-term, comprehensive support agreement with P&WC to cover APS3200 maintenance. With this contract award, China Southern will operate more than 250 Airbus A320 family aircraft with the APS3200. OTHER PLAYERS: MDA announced during the show it has acquired Neptec Design Group Ltd., a leading electro-optical and electro-mechanical systems and high-performance intelligent light detection and ranging company, for $42 million. The transaction is comprised of about $8 million in cash, with the balance in Maxar common shares, according to a news release. With Neptec, MDA intends to deliver end-to-end robotic systems and an expanded set of solutions, positioning the company to capture growth in U.S., Canadian and international global space exploration markets. Heroux-Devtek announced it has been awarded a five-year contract from Lockheed Martin to manufacture landing gear for C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. Under the agreement, Heroux-Devtek will manufacture and assemble landing gear for Lockheed Martin's global production of C-130J aircraft and provide spare parts over a five-year period beginning in January 2020. Boeing also selected Heroux-Devtek to manufacture main landing gear and side braces for F/A-18 Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler aircraft, with first deliveries in the third quarter of 2020. SkyX, a drone manufacturer based in Markham, Ont., launched its latest product at Farnborough 2018: the SkyTwo unmanned aircraft system. SkyTwo is an electric vertical takeoff and landing drone that flies beyond visual line of sight, with a planned range of 170 kilometres on a single charge. It would then recharge for about 2.5 hours on a remote xStation before continuing a mission. SkyTwo is in the research and development phase, with test flights expected to begin in September. SkyX expects the product to be market-ready in 2019. BRIGHT FUTURE: While Embraer made a bigger splash than Bombardier and the A220 family combined at Farnborough, all could benefit from a commercial airline market expected to swell in size over the next 20 years. Embraer is projecting demand for 10,550 new aircraft with up to 150 seats worldwide over the next two decades, depending on the economic health of the airline industry. If the forecast comes close to reality, the A220 family will likely battle head-to-head with Embraer's E-Jets E2 family, with Boeing as a likely partner for the Brazilian OEM. \"This commitment confirms the important role the A220 aircraft now occupies in our Airbus single-aisle portfolio,\" said Eric Schulz, chief operating officer for Airbus, as he announced the company's 60-aircraft deal with the U.S. startup. It was an understated way of saying this flashy, intentionally disruptive Canadian creation is now a relatively discreet member of the much larger Airbus family. It seems to blend in as much as it stands out, but it shows no signs of fading away.

The Moscow Vnukovo-based airline is expecting its first A220 in May, and Klyucharev hopes to showcase the aircraft with Red Wings's new livery at the Paris Airshow in June. Red Wings will take delivery of six of the Pratt & Whitney PW1500G-powered twinjets, fitted with 149 seats in an all-economy-class layout, as part of its fleet renewal, which will also see it add four secondhand A321s next year. It also has an order for 16 Irkut MC-21-300s. The carrier had expected deliveries of the new Russian single-aisle airliner to commence at the end of 2019, but delays in the program are likely to push the entry into service to 2020 or even 2021. \"It's not yet clear when exactly,\" Klyucharev said, revealing that Red Wings \"most probably will be launch customer due to our extensive experience with Russian-built aircraft.\" Red Wings CEO Evgeny Klyucharev with Airbus A220-300 models featuring the airline's new livery. Until 2017, Red Wings and its predecessor airline, VARZ-400/Airlines 400, operated only Russian-built aircraft such as the llyushin Il-76, Tupolev Tu-154 and Tu-204, and Sukhoi Superjet 100. That changed last year when it incorporated 12 A320 family aircraft to complement its Tu-204-100B fleet. It still had five Tu-204s in operation this summer, but they all will be phased out because they are not fuel efficient and procuring spare parts has become challenging, according to Klyucharev. The switch to Western-built aircraft resulted in steep growth. Red Wings expects to carry 2.7 million passengers this year, compared with less than 1 million in 2016, and revenue should total RUB18.5 billion, up from RUB6 billion in 2016. \"On top of all this growth, we reported a profit of around RUB200 million. We expect the same figure this year,\" Klyucharev noted. On the operations side, the carrier's Airbus narrowbody outperforms its Russian counterpart, with the A320 averaging 3,700 flight hours per year per aircraft compared to around 2,000 hours for the Tu-204s. Klyucharev said the company expects the A220 to be a \"very efficient plane.\" \"We talk a lot to airBaltic,\" he noted. The Latvian carrier served as launch operator of Bombardier's C Series CS300, which was rebranded as the A220-300 after Airbus took control of the program in July, and now has 13 in its fleet. In May, airBaltic topped up its existing order of 20 A220-300s with an additional 30 examples plus 30 options. Red Wings also intends to increase its A220 intake. \"We most probably will order a further four in 2021. This has been agreed in principle with our shareholder Ilyushin Finance,\" said Klyucharev. IFC was one of the C Series launch customers and in 2013 signed a purchase agreement to acquire 32 CS300s and options for an additional 10. The firm order was quietly downsized, initially to 20 in 2016 and later to 14 after it ceded six examples to Russia's State Transport Leasing Company. Airbus's orders and deliveries at the end of October showed 14 A220-300s for ILC and six for GTLK. The OEM's overview also showed that no firm orders for the A220 have been signed so far this year.

At the same time, JetBlue has placed firm orders for 60 A220-300 aircraft. This choice of aircraft will give the airlines flexibility to cover under- served regional markets and launch new low-cost short-haul shuttle services. Both orders were completed at the end of December, according to the aircraft manufacturer. Airbus will produce these 120 A220-300 planes at a new U.S. assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama. That new construction, which will break ground later this month, is adjacent to the existing Airbus A320 assembly facility. The plans for Moxy were revealed at the Farnborough Air Show last July. Neelam has defined the brand's positioning as high tech and the A220, as a high-tech aircraft, fits the bill. With this aircraft, Moxy could introduce profitable city pairs in underserved regional and short to mid-haul markets, in the U.S. and beyond. The A220-300 would also be suitable to introduce new frequent shuttle services between cities with high business passenger demand, where schedule flexibility might be attractive to passengers. The airline selected the Airbus A220-300 model because of its operational efficiencies and overall passenger comfort. This aircraft offers passengers a flying experience similar to flying on an A350XWB or a Boeing Dreamliner while traveling on a small plane for shorter distances. The A220 is designed expressly for the 100-150 seat market offering airlines optimum fuel efficiency and giving passengers an experience comparable to flying on modern widebody aircraft. The A220 operates with Pratt & Whitney's latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines, which claim 20% lower fuel burn than previous generation aircraft. It has a range of up to 3,200 nm, which allows Moxy to introduce a broad mix of city pairs in both regular and seasonal service. \"The A220-300 is the right airplane for a new airline that will be focused on passenger service and satisfaction,\" said Neeleman. \"With a low cost of operation and spacious cabin, the A220 will allow us to provide passengers with lower fares and a high quality, comfortable flying experience. The A220's ability to operate profitably in thin, underserved markets across a broad spectrum of ranges is unique\". Neeleman favors Airbus aircraft as reflected by the fleet mix at his other projects JetBlue, Azul Brazilian Airlines and TAP Air Portugal. But the choice of the new A220 reflects a strategy to right-size planes for routes where seat load factors would be lower than A320-family aircraft. Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer, said of the order: \"We believe the A220 really is the future of this segment of the market, and the flying public will know from the minute they set foot onboard that they're experiencing the best our industry has to offer.\" Delta Air Lines was the first U.S. carrier to commit to the A220 aircraft, back when the jet was still the Bombardier C-Series. JetBlue announced its plans to acquire A220 planes shortly after last year's Farnborough Air Show. \"As we approach our 20th anniversary, the impressive range and economics of the highly efficient A220, combined with the outstanding performance of our existing fleet of Airbus A321 and restyled A320 aircraft, will help ensure we deliver the best onboard experience to customers and meet our long-term financial targets as we continue disciplined growth into the future,\" said Robin Hayes, Chief Executive Officer, JetBlue, said on firming-up the order. These new orders bring the A220 order book to more than 500 aircraft to date. Airbus estimates that the 100- to 150-seat aircraft market will require at least 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.

Atlanta-based Delta is scheduled to begin flying its first 109-seat A220 on Jan. 31 with flights from New York's LaGuardia Airport to Boston Logan and Dallas/Fort Worth. However, it's yet to be seen if the partial shutdown of the federal government -- which affects personnel at the Federal Aviation Administration -- could delay the launch of the aircraft, which is still pending some regulatory approvals. \"Delta continues to monitor the situation and will work with the FAA to ensure that the A220 is fully certified when it enters our fleet,\" Delta said in a written statement. \"No customer disruption or impact to schedules are expected.\" The airline can use other jets in its fleet to operate the flights if needed. Delta, the second-largest airline in the world, says the new jets will be \"highly fuel-efficient,\" and Airbus says the A220 will set \"a new standard in short-haul flying,\" according to written statements. The airline announced Wednesday it is increasing its order of A220s to 90 from its original order of 75 in 2016. Delta is also upgrading to the larger A220-300 model for the new orders and converting a portion of its previous orders to the larger model, for a total order of 50 A220-300s. The other 40 orders will be for A220-100s. The larger A220-300s with 130 seats will be assembled at an Airbus facility in Mobile, Ala. Construction of the plant next to existing A320 production lines will start later this month. Delta said it expects to take delivery of its first A220-300 in 2020 and get all 90 A220s by the end of 2023. On Wednesday, Airbus also announced its first job openings for manufacturing positions for the new A220 production line in Mobile. The jobs include openings for aircraft structure/installation mechanics, installers for aircraft cabin furnishings and aircraft electricians. Airbus said it is also hiring for A320 production and expects to hire a total of about 600 new employees in the next year and a half. The A220 was initially developed by Bombardier and was previously known as the C Series CS100, before a tariff dispute broke out with Boeing. In the middle of the dispute, Airbus acquired a majority interest in the C Series business and announced plans to eventually open a final assembly facility for the plane in Mobile. The Trump administration had proposed tariffs of more than 200 percent, but the U.S. International Trade Commission ended up overturning the tariffs on Montreal-based Bombardier.

The original deal for 32 CS300s, with options for 10 more, was struck in 2013 by the then privately owned IFC. However, in the summer of 2016, the Moscow- based lessor restructured the agreement by reducing the firm order to 20 CS300s, plus one Q400 turboprop. An option for five Q400s has also since been added to the deal. The six CS300s, which were initially part of IFC's portfolio, were later ceded to GTLK. In the deal, Iyushin Finance formally keeps the remaining 14 aircraft of the type. The question remains: who will become the A220 start-up operator in Russia? In March of this year, Red Wings, Russia's only potential airline customer for the Airbus A220-300, abandoned its previous plans to lease six of them from GTLK, citing an unexpectedly amended contract price by the lessor.

The aircraft also leaves half the noise footprint and decreased emissions compared to its predecessor, making it a truly humanity-minded jetliner,\" it added. \"The two members of the A220 Family have more than 99 percent of the line- replaceable units in common. They are built with engines from the same family, meaning operators can fly both versions at significant savings costs. Flight crews and cabin members with the same pilot type rating will enjoy a seamless transition between the A220-300 and A220-100, increasing workflow and travel efficiency and decreasing training costs\" the website reads. Airbus has delivered more than 80 aircrafts of the type A220 to five regional and intercontinental airlines in Asia, the Americas, Africa and Europe, demonstrating the great potential of the new Airbus model.

Two months ago, airBaltic became the first airline entitled to provide a full scope of maintenance for Airbus A220-300 aircraft type, as confirmed by the company. SVP Technical Operations of airBaltic Andris Vaivads comments: After carrying more than 400 000 passengers, our first Airbus A220-300, registered as YL-CSA, has now successfully undergone a scheduled C check and received a number of other modifications which are necessary to further improve the reliability of the aircraft. During the winter season, we plan to perform C check on six more Airbus A220-300 aircraft. Obtaining the Line Maintenance and Base Maintenance certificate for Airbus A220-300 type has been a logical step for airBaltic as an airline which is the global launch operator of Airbus A220-330 with already 20 aircraft of this type in its fleet moving towards single type Airbus A220-300 fleet in the near future. Our maintenance is now more cost and time effective, Andris Vaivads adds. C check is a part of the aircraft maintenance program that has to be performed on all commercial aircraft after a certain time of usage. For Airbus A220-300, manufacturer has defined that a C check has to be performed every 8 500 flight hours.

Speaking with AIN just days ahead of the start of the show, Manougian highlighted the ability of the former Bombardier C Series jet to replace Embraer 190s on regional routes-in a fashion reflected by EgyptAir's replacement strategy-while covering long, thin narrowbody markets in the way Air Tanzania has done with its Dar es Salaam-Mumbai ETOPS flights and Air Baltic with its six-and-half-hour service between Riga and Abu Dhabi. By the middle of next year a 5,000-pound increase in maximum takeoff weight and a resulting 450 nm range extension will add still further capability to an aircraft uniquely positioned-in Airbus's estimation-to profitably fly 100 to 160 passengers between the Middle East and far into Western Europe and Asia. \"If we look at EgyptAir, that's able to do a regional operation,\" said Manougian, \"but at the same time it has the flexibility and the range the regional airplanes didn't have...and the flexibility to connect two far- flung destinations that don't necessarily have the market size to fill a large single-aisle airplane like the A320 or A321.\" While he said it remains too early to meaningfully gauge the dispatch reliability of the five A220-300s EgyptAir now flies, he reported that the airline has expressed satisfaction with their performance. \"EgyptAir is extremely happy in the early going, judging by the limited feedback that we've had,\" he noted, adding that early routes connect a few secondary markets in Saudi Arabia and key markets in Egypt such as Sharm El Sheikh. Now flying five of the 12 A220s it has ordered, EgyptAir expects to have taken all its airplanes by the middle of next year. Air Tanzania, meanwhile, recently doubled its initial order to four A220s after a year of what Manougian characterized as more than satisfactory operational performance. Neither airline, however, has experienced any of the engine problems that caused recent in-flight shutdowns at Swiss International Airlines, which resulted in a 24-hour grounding of that fleet. While the shutdowns-traced to a problem involving the low-pressure compressor-remains under investigation, Transport Canada airworthiness directives require boroscope inspections every 15 flight cycles and place a low-speed spool limitation of 94 percent of N1 at altitudes above 29,000 feet. Operators have conducted initial inspections on all of the A220s in service and have found no anomalies, according to Airbus. Apart from the low-pressure compressor issue, Pratt & Whitney expects to complete the remaining improvements to the A220's PW1500G turbofans, including installation of a full-life combustor, sometime next year. What will become the engine's fourth-generation combustor will last 25,000 hours, compared with the current generation's 13,000 hours. Meanwhile, Pratt has finished fitting all PW1500Gs with new liftoff seals, a redesign of which has resolved premature wear problems. While technical \"teething problems\" persist to a degree, the A220 hasn't suffered from a lack of accolades for its fuel-burn performance or interior space, which Manougian cited as a particularly important attribute for Middle East operations. \"If you travel around the region, you know that passengers carry a lot of bags and cargo,\" he said, noting that the A220's relatively large bins and cargo area give the Airbus a distinct advantage over regional jets in Middle East sales campaigns. Separately, Airbus's 2018 takeover of what then-Bombardier called the C Series has in itself given the program a boost in the region, said Manougian. \"There is an added buzz or interest with the partnership with Airbus,\" he noted. \"As Airbus is much more present in the region, with its wide array of products, we've seen a much bigger interest in the A220 than before.\" ", "url": "https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2019-11-16/airbus-a220-creating-buzz-middle-east"}, {"title": "A greener outlook for airBaltic as it takes its Airbus A220-300", "date": "2019-12-02", "content": "Latvian hybrid airline airBaltic has celebrated the acquisition of its 21st Airbus A220 jet - the 100th example of the type produced that was previously the Bombardier CS300 - at a special November 28 ceremony at the Airbus aircraft programme's Mirabel, Canada headquarters. It was three years ago that the world's first Airbus A220-300 took off from Montreal-Mirabel and landed in Riga on November 30, thus enabling airBaltic to become the world's first airline to launch the type's commercial operations on December 14, 2016.

The order is the biggest from a European carrier and another feather in the cap of the Airbus acquisition, which had an order book of 530 aircraft at the end of November. The A220 is pitted against Embraer's E-jets E2 family, soon to be majority-owned by Boeing. The newest member of the Embraer family, the E175-E2, recently took its inaugural flight and is heading into a rigorous 24-month flight test campaign. The deal allowing Boeing to take an 80 percent stake in Embraer's commercial jet division was delayed until early 2020 after the European Commission said it would undertake an investigation on anti-trust grounds. Once completed, it will see Boeing and Airbus competing directly in the market for aircraft of up to 150 seats. Airbus chief commercial officer Christian Scherer hailed the Air France confirmation \"as a great step towards fleet optimization for large network carriers\". Air France currently operates a fleet of 159 Airbus aircraft. \"The largest Airbus A220 order from a European carrier to date speaks volumes on Air France's ambitious sustainability drive,'' he said. \"The modern and fuel-efficient Airbus A220 will contribute to lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions significantly compared to older generation aircraft.\" The A220 offers a 20 percent lower fuel -burn per seat compared to older planes thanks to aerodynamic improvements, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney's latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines.

Air Canada's relationship with the type began nearly four years ago, when it signed a letter of intent to purchase 45 examples on Feb. 27, 2016. The LOI was finalized on June 28 that year and included options for an additional 30 units. The company's first copy first flew on Dec. 11, 2019 at Mirabel, Que., and was delivered to Dorval nine days later. Since then, it has flown numerous familiarization and training missions. On Jan. 16, Air Canada will operate its first A220 revenue flight, when AC317 departs Montreal for Calgary. For the next while, the aircraft will serve that city-pair on weekdays and shuttle between Montreal and Toronto during weekends. What's so exciting? Any new airliner that can attract customers and operate economically is bound to generate revenues and produce profits for its operator. That is why Air Canada's A220-300 is so attractive. A survey of its cabin reveals a comfortable environment. Up front, the business class cabin has 12 seats that feature a 37 inch/94 cm pitch. Further aft, the economy class cabin's 125 seats each have a 30 inch/76 cm pitch. At 19 inches, the Y-class seats are the widest in AC's fleet - albeit one inch wider than the rest. The spacious feel to the entire cabin is due to its wider aisle, windows that are 50 per cent larger than those of an A320, and 15 per cent bigger overhead bins. When you consider the new Panasonic in-flight entertainment system that features a 12-inch screen in the economy cabin and mood lighting, you sense that some passengers may not wish to deplane at their destination.

Larkin Photo Financial folks will be pleased with the A220-300's impressive operating cost metrics. Its new Pratt & Whitney PW1500G geared turbofan engines, also produced in Mirabel, enable the airplane to burn 20 per cent less fuel per mile flown compared to previous generation models. The jet also produces 20 per cent fewer CO2 emissions and has as much as a 50 per cent smaller noise footprint. It is an exemplary corporate citizen. A key attribute of the aircraft, is its impressive range. Thanks to its less thirsty engines, an A220-300 can fly 3,200 nautical miles. That is 33 per cent further than the 2,400 nm that a similarly-sized Airbus A320-200 can travel. Air Canada's intentions: The economy class seats are the widest in Air Canada's fleet at 19 inches. Frederick K. Larkin Photo By May 4, the airline expects to have received eight A220-300s. That day it will be using the aircraft to initiate two city-pairs: Montreal - Seattle, WA and Toronto - San Jose, Calif. With stage lengths/block times of 1,985 nm/5:50 and 1,950 nm/5:30, respectively, these new routes will permit the aircraft to demonstrate its transcontinental range capability. By the end of 2020, Air Canada expects to have 17 units in service. It plans on utilizing the airplane on new long and thin routes that can't support larger models; to increase frequencies on key spokes into its hubs at Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver; and to provide appropriate gauge on seasonal services. Other potential new city-pairs include Vancouver - Halifax and Vancouver - Washington, D.C. Regardless of how it may ultimately be deployed, the A220-300 is expected to act as a market share disruptor by diverting competitors' passenger traffic to Air Canada. A late bloomer matures: What began as Bombardier's new Commercial Aircraft Program in early 2004 has evolved into an extremely successful airliner in the 100-150-seat niche. By the end of 2019, 600 A220s had been ordered. Included in that tally were 95 A220-100s and 505 of the larger A220-300s. Aircraft delivered by the end of 2019 totalled 105, including 37 A220-100s and 68 A220-300s. The A220-100s owners included Delta and Swiss International. A220-300 owners were Air Canada, Air Baltic, Air Tanzania, Egyptair, State Transport Leasing of Russia, Korean Air and Swiss International. Sizeable orders for A220-300s from Air France and JetBlue Airways reinforce the enlightened decisions made by others before them. As a result of the growing interest in the aircraft, production is forecast to increase. During 2019, 48 A220s were delivered from the Mirabel facility. The Mirabel plant has a maximum annual capacity of 120 units. The new facility in Mobile, Ala., is gearing up to eventually produce 48 A220s per year for U.S. buyers. Since July 1, 2018, the A220 program has been owned by Airbus SE, Bombardier Inc. and Investissement Quebec. Given the challenges the program has overcome, it is gratifying to see this new Canadian aerospace icon being properly recognized by the global airline industry. As the largest Canadian airline places the largest Canadian designed and built jet aircraft into service, it is a remarkable way for the Canadian aviation industry to start the new decade.

In mid-April, the airline's outstanding Airbus A220 orders were postponed to 2023. With the new agreement, airBaltic gained an extra year to implement its fleet plans in the wake of novel coronavirus pandemic. \"The recent crisis enabled us to push forward our decision to introduce an Airbus A220-300 single type fleet. It allows us to minimize complexity and benefit from the additional efficiency provided by the aircraft. We will continue our growth and add more capacity provided by additional jets in the future as outlined by the Destination 2025 CLEAN business plan,\" said Martin Gauss, CEO of airBaltic. The Riga-based airline is the launch customer for the model and currently operates a total of 22 A220-300s. In early 2014, airBaltic will operate a single type fleet with 50 A220-300 aircraft. The airline also holds options for an additional 30 aircraft of the same type. With the delivery of three more aircraft, airBaltic is slated to operate 25 of this model by the end of 2020. airBaltic to Operate All A220-300 Fleet: This year, airBaltic prematurely phased out its Boeing 737-300 fleet and twelve Bombardier Q400 turboprops three years earlier than planned retirement schedule in a bid to operate all A220-300 fleet. \"We are the only airline in the world that operates the A220 exclusively. At the same time, this gives us the youngest fleet in the world with an average age of just 1.9 years. And the aircraft's price will fall even further because we are getting more planes,\" Gauss said in an exclusive interview with aero.de in Riga. The airline showed its confidence in the aircraft by stating that the 145-seat airliner performed beyond the company's expectations in terms of fuel efficiency and convenience for passengers and the staff. \"This aircraft offers an excellent flying experience with such benefits for passengers as wider seats, larger windows, more hand luggage space in the cabin, improved lavatories and much more,\" said the airline in a press release. In the current climate when the travel demand collapsed, airBaltic believes that it is in a strong position as the model can be operated both on long haul and short-haul routes. airBaltic suspended operations on March 17 due to the coronavirus outbreak and resumed flights on May 18.

The aircraft is due to begin operations on Nov. 10 and will join the sister aircraft, the Airbus A220-100, in the Atlanta-based carrier's narrowbody fleet. The airline will start operations out of Salt Lake City International Airport, which just opened its newest terminal this week, with routes to Austin and Houston officially bringing the aircraft online. These routes will dominate the A220-300's schedule until San Francisco to Salt Lake City transition to being operated by the A220-300 beginning Nov. 27 to accompany the preexisting routes. For Delta, the A220-300 will be configured in 130-seat, two-class formations. Delta's first class will consist of 12 seats in a 2-2 configuration while the main cabin and Delta Comfort+ will have 88 seats and 30 seats, respectively, in rows in a 2-3 configuration. The airline says that the aircraft will come equipped with WiFi, in-seat power for both outlets and USBs and satellite TV via personal video screens. These amenities are offered across all classes. A Long Journey: Delta's first A220-300 rolled off the Mobile, Ala. plant back in March but saw a delayed entry into service due to events outside the airline's control. The reduction in service saw old models leave while new models were delayed into service. However, as demand has returned and fleet trimming continues to occur, the new models gain more value and Delta sees today as the time to introduce the Bombardier- designed but Airbus-built model into service. The airline already has 31 Airbus A220-100s in service, and the aircraft has been in service for over a year. Delta's fleet evolution means that the A220 also has added more value over time. The airline recently retired the Boeing 737-700, McDonnell-Douglas MD-88 and McDonnell-Douglas MD-90 as the fleets were either aging or were seen as too niche to be kept in service. The retirement of these models, all of which held between 124 and 160 passengers, makes the addition of a 130-seat Airbus model more valuable for the airline as COVID-19 recovery continues. Delta will become the eighth operator of the larger A220 variant, following the likes of Swiss, airBaltic, Korean Air, Air Tanzania, EgyptAir, Air Canada and Air Sanai. Delta is the lone operator of the A220 in the U.S. and will eventually have the largest fleet when the 95 aircraft across the two types are delivered. The airline will eventually be joined by JetBlue and Breeze Airways, who have orders for 70 and 60 aircraft, respectively.", "url": "https://airlinegeeks.com/2020/09/27/delta-sets-november-entry-for-a220-300/"}, {"title": "EgyptAir receives final A220-300 aircraft from Airbus", "date": "2020-10-05", "content": "EgyptAir on Tuesday received its 12th and final Airbus 220-300 aircraft.

Yesterday, US hybrid carrier JetBlue took delivery of its first Airbus A220-300 aircraft. The plane arrived at New York's JFK yesterday evening. 2020 wasn't the best year for aircraft deliveries. Both Airbus and Boeing saw orders pushed back as airlines dealt with the global aviation crisis. After all, why would an airline want to take delivery of new aircraft when it wasn't flying the aircraft that it already has? There were a few exceptions, such as British Airways, who continued to take delivery of widebodies through the crisis. First A220 for the airline: JetBlue is currently expecting to take 70 Airbus A220 aircraft, all from the family's -300 variant. While the entire 70 aircraft fleet is still a long way off, a huge milestone was reached yesterday when JetBlue took delivery of its first A220-300, registered as N3008J. As Airbus raced to get orders counted in its 2020 delivery number, the A220 was delivered on December 31st before the new year kicked in. The aircraft departed from Mobile at 16:34, around an hour later than planned. According to data from FlightRadar24.com, the aircraft climbed to 41,000 feet for the journey to JFK, where it arrived at 19:35 after a two-hour flight. What to expect from the A220 experience: So far, it's not entirely clear what passengers will experience when flying onboard the Airbus A220. For the time being, JetBlue has left us with the teaser that its 'thoughtfully designed cabin interior' will be revealed during January. We have had some hints as to what to expect in the past, however. According to Seth Miller at Paxex.aero, the aircraft will have 140 seats. These will be in the A220's 2-3 configuration. This would put it at one row less than the A220-300's launch customer, airBaltic. JetBlue previously told us that the seats would have the most legroom in an economy cabin based on average fleet-wide seat pitch. Also, the A220s will offer free 'Fly-Fi' WiFi, offering live television on most routes. An Embraer E190 replacement: JetBlue is angling the A220-300 as a replacement for its E190 fleet. The A220-300 will also allow the airline to expand slightly. While the E190 fleet currently consists of 60 aircraft, JetBlue has ordered ten extra A220s. The A220 fleet will replace JetBlue's E190 aircraft. Photo: Getty Images According to the airline, the A220 will cost 30% less to operate per seat than the E190.

On March 22, Air Canada performed the customer acceptance flight for the new A220-300 at the Airbus factory in Mirabel, Quebec. According to Kevin Mio, the airline's manager of corporate communications, the retrojet will begin revenue service in early April and will be assigned to traditional A220 routes, which will see it criss-crossing North America. Plane spotters across the continent will be on the lookout for the heritage livery, which was applied by 75 Airbus employees over a period of nine days. A total of four colors and 350 liters of paint were used. The paint was applied using a new, more environmentally friendly process that is chromium free with a low volatile organic compound content. The new method requires much less water, saving more than 10,000 liters per aircraft paint job. While the TCA logo featured a red maple leaf, the Air Canada name and rondelle logo were not officially adopted until Jan. 1, 1965. \"Painting the A220 allows Air Canada to keep a connection to the airline's rich heritage as the nation's flag carrier,\" said Mio.

It was initially ordered for Russian leisure airlines Red Wings, based out of Moscow's Domodedovo, but was never taken up by the carrier. Awaiting recertification after a two-year pause: Air Manas was founded in 2006 and commenced flights in 2009. Three years later, Turkish leisure airline Pegasus acquired 49% of the shares in the carrier and rebranded it as Pegasus Asia. The airline operated a fleet of three Boeing 737s. However, in 2019, Pegasus sold its shares, and Air Manas ceased operations. After being dormant for two years, the Kyrgyz airline now intends to relaunch operations with funding from the Eurasia Development Bank and the A220. According to CH-Aviation, Air Manas plans to add one more of the type and operate its new and shiny jets on domestic routes and international services to other CIS countries and Asia. However, it must first gain recertification, as its Air Operator Certificate expired in January 2020. Granted that it does, the airline plans to relaunch operations during the summer. All carriers, including Air Manas, certified by the authorities responsible for regulatory oversight of Kyrgyzstan, are blacklisted by the European Union and banned from operating in the bloc. Geared turbofan P&W powerhouse: The A220 is powered by Pratt & Whitney's GTF engines which recently completed one million flight hours. P&W says that the geared turbofan powerhouses deliver double-digit improvements in fuel and carbon emissions and a 75% reduction in noise footprint. Furthermore, they produce half of the NOx emissions allowed by ICAO regulations. \"We are delighted to welcome the first GTF-powered A220 aircraft to the fleet.

But what's more interesting is what JetBlue is still NOT ordering! The A220 is going from strength to strength, for Airbus. A design that Bombardier developed in part to compete with Airbus, is now an Airbus. Unsurprisingly then, it is doing a reasonably good job in terms of competing with older single aisles. And this is something that could well be relevant to this news story. On the face of it, this order isn't particularly surprising. So far, JetBlue had orders for a total of 70 A220-300 single-aisle jets. The airline has already taken delivery of eight of them, as of this writing. It has configured them with 140 seats, in an all-economy layout. By all accounts, the type has gotten a good reception. The 2+3 cabin layout is fresher and roomier than that of the Embraer E190s that they are replacing. A220-300 - The New JetBlue Order\uff1a The new JetBlue order for 30 A220-300 airliners comes as the Singapore Airshow gets underway. And even if such a top-up order isn't a surprise, it comes with some interesting numbers. Until now, the biggest overall A220 customer was Delta Air Lines, with 95 of them. But its orders are split among two types: 45 A220-100s and 50 of the bigger A220-300s. Within the A220-300 sub-type, the biggest single customer was Breeze, with 80 aircraft on order. Well, not anymore. JetBlue is now on top on both counts, with plans for a total of 100 A220-300 airliners. This makes the A220 the type that JetBlue has the most orders for. The airline has clearly committed heavily to the aircraft. Its new A321neos have Pratt & Whitney engines of the same GTF family as the A220s. This bodes well for the airline's long-term maintenance and support planning, as well. But... this is far from the whole picture. In January last year, we wrote about JetBlue and about something... unclear in its A220-300 orders. Nominally at least, JetBlue is getting these planes to replace its 60 E190s. This was plausible when the airline had orders for 70 - a small expansion being normal, in planning. But the strategy begins to hold less water when we bump the A220 order to 100 jets. And obviously, JetBlue's E190s have 100 seats each, while the A220s have 140. The A220-300 Vs The Rest Of The JetBlue Fleet: As we pointed out last year, the role that JetBlue has in mind for its A220-300 fleet becomes clearer, once we look at its other planes. So let's see how the airline is getting on, a year later. Starting from the bigger jets, JetBlue has 63 older A321ceos. Well - \"older\" is marginally appropriate; they have the older engines but average just over five years of age. The airline has orders for 64 A321neos to replace them. But obviously, some of the older A321s will stay on for a while yet. This gives the airline some time to expand, using old and new A321s. However, it's the A320ceo that's the real mainstay of the JetBlue fleet. The airline has 130 of these. And age-wise, they're going past their prime already, with an average age of over sixteen years! So, to replace them, JetBlue has orders for... Nothing. In theory, anyway. You can probably see where this is going. No, the A220-300 isn't a like-for-like replacement, for the A320 JetBlue fleet. Those older jets have 150 seats, to the A220's 140. But the newer jet has a substantially lower cost-per-seat; over 20%, according to some sources. However, JetBlue would need to place more A220-300 orders, if it really wants to replace all of its A320s. The Prelude To A Stretch Variant? Once again: the A220-300 is not, repeat NOT a regional plane. That's more or less what Boeing thought - and regretted it, as we saw! Bombardier designed the CSeries to operate from regional airports, yes. But the planes have the range to join very distant small airports. And internally, they are roomier than other single-aisle jets. Plus, JetBlue would not be the first airline to first consider the A320neo, then look at the A220-300 instead. So a year on, it seems that the A220-300's appeal over the A320neo hasn't diminished. So, could this give Airbus the push, to launch a bigger A220-500? As we've seen, the plane's original design factored in such an eventuality. So this wouldn't be an afterthought, as with other designs. Plus, Airbus officials have confirmed that they have completed the A220-500's engineering design. It's a question of when, not if. With customers like JetBlue placing more A220-300 orders, Airbus isn't in a hurry. But this could change later, when the A220's production begins to ramp up. For now, Airbus can only make 5 of them per month and has 700 on order. In all likelihood, the A220 program will go up a gear if/when Boeing launches a new aircraft!", "url": "https://mentourpilot.com/jetblue-orders-more-airbus-a220-300-narrowbodies/"}, {"title": "Airbus Deploys airBaltic A220-300 on Marketing Flight to Sydney, Singapore, Hanoi and Tokyo", "date": "2022-05-03", "content": "Airbus has deployed an airBaltic A220-300 on a demonstration flight to Sydney, Singapore, Hanoi and Tokyo.

The tenth A220-300: Today, the company has reached a symbolic milestone, with the arrival of its 10th Airbus A220-300, the latest jewel in its medium-haul fleet. The aircraft, with registration number F-HZUJ, left the Airbus assembly line in Mirabel to join Paris-Charles de Gaulle, where it will operate the company's short and medium-haul flights. It will operate its first commercial flight to Venice on 5th July 2022. The aircraft sports its new name \"Auvers-sur-Oise\" at the front of its fuselage, in reference to the town north of Paris which is internationally known for the landscape and impressionist painters Paul C\u00e9zanne, Camille Corot and Vincent Van Gogh. The Dutch painter spent his last days in Auvers-sur-Oise during a period of intense creativity. Since 2019 and the delivery of its first Airbus A350, Air France has revived the tradition of naming its aircraft after French towns. Auvers-sur-Oise is the 96 th town to be honoured on the company's aircraft. Between now and the end of 2025, 60 A220-300s will gradually replace some of Air France's medium-haul aircraft. With up to 15 deliveries scheduled each year, this is the fastest fleet integration of an aircraft in the history of Air France. An aircraft boasting an improved economic and environmental performance: The most innovative and efficient single-aisle aircraft in its category, the Airbus A220-300 is perfectly suited to Air France's short and medium-haul network. It provides a cost reduction per seat of 10% compared to the Airbus A318 and A319 and stands out for its energy efficiency, consuming 20% less fuel than the aircraft it replaces and its CO2 emissions are also reduced by 20%. Its noise footprint is also 34% lower. These characteristics will play a decisive role in reducing Air France's environmental footprint and achieving its sustainable development objectives. Within the framework of its \"Air France ACT\" programme, the company is targeting a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger/km by 2030 compared to 2019. This target excludes so-called \"offsetting\" actions in order to exclusively take into account measures that strictly reduce direct and indirect emissions. Heading for Europe: This summer, the Air France Airbus A220-300 serves Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, Milan-Linate, Milan-Malpensa, Bologna, Rome, Naples and Venice, Barcelona, Valencia and Madrid, Lisbon, Copenhagen, Athens, Helsinki, Vienna, Warsaw and Stockholm on departure from the Air France hub at Paris- Charles de Gaulle. Optimal comfort on board: This aircraft has 148 seats, in a 3-2 seat configuration offering 80% of customers a window or aisle seat. The seat is the widest of the market for single-aisle aircraft. It is reclining and features an adjustable headrest, leather upholstery and an ergonomic seat cushion for enhanced comfort. A wide solid tray table, cup holder, a pouch for storing magazines and books, individual USB A and C ports and a tablet or smartphone holder integrated into the backrest complete the package.

This is a true success story for the aircraft developed and assembled in Quebec, at Airbus Canada's Mirabel headquarters, and whose footprint has also expanded to the United States with the addition of a second assembly site. The 220th A220 - an A220-300 - was recently delivered to JetBlue, the largest A220 customer with 100 A220s on order and already 10 in service. Beyond a symbol, the 220th A220 marks an important milestone for Airbus and its successful single-aisle Family six years after the first aircraft - an A220-100 - was handed over to the Programme's launch operator SWISS International Air Lines. A game-changing aircraft for operators: Six years later, the A220 continuously attracts operators and passengers, offering both high flexibility - from 30 minutes to seven hours flights - and efficiency - with 25% less fuel burn & CO2 emissions and 50% less noise footprint compared to previous generation aircraft. And many airlines across the world including Air Canada, Air France and JetBlue have selected the A220 to reach their environmental targets, as part of a collective effort to lead the aerospace industry's decarbonisation journey. To date, the A220 Family proudly flies in the liveries of more than 15 airlines on over 700 routes and 300 destinations worldwide. \"If 25 customers have ordered more than 760 A220 aircraft to date, it's because it's the best aircraft in its category, the one that allows them to be more efficient in their operations and reduce their carbon footprint. Today, 220 A220s are sporting our expertise around the world and have carried over 60 million passengers. We have a lot to be proud of. \" - Beno\u00eet Schultz, Airbus Canada CEO. Opening new horizons for passengers: In the last six years, the A220 has been able to unlock numerous routes for passengers from North America to Asia Pacific, Africa and Europe, connecting around 60 millions passengers who enjoyed a bright cabin with large panoramic windows, wider seats, offering them superior comfort and personal space. On the North American continent, where the A220 is headquartered and built, airlines such as JetBlue, Breeze Airways, Air Canada and Delta Air Lines, have always been focused on the passenger experience, and the A220 fits perfectly with that philosophy by offering true widebody comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. This is also the case in Europe with Latvia-based airBaltic which has been flying an exclusive A220-300 fleet since 2020 and has made the A220 its operation backbone offering passengers a unique flying experience. In the U.S., the A220 is also highly appreciated for providing non-stop service between underserved routes at affordable fares, offering point-to-point flights from smaller secondary airports, and bypassing hubs for shorter travel times. Meeting the growing demand: With an A220 order book that has more than doubled since 2018, Airbus is expanding its industrial footprint to support the increasing demand for the A220. In addition to the headquartered final assembly line in Mirabel, Canada, Airbus extended its A220 assembly capacity to the U.S.-based A320 FAL located in Mobile, Alabama in January 2019. More recently, Mirabel welcomed an additional pre-assembly line, becoming the first Airbus pre-FAL located outside of Europe. This expansion will allow Airbus to more than double the current A220 production rates to 14 aircraft per month by the middle of this decade and meet a market need estimated to represent at least 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years, namely due to the current acceleration in aging aircraft fleet replacement needs.

The aircraft was originally headed from Zurich to Stuttgart but ultimately ended up back in Zurich, grounded for 48 hours. Aircraft and incident details: The incident in question took place on Saturday, November 5th and involved a SWISS Airbus A220-300. Operating flight LX1164 from Zurich to Stuttgart, the aircraft departed at 07:26 local time. According to The Aviation Herald, the jet was climbing out of Zurich's runway 32 when an \"acrid odor\" was detected by the crew less than five minutes after takeoff. The crew then stopped the climb at FL080 and made the decision to return to Zurich. The aircraft then landed safely on runway 34, approximately 15 minutes after departure. The aircraft in question is registered HB-JCP and was delivered to the airline in August 2018. Built by Bombardier and initially designated the CSeries CS300, the aircraft is now nearly four and a half years old. After acquiring the CSeries program from Bombardier, Airbus officially renamed the type the A220 in July 2018. Aircraft re-allocation and passenger re-accommodation: The Aviation Herald notes that a replacement A220-300 registered HB-JCQ was assigned to take over for flight LX1164. The jet departed Zurich at 09:16 local time and arrived at Stuttgart at 09:45. As for the incident aircraft, it remained on the ground in Zurich for the remainder of November 5th and the entirety of November 6th. However, the jet resumed service on November 7th at 07:46, flying from Zurich to D\u00fcsseldorf. The second \"cockpit smell\" issue within two months: Quite interestingly, a very similar situation took place in early September. Indeed, the A220-100 registered HB-JBG was flying from Manchester to Zurich on September 2nd when the crew made the decision to divert to Frankfurt due to a strange-smelling odor in the cockpit. The aircraft involved in this incident ended up staying on the ground at Frankfurt airport for three full days, eventually returning to Zurich on September 5th. The A220 in the SWISS fleet: There are now 30 Airbus A220s flying for SWISS. The airline, through its parent company Lufthansa Group, was one of the first carriers to order the jet, known at the time as the CSeries. In fact, the carrier was the launch customer of the type, first operating the CS100 in 2016. The A220's early years of service have presented a few issues for SWISS. Most incidents involved the type's Pratt and Whitney geared turbofan engines. In one 2019 case, an A220 had to divert to Paris after flames were reportedly observed coming from the engine. Less than two weeks later, it was revealed that software settings might have caused the issues. Later in the year, it was revealed that problems arose only after a software update was released. The software supposedly allowed the engine to behave in a manner that allowed for destructive vibrations.

Moreover, at the moment it is the greenest commercial aircraft in the world, as it is the first aircraft to have a transparent declaration of the life-cycle environmental impact, helping to reduce CO2 and NOX emissions by 20% and 50% respectively.

The AD, which is a final rulemaking, was published on December 27, 2022, with an effective date of January 31, 2023. The dual-engine shutdown occurred as the aircraft landed, compromising the braking capability of the narrow-body aircraft, as the crew lost engine power and the ability to control hydraulic systems. The FAA did not specify when the event occurred. However, the Aviation Safety Network recorded an incident in July 2021 in which an airBaltic Airbus A220-300, registered as YL-AAQ, suffered a dual-engine shutdown as it landed at Copenhagen Airport. According to the FAA, following an investigation into the matter, it determined that \"the sequence of the auto-throttle increasing throttle to maintain Mach number, immediately followed by pilot command to decrease throttle to idle, caused a transient disagreement between actual and commanded thrust.\" As a result, the disagreement triggered a thrust control malfunction detection logic, and the aircraft shut down both engines as soon as wheel sensors detected that the aircraft had physically landed on the runway. To prevent such a situation from occurring in the future/again, operators will have to remove certain electronic engine control full authority digital engine control software versions and replace them with updated software. \"This software update makes corrective improvements to the TCM logic, including revised criteria for triggering the TCM logic and establishing criteria that permit the TCM logic to unlatch during flight,\" concluded the FAA. Air Line Pilots Association, International was the only party to comment on the directive, wholeheartedly agreeing with the change. The government agency estimated the software update would take two hours at a cost of $170 per aircraft. Since the AD affects 147 engines that are equipped on aircraft that are registered in the US, the FAA estimated the total cost for operators in the country to be $24,990.
