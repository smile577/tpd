The first parts have now been produced and Saab is gearing up for assembly and delivery. The agreement between Saab and Airbus includes the design, development and manufacturing of the flap support structures and fairings for the Airbus A350-1000 for the entire duration of the programme. The A350-1000 is the longest-fuselage version of Airbus' all-new family of widebody jetliners, measuring nearly 74 metres from nose to tail. Flap support structures link the landing flaps to the wing trailing-edge structure and allow the deployment of the flaps during the take-off and landing phases. Saab is now gearing up for assembly and initial delivery of structural parts for the A350-1000. \"The first parts have been produced and we are pleased with the results. The next step is to start up our in-house assembly line where the parts will be assembled,\" says Dan Lagerberg, Project Manager for the A350-1000 project at Saab. When the A350 XWB (extra wide body) agreement was signed between Saab and Airbus, it marked a breakthrough with yet another Airbus platform for Saab, confirming the company's competitiveness as a global supplier to the commercial aviation market. Saab also supplies the A320 programme, producing ailerons and the A380 programme, producing the mid and outer leading edges. \"We are making good progress in the A350-1000 project,\" says Dan Lagerberg, \"we have a tight schedule, but the whole project and supply-chain are geared up for the challenge and now it is full steam ahead towards completing the first delivery.\"", "url": "https://www.saab.com/newsroom/stories/2015/january/parts-for-the-airbus-a350-1000-produced-at-saab"}, {"title": "Rolls Preps A350-1000's Big Trent XWB-97 for Tests on A380 FTB", "date": "2015-06-12", "content": "With the Airbus A350-900 now in service, engine producer Rolls-Royce is turning its attention to the A350-1000 and the Trent XWB-97 engine, which is based on the -900's Trent XWB-84. There also still is a significant \"industrialization\" effort going on for the -84, as production ramps up and more airlines take delivery. The A350-1000 is due to enter service in 2017. Simon Burr, who was promoted to be R-R's chief operating officer for civil large engines in May, spoke to reporters three weeks ago referring to his experience running the Trent XWB program until recently. He said the XWB-97 would make its first flight next year on Airbus's A380 flying testbed, and has \"the largest fan Rolls-Royce has ever produced\" -118 inches in diameter. For now, the first test engine completed 150 hours of ground testing since its first run in July 2014. \"It's already gone to 99,000 pounds force,\" said Burr. He added that engine is now being rebuilt to be ready for bird-ingestion and rail/hail tests this summer. The key engine, however, is the flying testbed, which will be close to the production standard and will be the first engine to fly. \"The engine is coming together and will run in June and will be delivered to Toulouse in July so Airbus can pod it. This is a big milestone because in creating the FTB flying testbed you have to create all the tests associated with the production engine.\" With respect to a target certification date Burr would say only that, \"It will be done when it's ready, but way in advance of the aircraft flying ... and that's due to be in the second half of next year.\" After the first 150 hours of engine runs the company made \"some adjustments mainly to the combustor thermal profile,\" said Burr. Of the other test engines, 20022 will be used for endurance, 20023 for performance and fan testing, 20026 for icing and maturity, 20024 for the turbine and air system, and 20025 for telemetry testing. Compared with the -84 the -97 engine is, obviously, larger with more thrust. It will \"turn faster and run hotter to get the additional thrust,\" said Burr, who was quick to say that \"the engine is still very comfortable.\" In addition, he said, the fan has been \"tweaked\" aerodynamically. The result has been to obtain another 13,000 pounds of thrust with the same fuel efficiency, with the fan turning 6 percent faster than with the -84 to get a higher volume throughput. The core of the engine is scaled up by 5 percent over the -84 and has unshrouded HPT blades. Overall, however, the company has come down on the side of commonality wherever possible, with 80 percent of line replaceable units being common on the XWB engines. XWB-84 in Service: With the first A350-900s having entered service with Qatar Airways, R-R is now working on an XWB-84 \"maturity program,\" alongside the industrialization. \"Vietnam is shortly to get their first aircraft; the engines have been delivered already. And we've built the first engine for Finnair ... and TAM will be toward the end of the year. We're 100 percent on time on delivery for our engines,\" said Burr. The industrialization is \"very important because of the order book.\" \"Rolls-Royce has invested huge amounts in its facilities, such as UK Discs.\" This plant in Washington, Tyne and Wear, UK, is designed to produce 2,500 fan and turbine discs a year. Meanwhile, R-R has \"put in a pulse line for engine assembly in Derby, which Burr described as \"a big step forward in how we build our engines.\" This was matured first in the Trent 1000 facility in Singapore; that engine powers the Boeing 787.

Barring bad weather that could lead to a postponement, Thursday's roughly three-hour debut will add a new 366-seat member to the lightweight carbon- fibre A350 family, which entered service with the smaller A350-900 early last year. It is part of a game of leapfrog at the top of the market for twin-engined long-haul jets, as the dominant planemakers vie to outdo each other in size and efficiency in a category expected to generate $1 trillion in orders over the next 20 years. It is also at the center of a new subsidy row between Europe and the United States at a time of protectionist pressures on both sides of the Atlantic. The World Trade Organization is expected to rule in coming days that Boeing received at least one strand of banned support for its response to the A350-1000, known as the 777X. Airbus said the A350-1000, a stretched version of the model which entered service last year, was scheduled to take off from its Toulouse base at around 0930 GMT on Thursday, returning there later, in an outing that marks the start of roughly a year of flight testing. The United States says the plane and its smaller A350 sister model could only get off the drawing board thanks to damaging European subsidies, in a dispute likely to rumble on long after the A350-1000 enters service in the second half of 2017. The aircraft, which sells for $356 million at list prices, is designed to compete with Boeing's 777-300ER, the most successful version of the U.S. planemaker's popular 777 family. Airbus hopes it will help it reach 50 percent of wide-body aircraft deliveries, up from 35 percent in 2015. But critics say the aircraft failed to deliver the knockout blow to the older 777 it had hoped, despite an upgrade in engine design. Airbus has sold 195 new-generation A350-1000s out of 810 total A350 orders, compared with 809 sales of the 777-300ER. LEAPFROG: Unwilling to cede a lucrative spot at the top of the market for twin-engined jets, Boeing responded by launching the \"777X\", including the 406-seat 777-9. That has in turn sent its European rival looking for new and bigger solutions. Even before taking flight, industry sources say the A350-1000 has been eclipsed by a potential 400-seat version called A350-2000 which is being offered to key airlines, though Airbus recently deferred a decision on whether to develop it. In one final throw of the dice, Boeing is mulling plans for an even larger \"777-10X\" which could seat some 450 people. Singapore Airlines could make a decision on which of those two concept jets to order by year-end, CNN reported this month. \"The category killer has been the 777-300ER and the A350-1000 fits there. The question is where the market is?: The sweet spot may not be the largest aircraft, but manufacturers don't yet know,\" said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham. The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric GE.N and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce RR.L. But by conquering 400 seats, the rise of the \"big twin\" raise questions over demand for slightly larger four-engined jets like the A380 and Boeing 747-8, whose sales are weak. The trend was highlighted as recently as June. While Airbus celebrated a much- needed order boost from Virgin Atlantic, people familiar with the matter said the airline had decided behind the scenes to cancel its remaining orders for A380s. Adding to pressure on both planemakers as they stretch their designs, Thursday's debut coincides with a dip in demand for wide-body jets due to a surge of aircraft scheduled to be delivered later this decade and concerns over the economy. Boeing said last month it saw \"hesitation\" from airlines over such planes, but insisted long-term demand was sound.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-a350-idUSKBN13I18I"}, {"title": "Airbus's largest A350 jet carries out its maiden flight", "date": "2016-11-24", "content": "Europe's largest twin-engined passenger jet, the Airbus AIR.PA A350-1000, took to the skies for the first time on Thursday, seeking to grab the spotlight from Boeing's popular 777. The lightweight carbon-fiber plane, 7 meters longer and able to carry 40 more people than A350s already in service, began a three-hour debut flight at 4.42 a.m ET, watched by some of the airline bosses who have invested in the $356 million jet. It later returned to base after a 4 hour and 20 minute flight during which co-pilot Frank Chapman said it had performed \"smoothly\", similar to its sister plane the A350-900. The 366-seat A350-1000 is designed to break Boeing's BA.N virtual monopoly in the lucrative \"mini-jumbo\" segment, typically involving large twin-engined jets carrying 350 people. It is larger than the new-generation A350-900, which entered service last year. Both are built from similar advanced materials to Boeing's mid-sized 787 Dreamliner in a race between planemakers for fuel savings and better passenger comfort. The aircraft involved in Thursday's Toulouse debut is one of three test planes facing 1,600 hours of intensive flight testing before the A350-1000 enters service in the second half of 2017. Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of the planemaking division of Airbus Group, told Reuters he was confident the A350-1000 would be delivered on time to launch customer Qatar Airways. \"It makes me very happy and very proud. We are flying according to the timetable we had planned,\" he said moments after the jet, weighing 230 tonnes, took off under leaden skies to applause from factory workers. GRAPPLING WITH OTHER DELAYS: Bregier added he had grown more confident of reaching this year's target of at least 50 A350-900 deliveries. While the first flight of its latest model took place on time, Airbus is grappling with delivery delays to the A350-900, clusters of which remain dotted around the airport in Toulouse, France, due to shortages of cabin equipment. Smaller A320neo jets are also parked with missing engines, due to delays in supplies from Pratt & Whitney, highlighting the strain on the industry of adding new technology while securing record production targets. Airbus programs chief Didier Evrard said the planemaker continued to scrutinize its suppliers, notably France's Zodiac Aerospace ZODC.PA, which said this week it was on a path to recovery following a production crisis at its factories. Asked about the progress displayed by cabin and other suppliers for the A350 family, Evrard told Reuters: \"It has improved, but it is not where it should be and we are watching them very carefully.\" He said the planemaker was working hard to achieve the target of 50 A350-900 deliveries this year, having reached 34 so far, with a further plane due to be delivered later on Thursday. \"I have already canceled my holidays,\" he added. Airbus says the A350-1000 will be 25 percent cheaper to operate than the competing Boeing 777-300ER, an older aircraft which weighs more but which has more seats in some layouts. Boeing has responded to the A350-1000 by developing an even larger version of 777 able to seat over 400 people, making it the largest twin-engined jet when it enters service in 2020. Airbus is also considering whether to go up in size with a further stretch of the A350, but senior marketing vice president Francois Caudron said it did not currently deem this necessary. Industry sources say Airbus is nonetheless offering the potential \"A350-2000\" to influential buyers including Singapore Airlines SIAL.SI and British Airways ICAG.L. Such a jet would need an enhancement of the Rolls-Royce RR.L Trent XWB engine that powers the A350-1000, already one of the industry's largest with a fan case large enough to swallow the fuselage of the now defunct Concorde. Chris Young, programs director at the embattled UK engine manufacturer, which is in the midst of restructuring, said it would always be ready if needed to upgrade its engines or add new ones according to the needs of airplane manufacturers.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-a350-idUSKBN13J0ZS"}, {"title": "A350-1000 takes off on maiden flight", "date": "2016-11-26", "content": "Airbus has commenced the flight-test campaign for the A350-1000 with the variant becoming airborne for the first time at Toulouse. The aircraft, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, lifted off at 10:42 local time. It marks a crucial step in the airframer's attempt to enter the 'big twin' sector, in the 350-400 seat category, following its previous development of the smaller A300 and A310, the A330 and the A350-900. The A350-1000 will typically seat 366 passengers and Airbus is marketing the aircraft as having a range of 7,950nm. Conceived as an 11-frame stretch of the -900, the aircraft underwent a revision in 2011 to extend its range and provide broader appeal to operators. The wing is modified from that on the -900, with an extended trailing edge, and Rolls-Royce enhanced the powerplants to deliver 97,000lb thrust rather than the previous 93,000lb. Deliveries of the aircraft are scheduled to begin in the second half of 2017, some two years later than the pre-revamp schedule, which enabled Airbus to concentrate on the re-engined A320neo and allow a degree of technological insertion derived from the A350-900 development. Airbus has invested heavily in the A350-1000, intending to capitalise on a lucrative sector which has been left exclusively to Boeing since it developed the 777-300ER. The 777-300ER was first delivered to airline customers - among them Air France and Japan Airlines - in mid-2004, and the total orders for the twinjet variant edged over the 800 mark in October. Airbus's highest-capacity aircraft at the time, the A340-600, had entered service two years earlier than the 777-300ER but its four-engined design rapidly lost favour against the twin-engined economics of the Boeing. The airframer sold only 97 A340-600s, and Airbus's weak opposition to the 777-300ER's lure yielded completely in 2011 when A340 production ceased. Airbus is nearing 200 orders for the A350-1000, two-thirds of them picked up since the 2011 design overhaul. While the revision had proven controversial among earlier customers for the aircraft, Airbus would point to high-profile orders from British Airways, United Airlines, Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific as endorsements for its decision. Airbus also notes that the -1000's figures have been lifted by the conversion of a number of A350-900 orders from customers including LATAM and lessor Air Lease. The -1000's maiden flight takes place at a crucial node in the development of large twin-engined jets, with the dominance of the 777-300ER waning - a production cut is due next year - as Airbus puts forward more substantial competition and Boeing works on its 777X successor. Airbus estimates that the intermediate twin-aisle market for the next 20 years amounts to nearly 2,600 aircraft of which around half will be delivered to Asia-Pacific carriers.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161124221344/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/a350-1000-takes-off-on-maiden-flight-431788/"}, {"title": "Airbus details duty schedule for A350-1000 test fleet", "date": "2016-11-28", "content": "Airbus's flight-test programme for the A350-1000 will stretch to 1,600h, split almost evenly between the three test aircraft. The airframer has detailed the schedule following the maiden flight of the first A350-1000, MSN59, on 24 November. This aircraft is set to carry out 600h of testing, dealing primarily with the flight envelope, systems and powerplant checks on its Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines. As part of the initial phase, it will be used to assess aerodynamic performance and determine the final aeronautical configuration of the variant. Aircraft MSN71 will be the second to become airborne, with a scheduled 500h of testing set to include the cold and warm campaigns, and landing-gear checks, as well as high-altitude testing. Both MSN59 and MSN71 will be fitted with heavy test equipment. But the third airframe, MSN65, will have a lighter test installation, and will be configured with an interior layout for cabin development and certification. This aircraft - also set to conduct 500h of flight tests - will be used for route proving and extending twin-engined operations assessment. Airbus says the schedule amounts to a \"reduced\" campaign which will \"focus\" on the A350-1000's specific features. MSN59, which will handle much of the basic flight-testing burden, will be fitted with up to 15 video cameras as part of the certification programme. Three flight-test engineers will man an aircraft monitoring station while two specialists will handle engine monitoring. Some 3,300 measurements will be analysed by around 220 sensors, and the aircraft will be fitted with transferable water-glycol ballast tanks capable of shifting 10t of liquid from the forward to the aft freight holds in 4min. The aircraft can also be fitted with a 51-seat flight-test cabin for transporting ground-support and engineering personnel. Flight-test work will be monitored on the ground by telemetry stations in Toulouse, Bremen, Hamburg and Filton, while a Dassault Falcon 20 chase aircraft will be deployed for airborne assessment support. MSN59 will eventually be used to support entry into service work, once its flight campaign has concluded. Airbus says the flight schedule for the Trent XWB-97 engine - fitted to the MSN1 A380 testbed - comprised an initial 148h between November last year and April this year. It is undergoing a second series of tests, which began in July, which is set to total 157h by the end of this year.

The latest Aircraft Characteristics for Airport and Maintenance Planning guide (ACAP) for A350 increases the aircraft's maximum weight before fuel is loaded and its maximum take-off weight. At the same time, the A350-900ULR variant's maximum take-off weight is now available as a standard weight variant (no 10). Improvements for A350-1000: During the certification tests of a new aircraft, it's verified if an aircraft can fly with a higher load than originally planned. Static and fatigue strength tests reveal if the aircraft structure has margins. Flight tests (especially the spectacular Vmu test, the one where the tail is scraped in the runway to test minimum lift-off speed) show if the planned flight characteristics are present. For most of these tests, the aircraft is designed with a margin. When these margins are not consumed by reality, the performance data for the aircraft can be improved. One of the most performance affecting areas are the aircraft weights. When weights can be increased without compromises in airfield performance, the payload or range of the aircraft improves. Range is dictated by how much fuel can be filled, once the aircraft is filled with passenger and cargo (the payload). For a given empty weight and payload, a higher Max Take-Off Weight (MTOW) will increase available fuel and therefore range. The weight increase for -1000 goes from the planned 308t for Weight Variant 1 (WV001) to 311t for WV002 and finally 316t for WV003.

Speaking yesterday at Airbus's opening show briefing, A350 XWB marketing director Francois Obe highlighted Asia as one of the A350-1000's most important markets. In fact, three of its 11 customers-Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Asiana-hail from the region and account for 43 of the 169 total units on order. The A350-1000 received type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last November, after three flight test examples spent more than 1,600 hours in the air, including 150 hours dedicated to tests performed in an airline-like environment to demonstrate readiness for service entry. Unfortunately for Airbus, the specially configured business class interiors for launch customer Qatar Airways proved not ready for service in time for planned first delivery by the end of last year. The unique seating configuration Qatar calls its Qsuite features seats that face each other and lie-flat double beds. Nevertheless, the fact that the A350-1000 shares some 95-percent common part numbers with its smaller sibling, the A350-900, contributed to the smooth certification effort and relatively short flight test program, said Obe. Meanwhile, the -1000 also demonstrated better airfield performance than expected, exceeding takeoff weight predictions by 5.3 metric tons out of Riyadh, 7.2 metric tons out of Newark and 3.8 metric tons out of Johannesburg. Carrying 366 passengers in a typical three-class configuration, or 40 more than the A350-900 holds, the -1000 features an extended wing trailing edge for lower approach speeds, new six-wheel main landing gear to accommodate its higher weight and, of course, more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines.

The \"dash 1000\" variant of the A350 is now the largest twin-engine jet Airbus has ever produced. The jet was initially to be delivered late last year, but complications installing the airline's new Qsuite business class seats forced the target date to slip into the new year. The new seats have already been installed in some of Qatar's other aircraft, but it took than expected to adapt the new-design to the newer A350-1000s. \"It is very difficult to install a new program in a new airplane, especially the first one,\" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said at a press conference prior to the delivery. Qatar will fly the aircraft's first commercial flight Saturday between Doha and London Heathrow. The carrier will eventually work the jet into longer routes between Doha and the East Coast of the United States, according to Al Baker. Airbus says the airplane can fly up to 7,950 nautical miles non-stop, making it capable of connecting Boston and Shanghai, or Paris and Santiago, Chile. The -1000 is the second variant of the A350 family to be delivered to an airline. It joins its older-but-smaller sibling -- the -900 -- the first of which was first delivered to Qatar Airways in late 2014. The jets are manufactured with lightweight carbon-fiber composite materials instead of the more traditional aluminum. This change allows for greater fuel efficiency and more flier-friendly features, such as larger windows and lower cabin humidity. A number of other carriers have since taken deliveries of Airbus' A350, including Delta, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, LATAM, Singapore Airlines and Vietnam Airlines, among others. As for the -1000 variant, it's now Airbus' largest twin-engine jet to ever enter service. At 242 feet long, the jet can haul up to 440 passengers in an all-economy configuration or 366 in a more-typical three class layout. However, sales of the -1000 variant have been sluggish with airlines showing increasing wariness about purchasing - and then having to fill - larger airplanes. Boeing's 777 program has fallen victim to the same fate, with its new 777X receiving record-busting orders after launch only to slow to a few dozen tepid commitments in the years since. In the case of Airbus, a handful of airlines -- including Cathay Pacific and United Airlines -- have opted to swap previous orders for -1000 in favor of the smaller -900. As a result Airbus says it is not presently pursuing plans for a third, even bigger version of the A350. The company had been toying with the idea for some time as a more direct competitor to Boeing's 777X, but has backed off the plan in the absence of a stronger business case for moving ahead. Despite the sluggish sales and unfavorable trends, Airbus has not given up hope for the A350-1000. \"I believe sales will open up,\" outgoing Airbus COO Fabrice Bregier said here. Airbus' newest aircraft -- the A350 XWB -- passed through Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport on July 19, 2015. Airbus was showing this A350-900 as part of a A350 demonstration tour of the USA. \"The big wave of replacement of Boeing's 777-300ER, which we target with the -1000, will start around 2020-23,\" he said, adding that now was the time for the company's sales team to kick into high gear. \"It is time to be much more aggressive, to explain to Boeing's customers that this aircraft will be the better choice than the 777-9X,\" he said. That will leave Airbus on something of a barnstorming sales tour across the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, a move that it hopes will drum up more orders for the -1000. The company is betting on huge growth from Asia-Pacific in particular, forecasting a need for some 4,000 new widebody jets in the coming decade.

Business Traveller is in Toulouse for the delivery ceremony of the A350-1000 and will be on the delivery flight to Hong Kong this afternoon. The airline follows launch customer Qatar Airways, which received its first A350-1000 in February this year. Airbus currently has 168 orders for the new aircraft from 11 customers, though it has yet to confirm which airline will be the third to take delivery of the aircraft, which won't be until 2019. The A350-1000 is a longer variant of its predecessor, the A350-900, of which Cathay Pacific already operates 22, enabling it to have a higher seat count. Overall, Cathay Pacific's A350-1000 has 334 seats (46 in business, 32 in premium economy and 256 in economy), while the A350-900 has just 280 seats (38 in business, 28 in premium economy and 214 in economy). Business class and premium economy feature largely the same seat products as those found in the current A350-900, though with some minor tweaks to the mechanisms. The key difference in business class between the -900 and the -1000 is that the latter has all seats in a single cabin as opposed to them being split across two cabins, as in the -900. However, the economy class cabin features an all-new seat product developed by Haeco - these are different to the other new 10-abreast economy class seat Cathay Pacific recently rolled out on its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. The dimensions for the seat are the same as those on the A350-900 - 32-inch pitch and 18-inch width - but have been designed with a different high-comfort cushion and also feature an adjustable ergonomic six-way headrest and a new tray table offering. Asked why Cathay Pacific opted not to equip the aircraft with a first class cabin, Cathay Pacific chief customer and commercial officer, Paul Loo, said: \"We have a first class cabin on our B777, and first class is a very niche market ... Having the right configuration to suit the needs of the market, first class consumes quite a bit of real estate on the aircraft and so we need to do the trade-off between having the cabin and having the extra costs versus having the demand or not. \"We believe our B777 fleet with first class is serving our market very well and on the other hand, our A350 fleet, whether it is the -900 or the -1000, the configuration will also help us to develop into markets that may not be available to us today.\" However, Loo did confirm the airline is currently trying out different prototypes for its next first class seat product for its upcoming Boeing 777-9X aircraft. The delivery brings Cathay Pacific's total fleet size up to 207 aircraft. The airline has a total of 20 A350-1000 in the pipeline that are expected to be delivered by 2021, along with a further six A350-900s, 21 next-generation Boeing 777-9X, as well as 32 A321neo aircraft that will go to its regional subsidiary, Cathay Dragon. The A350-1000 is due to fly to Taipei starting July 1 for crew familiarization purposes, ahead of its permanent deployment on Cathay Pacific's upcoming service to Washington DC on September 15. The flight to Dulles International Airport will be the longest in the airline's network at 7,085 nautical miles and will take approximately 17 hours.

The aircraft joins Cathay Pacific's current fleet of 22 A350-900s - it has a total of 20 A350-1000s on order, which are expected to be delivered by 2021, and a further six A350-900s still to come. The A350-1000 will debut on Cathay Pacific's upcoming Washington DC route on September 15, followed by Madrid, Tel Aviv, Amsterdam, Manchester and Zurich. Before then, however, it will fly Cathay Pacific's Taipei route for crew familiarisation purposes starting July 1, giving travellers the ability to experience the new aircraft before its formal debut in September. Business Traveller Asia-Pacific was on-board the delivery flight of Cathay Pacific's first A350-1000 from the Airbus airfield in Toulouse to Hong Kong earlier this week. What's it like? The A350-1000 is a larger aircraft than its predecessor, both in length and in capacity. The newer variant has a total of 334 seats, comprising 46 in business class, 32 in premium economy and 256 in economy. As with its predecessor, this is an aircraft designed to be quiet. While the aircraft's engines do make a noticeable high-pitched whirr during takeoff, they are largely muted once the aircraft gets sufficient altitude. This is further helped in business class by the longer length of the A350-1000 compared to its predecessor, which pushes the wings further down the aircraft and away from the premium cabin. Cathay Pacific has also been outfitting its entire wide-body fleet with wifi - it currently offers it on all A350-900s and progressively on retrofitted B777s - and the A350-1000 is no exception.

The order was announced yesterday at the Farnborough Airshow currently taking place in the UK. As previously reported by Business Traveller, Starlux had been nearing a decision on a widebody aircraft to join its fleet back in May, though at the time it was considering ordering just 14 aircraft. An exact delivery date for the new A350s hasn't been announced, though the airline has previously stated it was looking to take delivery of its widebody aircraft towards the end of 2021 in time for the 2022 launch of its long-haul operations. Starlux won't begin by flying long haul, however. The airline already has an order for 10 leased A321neo narrowbody aircraft that it plans to finalise by the end of the year. Delivery of the first A321neo is expected to take place in October 2019 ahead of the airline's launch of regional operations in early 2020. Starlux has yet to unveil details of how it will configure its aircraft, though it describes itself as a full-service airline offering \"best-in-class luxury travel\". Ultimately, the startup carrier aims to develop a network that includes destinations in Asia as well as long-haul services to North America. This comes at a time when Taiwan's other two major carriers, China Airlines and EVA Air, are also enhancing their operations both regionally and long- haul, including North America. Flag carrier China Airlines launched a new non-stop flight to Ontario International Airport** in San Bernardino, California earlier this year, and began flying its own A350-900 on its San Francisco route in May last year.

It is the latest in a new generation of the fuel-efficient, carbon-composite, wide-body airliners to launch in recent years. With four-engine jumbo jets like the Boeing 747 and the Airbus A380 quickly losing favor with airlines, smaller, more efficient twin-engine widebodies have taken their place as the industry's workhorse long-haul jets. In fact, Virgin Atlantic is expected to replace its 747-400s with a fleet of A350-1000s over the next few years. Thus far, the Boeing 777 is the most successful of the twin-engine wide-bodies with 1,988 sold since its debut in 1994. Launched in 2002, the Boeing 777-300ER is, by far, the most popular version of the twin-jet and accounts for about 42% of the plane's sales total. Airbus has 890 orders for the A350; 168 of which are for the Dash 1000. Until the A350-1000's arrival, Airbus didn't really have a true rival for the 777-300ER. The A330-300 had the size, but not quite the range while the quad- engine A340-600 had the range and the capacity, but was far less efficient. In fact, Qatar is actually operating the A350-1000 alongside its existing fleet of 777-300ERs. \"The A350-1000 is performing very well in our fleet,\" Qatar Airways Group CEO Akbar Al Baker said to a roundtable of reporters at the 2018 Farnborough International Airshow in July. \"Actually, it's performing better than what we envisaged.\" According to Airbus, the A350 is capable of delivering 25% better fuel efficiency and a 25% unit costs compared to previous generation aircraft like the 777. \"Yes, they are right,\" Al Baker said regarding Airbus's efficiency claims. \"And this is why Boeing has launched the 777X to compete against the fuel efficiency of the Airbus A350-1000.\" Qatar Airways also has orders in place for 60 of Boeing next-generation 777X airliners that are expected to enter service in 2020. The Doha, Qatar-based airline was also the launch customer of the smaller A350-900 back in 2014. At the Farnborough Air Show, Airbus brought along an A350-1000 prototype for flight demonstrations while Qatar Airways showed off one of its Dash 1000s for guests and journalists.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/airbus-a350-1000-airliner-tour-qatar-airways-2018-8"}, {"title": "Qatar Airways upgrades part of A350 order to biggest model", "date": "2018-10-01", "content": "Qatar Airways said on Monday it was upgrading five of its Airbus AIR.PA A350 jets on order to the largest model, in a boost for the European planemaker's largest twin- engined jet. The Gulf airline was the launch customer for both A350 models and said in February it could switch some of its existing order of A350-900s to the bigger A350-1000. \"Since taking delivery of the world's first A350-1000 in February 2018, we have been extremely pleased with the aircraft's performance, which has prompted us to update our original order,\" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said in a statement. State-owned Qatar Airways has upgraded the order amid a political dispute in the Arab region that has forced the airline to increase operational costs by flying longer routes. Qatar Airways has been banned from the airspace of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain since June 2017 as a result of those countries cutting ties with Qatar. The upgraded order will come as a relief to Airbus, which is betting on the A350-1000 to contain any market pressure from rival Boeing BA.N which is developing its new model 777 twin-engined jet. The A350-1000 is designed to seat 366 people and competes head-to-head with Boeing's profitable 777. Airbus says the lightweight A350-1000 is 25 percent more efficient than the most popular current version of the 777, the 777-300ER. Qatar Airways is the top A350 customer with 76 on order, which now includes 42 A350-1000s with a list price of $367 million. Airbus said that in Qatar Airways' configuration, the A350-1000 features 44 more seats than the A350-900.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qatar-airways-airbus-a350-idUSKCN1MB25E"}, {"title": "Qatar To Take On 5 More A350-1000's", "date": "2018-10-02", "content": "Qatar Airways has announced that it is altering its Airbus A350 orders. The flag carrier airline is converting five of its A350-900 orders into orders for A350-1000 aircraft. The airline, which was the launch customer for both variants of the A350, had previously hinted that it may make such a move in response to the changing market conditions. \"Latest in Aerodynamics\": The A350 family is Airbus' answer to the B787. Despite deliveries starting off slowly, it looks as though the airliner is becoming a firm favourite for long- haul flights. The A350-900ULR is this month going to start operating the world's longest flight from Singapore to New York. The flight will be commencing on October 11th. In fact, the CEO of Qantas has previously indicated that the A350 could be a contender for its ambitious plan to launch direct flights between London and Sydney as part of Project Sunrise. Extremely Pleased With Performance: Announcing the change in orders His Excellency Mr Akbar Al Baker, CEO of Qatar Airways, mentioned that the move was down to the performance of the A350. With a new total of 42 A350-1000 aircraft on order, the total number of A350-1000 aircraft in Airbus' order books has risen to 173. Commenting on the change in orders, Mr Al Baker told press: \"Since taking delivery of the world's first A350-1000 in February 2018, we have been extremely pleased with the aircraft's performance, which has prompted us to update our original order. The A350-1000 has been a welcome addition to our fleet and very well received by our passengers who enjoy the new generation aircraft's unprecedented levels of comfort and technology.\" B777x Competitor: Airbus is hoping that the A350-1000 will deter customers from ordering the new B777x aircraft which Boeing is about to begin testing. The A350-1000 seats 366 passengers and is 25% more efficient than the current B777 models on the market. The new B777x utilises technology which makes the B787 so efficient, so the difference between the B777x and A350-1000 may not be that large. ### Unique Business Class The new A350-1000 aircraft is certainly a boon for Qatar Airways. They are plenty spacious, allowing the Middle Eastern airline to install an all-new business class experience on the aircraft. Specifically, the new seats will make Qatar the first airline to offer double beds in business class.

After initially announcing late October 2019 as the start date for its A350-1000 flights to Sydney and Canberra, Qatar pushed the date back to mid-November. Now, the date for the first flight has shifted again with the first Sydney bound A350-1000 pushing back from the gate at Doha on November 1, 2019. This was reported in Executive Traveller and a check of the Qatar Airways website has the A350-1000 listed to operate QR906 down to Sydney and onto Canberra on November 1. Qatar Airways has extensive operations into Australia, including A350-900 services to Adelaide, but this is the first time they've brought the A350-1000 down. In fact, they will be only the second operator of the A350-1000 into Australia. The Doha based airline operates two daily services into Sydney. Their evening departure from Doha is operated by an A380 and their morning Doha departure is currently operated by a 777-330ER. Flying east, through the timezones, these flights touch down almost one full day after departure although the flying time is only fourteen and a half hours. It is the 777-300ER service that Qatar Airways is swapping out for the A350-1000. As David Flynn in Executive Traveller notes, the 777-300ER is fine but the A350-1000 is a step up in class. It is quieter, bigger, and more modern. Qatar Airways chaffs against traffic restrictions. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of this service is its tag flight between Sydney and Canberra. The main service, QF906 between Doha and Sydney continues down to Canberra. Qatar Airways is one of only two international airlines that fly into Canberra. The aircraft sits on the ground in Canberra for a couple of hours before heading back to Sydney, picking up more passengers and heading out in the evening northwest to Doha. The Canberra tag flight, whilst no doubt much welcomed by Canberrans who can avoid the whole domestic - international transfer fiasco at Sydney Airport, is a creative workaround of a treaty between Australia and Qatar which only allow 21 direct flights a week into the big Australian airports. You've got the daily service in Perth, Melbourne, and Sydney and that allowance is chewed up. But access to Australia's secondary airports is not so restricted. So by adding that Canberra tag flight on, Qatar Airways picks up a second daily service to Sydney. A nice workaround and a win for Canberra locals. And, they are now picking up an A350-1000 into the deal. Would a tag flight out of Melbourne work? Would a Qatar tag flight to Hobart out of Melbourne be out of the question? Tasmania's capital city airport would love an international service. Qatar's Melbourne service does well. It's an A380 service. Maybe a future possibility is two daily flights using smaller aircraft, sending one down to Hobart as a tag flight. While that's an interesting scenario, back on the ground, the A350-1000 service to Sydney and Canberra will be able to accommodate 327 passengers in two cabin classes. The majority of the economy cabin is configured in a 3-3-3 layout. Up the front, in business, 46 passengers can kick back in their Q Suites. Doing the full flight, all the way to Canberra would take 17 hours. I could think of worse ways to spend 17 hours.

The clip then finishes off by showing a crew member preparing a tasty-looking onboard meal. Plenty to offer: When Qatar announced the arrival of the plane, CEO Akbar Al Baker shared that the arrival helps his airline maintain its status as flying one of the youngest fleets in the sky. He added that it offers passengers outstanding levels of comfort, which Qatar prides itself on giving. Furthermore, since the plane is 23 feet longer than the A350-900, it helps the firm substantially increase its capacity on the routes it operates on. The plane holds 46 seats in the Qsuite and 281 extra-wide 18-inch seats in economy class. Altogether, there are 44 extra seats in this aircraft compared with the smaller type. There are 22-inch HD flight entertainment screens placed at the front of each Qsuite seat. If these passengers rather catch some sleep, they can rest on their fully flat beds. In economy class, each seat features an 11.6-inch screen. There is also extra space at shoulder level for travelers in window seats. The comforting atmosphere is polished off with soft LED mood lighting. Qatar is expecting to operate 42 -1000 aircraft. According to Planespotters, the firm currently holds 14 of the planes within its fleet. These are supported by 49 -900s, giving it a total of 53 A350 XWBs. The video tour shows some variations between the two aircraft. One of the key differences is that the classy bar area, which is situated between two cabins of the -900 is omitted on the -1000. However, this has made way for the spacious Qsuite cabins. Perfect for long distances: Qatar flies the jet on several of its long haul routes across the globe. Operations to Dallas and Houston started last summer. Additionally, it recently added the aircraft on flights to Australia via the Doha-Sydney-Canberra route. Those that are set to be on a flight served with this model will be in for a comfortable experience, no matter which cabin they are in.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/qatar-airways-airbus-a350-1000-a-video-tour/"}, {"title": "Airbus To Test Fly A350's In Bird-Like Flocks To Reduce Emissions", "date": "2020-02-18", "content": "Inspired by flocks of geese, Airbus is planning to undertake real-life testing of an operational strategy it is calling 'fello'fly'. An A350-1000 test aircraft is going to fly within 1.5nmi of a commercial A350-900, to test out Airbus' theory that flying in formation could reduce fuel consumption. While it's an interesting theory, it's also rather dangerous due to the potential for wake turbulence. Will flying in this way ever really happen? Airbus to test benefits of formation flying: The way Airbus describes this flight strategy is 'surfing the vortex'. It says that the following aircraft could be positioned in such a way so as to capture the energy generated by the wake vortex, and to use it to offset its own energy needs. Airbus estimates that this could lead to a significant fuel saving. Specifically, Airbus has said that automated formation flight operations would take place in cruise only. It is planning to use its own A350-1000 testbed to follow behind a customer A350-900 in flight, in order to test out the theory. The test aircraft will be flying just 1.5nmi behind the other. What about the hazards? When we previously introduced the idea of formation flying, Simple Flying readers raised some interesting issues which would need to be addressed in order for this idea to really take off. The biggest issue to overcome is wake turbulence. The disruption of air by the leading aircraft would buffet the following aircraft, making the journey very uncomfortable for passengers on board. Right now, FAA regulations specify a five mile separation to avoid wake turbulence. When Airbus raised this idea at the 40th Assembly of the ICAO, it said, \"Whilst wake turbulence is commonly considered as a threat for commercial airplanes, this concept aims at taking benefit from the energy contained in trailing vortices, without compromising safety which is paramount. Thus, positioning a trailing aircraft in a right way in the area where the vortex pushes air upward enables the trailing aircraft to save over 10% fuel.\" It's an interesting concept, but one that will have to be seen to be believed. And it's not going to be seen on commercial flights any time soon, because it is simply not allowed. The Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System will raise alerts if the mandatory degree of separation is breached, and would require firstly the rules to be amended and secondly the system to be recalibrated in order stop the TCAS alert. Added to this, not every flight crew will be able to get involved in formation flying. While military pilots will have had some experience of close flight paths, commercial pilots will never have flown this close together. Extensive additional crew training will clearly be needed, putting another barrier in place to any sort of timely adoption of this operational modification. Fundamentally, formation flying sounds as dangerous as it does beneficial. There are reasons for the separation protocols that are followed in modern commercial aviation, and these reasons aren't going away just because Airbus wants them to. Will it ever happen? While Airbus may get a few test flights under their belt by the end of the year, a widespread rollout of formation flying is a long way off, if it ever happens at all. Flying close to another airliner drastically increases the risk of flight, and is not likely to have a huge queue of airlines willing to take it up, even c onsidering the fuel saving. Added to this are extensive regulatory hurdles to overcome. Bodies like EASA and the FAA will not be railroaded into changing regulations that have been in place for decades, particularly when it comes to safety. Airbus pressed the ICAO to develop International Standards and Recommended Practices to help them press forward with the study of formation flight, although it admitted that \"the work in automated formation flight operations could experience significant delays.\" It will be interesting to see what Airbus' results of this forthcoming test are, and particularly whether it can overcome the wake turbulence issue. However, it is highly unlikely any commercial flights will be traveling anywhere near any other aircraft for a very long time.

Both the A350 order and Project Sunrise were subsequently put on hold less than five months later as Qantas began to right-size its fleet, and its capital expenditure, against an uncertain future. \"We do think there's still a good business case for it, and a good opportunity,\" Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce told Executive Traveller. \"We think there is a huge potential for Project Sunrise, but the time is not right now, given the impact that COVID-19 has had on world travel.\" \"We certainly won't be ordering aircraft for that this year, and we'll keep a review on when is the appropriate time, when has the market recovered, when is Qantas in a position to commit to more aircraft and more capital.\" Here's a rundown of Qantas' plans for the Airbus A350 and how it still might take off, if a few years later than first planned. Qantas' Airbus A350 order: Both the Airbus A350 and the Boeing 777X were candidates for non-stop Project Sunrise routes from Sydney, Melbourne and potentially Brisbane to London, New York, Paris and a handful of other cities including Frankfurt, Capetown and Rio de Janeiro. The specific models under consideration for those 18-20 hour flights were the Airbus A350-1000 and the Boeing 777-8 Although Singapore Airlines flies the Airbus A350-900 non-stop to New York and Los Angeles in a special ultra-long rage version known as the A350-900ULR, that jet is fitted out with only business class and premium economy. Qantas opted for the larger A350-1000 model with plans to have all four classes - first, business, premium economy and economy - while Airbus extended the aircraft's range by adding an extra fuel tank. Joyce praised the A350-1000 as being \"a fantastic aircraft and the deal on the table with Airbus gives us the best possible combination of commercial terms, fuel efficiency, operating cost and customer experience. The aircraft and engine combination is next generation technology but it's thoroughly proven after more than two years in service.\" Qantas' Airbus A350 fleet: Qantas' initial Airbus A350 order was for \"up to 12\" Airbus A350-1000s, which were to have been delivered from early 2023, with the inaugural Project Sunrise flights to London and New York launching by mid-2023. However, further A350-1000 orders were tipped to follow as eventual replacements for Qantas' 12 Airbus A380s, which at the time where expected to be retired from the late 2020s - although some of the superjumbos may now be put out to pasture ahead of time due to a predicted post-coronavirus slump in air travel. \"The Qantas of 2021 and 2022 will not be the Qantas of 2019,\" Joyce said in announcing a review of the airline's entire international fleet. \"There is a potential to bring all 12 back, but there is a potential to bring less than 12 back,\" Joyce says of the airline's flagship jets. \"That will depend on what the recovery scenario looks like.\" Although Qantas never shared its Airbus A350 seat map, Executive Traveller understands that the jets were to have around 270-280 seats. Prior to halting the A350 order Qantas confirmed it had completed the design of the A350's cabin configuration, with the aim of \"redefining\" all four travel classes from tip to tail. Qantas' Airbus A350 first class: Joyce described the Qantas Airbus A350-1000's top-shelf offering as being a \"super first class\" suite to cocoon high-end high flyers on the marathon Project Sunrise journeys. \"Given the nature of the routes there is definitely a market for first class,\" he told Executive Traveller. \"We think it's going to be a super first class, something that is a lot better than any product we've ever put in the air.\" There was speculation that the A350 first class suites may include sliding privacy doors - a flourish already adopted by many airlines for not only first class but in some leading-edge business class cabins. When Executive Traveller put that to Joyce, he smiled a coy smile and teased \"I want to save that for another announcement some day.\" The Qantas Airbus A350s were tipped to have a relatively small first class cabin of between four and eight suites, in line with a global trend towards reducing the number of first class suites - often driven by softer demand as business class continues to get better - while also allowing a larger physical footprint for each suite. Qantas' Airbus A350 business class: The Qantas Airbus A350s were also expected to introduce a new business class seat compared to the well-regarded Qantas Business Suite of today's Qantas Boeing 787s, Airbus A330s and, as part of a refit program, the Airbus A380 superjumbos. Qantas had been consulting with seat-makers on their very latest models, including yet-to-be-released concepts, as candidates for when the first Project Sunrise flights take wing. The bar was already set high by the superb Qsuites of fellow Oneworld member Qatar Airways, and as more and more airlines launch their latest business class with privacy doors, Qantas may feel competitive pressure to add doors to the Airbus A350 business suite. Qantas' Airbus A350 premium economy, economy class: Again with the bum-numbingly long Project Sunrise flights in mind, Qantas was believed to have spec'd out spacious designs for premium economy and economy class. The former was to said to approach 42 inches of pitch, compared to 38\" on the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787, giving passengers ample room to stretch out their legs and even cross their knees. The economy class seats were also said to offer more legroom with about 34\" of pitch, compared to 31-32\" on the Qantas Airbus A380s and Boeing 787s, and at 18\" across would slightly wider as well.", "url": "https://www.executivetraveller.com/news/qantas-a350"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "British Airways Celerbrates One Year Of Airbus A350 Operations", "date": "2020-08-05", "content": "British Airways today celebrates one year of Airbus A350-1000 operations. The airline operated its inaugural flight with the type to Madrid on August 5th, 2019. Since then, the airline has gone on to take delivery of five more of its A350 order. Last year was a year of celebration for British Airways. The British flag carrier celebrated its 100th birthday, alongside the delivery of its first Airbus A350 aircraft. This jet was unique for two reasons. Firstly, it was, of course, a new type for the airline in its 100th year. However, it also welcomed the airline's business product overhaul. The inaugural flight: Simple Flying was fortunate enough to be onboard British Airways' first Airbus A350 flight one year ago. The trip, while only a short hop from London to Madrid, was the first chance for the world to experience the airline's latest Club Suite offering. British Airways marked the occasion with a special event, starting with a speech from Alex Cruz, the airline's CEO. Here, we learned that the British flag carrier is potentially eyeing an upgrade to its First cabin onboard its future Boeing 777X aircraft. Given the two year delay to the program, it is unclear when the airline will take its first of these aircraft. The A350's layout: As mentioned, the Airbus A350 was the launch aircraft for British Airways' new business class product. The plane lacks the First cabin, however, given that the Club Suite is installed, not much is missing. The front portion of the aircraft is dedicated to the Club Suite cabin. 14 rows of 1-2-1 contain 56 fully private suites. Taking up most of the space above the wings is the premium economy or World Traveller Plus cabin. This sees 58 seats laid out across seven rows in a cozy 2-4-2 layout. Finally, occupying the rear of the aircraft is the economy cabin. This sees 219 seats laid out in a 3-3-3 configuration over 26 rows. One-third of the fleet delivered: So far, British Airways has taken delivery of six A350 aircraft, registered from G-XWBA to G-XWBF. According to AIB Family, two further planes have completed fuselage construction in Toulouse. G-XWBG yesterday completed an engine and taxi check before its first flight. Meanwhile, in mid-July, G-XWBH was spotted at the French manufacturer's home, still painted in primer. The Airbus A350 has more pronounced raked wingtips.

Rolls already had a formal exclusive agreement to provide Trent XWB-family engines on the larger A350-1000 wide-body jet, and held what industry sources have described as \"de facto\" exclusivity on the stronger-selling A350-900 until 2025. Thursday's deal - disclosed as Rolls plunged to a record 4 billion pound 2020 loss - throws backing to the troubled engine maker and counters speculation that GE could enter the programme any time soon. \"We're already exclusive on the A350-1000, and extending our position on the -900 variant, that accounts for the bulk of the A350 fleet, out to 2030 is in line with the development timeline for our next generation UltraFan engine programme,\" Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Warren East told reporters. The decision effectively postpones any re-engining of the A350 to next decade while giving Rolls more clarity as it tackles the costly UltraFan development, industry sources said. It follows reports before the coronavirus crisis that Airbus was considering upgrading its long-range A350 with new engines, opening competition between Rolls and GE as it sought to reduce exposure to financial difficulties at Rolls. Such a shake-up would redraw alliances in the aircraft industry but risked becoming tangled in conflicting engine deals, since the A350 addresses different parts of the jet market. Airbus had no immediate comment on engine decisions. The A350-1000 competes with the exclusively GE-powered Boeing 777 family in the market for twinjet mini-jumbos carrying about 350 people. It faces future competition from the delayed 400-seat Boeing 777X, also powered by GE. The A350-900 competes with some 777s but mainly with the smaller 787 Dreamliner, which offers both Rolls and GE engines. Analysts say arranging for GE to power the A350-1000 could run into hurdles because of the U.S. engine maker's exclusive relationship with Boeing on the competing 777. Rolls in turn is seen as reluctant to develop a future replacement engine for the A350-1000 without also having unambiguous ownership of the busier A350-900 market. With a slump in demand for wide-body jets pushing out a decision on any new investments, and GE unlikely to join the A350 programme any time soon, industry sources said Thursday's announcement lifted uncertainty over engine decisions for now.

The airline has grounded 16 of its 53 Airbus A350 aircraft on the instructions of the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority until a permanent fix has been made possible by Airbus. Qatar Airways was the launch customer of both the Airbus A350-900 and the Airbus A350-1000. However, Qatar Airways has been in a spat with Airbus for most of 2021, with no sign of the situation cooling down in the immediate future. What's the latest? The Qatar Airways Airbus A350 situation has now been slowly heating up since January. It came to a head two months ago when the airline took the drastic step of grounding aircraft \"to ensure the continued safety of all passengers\". However, beyond revealing that the decision was related to cracks found in the A350's fuselage, both Qatar and Airbus have remained relatively tight-lipped on the situation. Today, while speaking to Bloomberg at the IATA AGM in Boston, Al Baker added a little more color to the situation. He told the publication that the issue was related to the paint that the aircraft had been delivered in. It was deteriorating on composite areas where the aircraft experienced aerodynamic stress, leading to cracks in the composite structure. What is Airbus' take on the situation? Interestingly, Bloomberg also spoke to Guillaume Faury, the CEO of Airbus, at the same event. He reportedly suggested that there is no reason for any aircraft to be grounded, adding that the manufacturer is trying to resolve the issue with Qatar Airways. On the topic, an Airbus spokesperson previously told Simple Flying. Which regulators are taking action? The Qatar Civil Aviation Authority was the party that decided the 16 Airbus A350s affected by the issue needed to be grounded. They were the ones who issued the instructions to that effect. However, at the time, EASA didn't see a need to act on the issue. It seems that this remains the case. Bloomberg reports that EASA has been out to Qatar to inspect the affected aircraft. The regulator reportedly acknowledged the paint degradation but couldn't identify any issues that would affect the airworthiness of the aircraft in question. Which aircraft are affected? When Qatar Airways decided to ground these Airbus A350 aircraft two months ago, 13 jets were affected. Since then, the number of grounded A350s has increased to 16, according to data from ch-aviation.com. Both the -900 and -1000 are affected by the issue. Photo: Airbus The oldest aircraft involved is one of the first Airbus A350s to be delivered. With the serial number 006, A7-ALA is now around seven years old.

Today, Reuters is reporting that Airbus has canceled an order for two A350-1000s, as was revealed in the manufacturer's new orders and delivery data, released today. The orders and deliveries statement from Airbus showed that January 2022 has seen 30 deliveries to 20 customers. It has also secured 36 new orders. However, the interesting data is contained within the planemaker's detailed customer tables. Here, it states that Qatar Airways has just 40 A350-1000 outstanding. This is down from the original 42 that were ordered, indicating that Airbus has canceled its commitment with the airline for two airframes. 19 have already been delivered to Qatar, leaving a backlog of 21. The news comes just days after it was revealed that Airbus would cancel Qatar Airways' A321neo order in retaliation for its handling of the dispute. The latest cancelation leaves the planemaker with very little left to deliver to Qatar. In fact, the only aircraft left open on the order book are its 21 remaining A350-1000s, and it remains to be seen if all those aircraft stay on the books. What's the dispute about? In case you've been living under a rock for the past year or so, Qatar Airways is unhappy with the condition of the paint on its delivered A350s from Airbus. The ruckus started back in early 2021, when it was revealed that Qatar was 'unhappy' with Airbus. At the time, the CEO stated it was nothing to do with paint, but nevertheless stopped taking delivery of any new A350s until the problem was resolved. However, by the start of the autumn, it was clear that this was indeed a paint issue. Up to that point, it had only been noted that there was some sort of 'cracking' issue, but Qatar was now ready to shine a light on the problem. Shortly after coming clean, it became apparent that it was not only Qatar who had noted some issues with the paint finish. Most recently, Qatar has sought legal assessment in its complaints over the paintwork. Indeed, the UK's investment minister even offered to mediate, but the airline has pressed on and has issued legal proceedings against Airbus at London's High Court. The airline took the bold step of going public with the problem earlier this month. It released a damning video of at least three of its A350s, detailing the problems it is dealing with. Airbus responded by canceling its 50-plane A321neo order entirely. Lost customer: Since the row with Airbus came to a head, Qatar has been courting its rival Boeing. Indeed, it placed a huge order for the 777X freighter and the 737 MAX during the Emir's visit to the United States. For Airbus, it looks like this is the end of a longstanding friendship.

With the A350-1000 upsizing, Ethiopian Airlines' backlog now consists of four A350-1000s and two A350-900s. \"We are delighted over the upsizing of the A350-900 on order to the largest variant, A350-1000, that helps us stay ahead of the curve in technology,\" said Mesfin Tasew, Ethiopian Airlines Group CEO. \"The A350-1000 is the best fit for our dense routes, and we believe that the upsizing will be instrumental in satisfying the increasing demand of customers in our vast global network across five continents. We will continue on keeping ourselves abreast of aviation technology advancements to enhance our service and fulfil customers' demand.\" The Airbus A350's clean-sheet design features the latest aerodynamics, a carbon fibre fuselage and wings, plus the most fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, that together deliver a 25% reduction in fuel-burn and CO2 emissions compared to previous generation twin-aisle aircraft. \"We are proud of our strong partnership with Ethiopian Airlines - the first airline in Africa to order and operate the A350-900. In another first, Ethiopian Airlines is once again leading the way in Africa's aviation sector by introducing the A350-1000, the largest version of the world's most efficient and technologically advanced passenger aircraft,\" said Mikail Houari, President, Airbus Africa and Middle East. \"The A350-900 has delivered extraordinary capability, fuel efficiency, and operational reliability of 99.5 percent together with unbeatable operational flexibility and efficiency, from short to ultra-long-range operations.\" By the end of June 2022, the A350 Family had received 940 orders from 52 customers.", "url": "https://www.travelnewsasia.com/news22/38-EthiopianAirlines.shtml"}, {"title": "Not For Triskaidekaphobics: British Airways Takes Delivery Of 13th Airbus A350-1000", "date": "2022-08-28", "content": "On August 27th, an Airbus A350-1000 was delivered to British Airways, flying from Toulouse to London Heathrow. If you suffer from triskaidekaphobia, or just consider it an unlucky number - then you may want to avoid British Airways' latest Airbus A350-1000. Interestingly, the UK flag carrier also includes a row 13 even though rival Virgin Atlantic and many other airlines avoid it. But before we digress too far, most other aviation enthusiasts should be excited about British Airways taking delivery of yet another widebody. This took place on August 27th. Weekend delivery: On Saturday, August 27th, British Airways took delivery of its 13th Airbus A350-1000. Registered G-XWBM, the aircraft has MSN 563, which puts it just after an Air France A350-900 and just before a Singapore Airlines A350-900. Interestingly, both of these aircraft were delivered to their respective customers in late June. As for MSN 563, the aircraft took off from Toulouse this past Saturday at 13:16 local time. With a one-hour time difference, the aircraft landed at 13:44 local, having a flight time of one hour and 28 minutes. More about G-XWBM: According to AIB Family Flights data, British Airways' latest A350 conducted a total of four test flights, accumulating near eight hours of flight test hours. The aircraft was first spotted on July 4th conducting an engine run and taxi check, and had its first flight on July 22nd. Complete with a 13th row, this aircraft will be configured with three classes, identical to its fellow A350s. This setup sees 56 seats in business class, 56 in premium economy, and 219 seats in economy class. Data from ch-aviation.com indicates that the jet is company-owned. This is not the case for many other A350s operated by British Airways, which have been financed through various aircraft leasing firms. Other British Airways jets yet to be delivered: With BA having ordered a total of 18 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft, the airline now has just five of the type outstanding from its original 2013 order. However, the A350 is not the only new aircraft type expected by the airline. British Airways is also expecting 10 more Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners - a process which has been paused over the past two years. Indeed, the most 'recent' 787-10 to arrive at the airline was delivered on June 30th, 2020. This extended pause in deliveries was initially due to the pandemic but later on due to Boeing and FAA scrutiny. ch-aviation.com data indicates that five undelivered British Airways 787-10s already have manufacturer serial numbers and assigned UK registration numbers. These are: G-ZBLC, ZBLD, ZBLE, ZBLF, and ZBLG. With Boeing once again clear to deliver Dreamliners to customers, it hopefully won't be too long before BA gets a few more 787s. However, it should be noted that this extended pause has resulted in over 100 787s parked - a backlog that will take some time to clear. As for recent activity, BOE Family Flights indicates that G-ZBLF conducted its 11th and 12th test flights on August 16th and 24th, respectively. This jet has now accumulated over 19 hours of test flight time across 12 flights.

After developing this story in 2019 and confirming it last year, Runway Girl Network spoke in depth with Airbus' vice president of cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer and head of aircraft interiors marketing Ana\u00efs Marzo, diving into substantial detail about the plans. At the airframe level, the NPS A350s bring a significant weight reduction of up to 1.2t, a 3t maximum takeoff weight increase, and enhanced performance. In the cabin, they offer an extra 35\" of cabin length from moving the rear bulkhead and adjusting the arrangement of the flight deck, forward crew rest and forward monuments - and, most controversially, expect to add up to thirty extra seats gained from a four-inch wider cabin, secured by changing the way the airframe itself is constructed and connected. The NPS' weight reduction comes, Ana\u00efs Marzo says, \"because we've been optimising structures and systems: for example, brackets, electrical systems, and wiring, and also increasing the use of advanced materials. This means basically more carbon fibre use, mainly in the fuselage, as well as the wings.\" In terms of performance, Marzo emphasises, \"there is no physical change to the aeroplane. In fact, there is a software change in order to improve the way in which you can control flaps during takeoff, and increasing the number of positions, in order to improve performance at challenging airports or in difficult conditions.\" A system enabling faster landing gear retraction also increases performance, and overall the maximum takeoff weight increases from 280-283t on the A350-900 and 316-319t on the A350-1000. Within the cabin, it's a question of width and length: In terms of cabin width, Airbus is changing the very frames of the NPS aircraft, and how they connect together, to enable the interior of the cabin to fit two inches more closely to the inside of the aircraft's fuselage on either side. Marzo refers to this as \"frame sculpting\". This allows a total of four inches more cabin width at armrest level, with an Airbus diagram showing additional space of approximately two inches per side from armrest to roughly mid-thigh, and a smaller amount of additional space between the tops of the windows and the overhead bins. This will allow Airbus, Marzo and Wuggetzer say, to offer 17\"-wide seats with a 1.5\" armrest width and 17\" aisle - up from 16.7\" per seat with a 1.8\" armrest on the aisle, 1.5\" armrests elsewhere, and a 15.67\" aisle. The mathematics, an Airbus table seen by RGN says, bring a cabin of 223.5 inches for the NPS ten-abreast compared with 219.4 for the previous generation. Longtime readers of RGN will remember Ingo Wuggetzer standing in Airbus briefing rooms citing ten-abreast A350 seats as 16.4\" wide in the last decade or so, so the proof will be in the physical pudding of these seats - and of course in which airlines, and which kind of airlines, decide that this very tight 17\" seat with the tiny armrests is acceptable for their economy class brand. It seems that even full-service carriers are going in this direction, even possibly Etihad, rather than just what Airbus executives as recently as 2019 were referring to as a standard below mainstream economy on low-cost and leisure carriers like French bee and Air Cara\u00efbes. There remain, of course, some airlines that took a stand on ten-abreast 777s, some five inches wider than the new A350 even in their current-generation pre-777X version, which itself will have newly sculpted sidewalls. For these airlines, which will retain nine-abreast in the new production standard, Airbus is citing 18.7\"-wide seats with a 17\" aisle and 1.8\" armrests as one example of how airlines could choose to pass around the extra four inches between passengers. In premium economy, where the A350's current eight-abreast layout is the least generous in the sky, this now enables an example of 19\" seats with an 18\" aisle, a 5\" centre console and a 1.8\" single armrest width. In business class, Airbus is already working with seatmakers to optimise the use of the additional 4\". Extra space in front and rear galleys is great news: Beyond the seats, cabin crew - and therefore passengers - will be relieved to find additional space in the forward and rear galleys, enabling smoother service and more innovation in this area, where the A350 has come in for some criticism. Behind doors 4, Airbus has pushed the rear pressure bulkhead of the aircraft backwards by one full frame, bringing 24\" of extra space into play behind the doors. In this space, Airbus is now offering either a large new \"V-Shape XL Galley\" or the \"ICE Increased Cabin Efficiency XL\", with the latter offering a smaller galley space but one lavatory on either side of the aircraft. Each of these adds six full trolleys of capacity, plus the workspace and galley insert space above them - a notable feat. At the front of the NPS aircraft 1, Marzo explains, Airbus has optimised the space in two ways. First, the bulkhead with the crew cabin control unit and the two flight attendant seats at door 1L has been moved a few inches closer to the door. Second, the fourth seat in the flight deck has been swapped from floor-mounting to wall-mounting, enabling the flight deck wall to be pushed forwards five inches. Ahead of 1L, there is thus either the option of a new four-trolley galley - up from three trolleys - with extra insert space, or a 50-inch premium lavatory that Airbus claims is PRM compliant. On the other side of the gangway leading to the flight deck, ahead of door 1R, the access to the crew rest has been relocated, resulting in a new greatly expanded galley that grows from 5.5 to eight trolleys, with a corresponding increase in inserts and workspace. The newly redesigned crew rest moves to the monument column immediately ahead of the front row of passengers, meaning that this aft-facing galley space drops from four trolleys to 3.5 - giving by our mathematics an overall increase in 2 trolleys. Airbus is also taking the opportunity to introduce electro-dimmable windows from Gentex, suggesting that these windows are twice as fast as previous versions, 100 times darker and block 99.99% of visible light, as well as ultraviolet light. Overall, the NPS generation of the A350s are going to make a substantial difference. Weight reduction and greater efficiency are strong positives, while more galley space is a very welcome addition. The big question remains just how comfortable or otherwise the ultra-narrow seats and armrests will be, and the extent to which full-service airlines choose what will be the smallest economy class product in the sky. Airbus suggests that seatmakers have done substantial work on this, but adding extra seats to comfortable Airbus widebodies has not been without risk in the past. We will withhold judgment until actually seeing the product up close.", "url": "https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/2022/09/airbus-a350-nps-variant-mtow/"}]}]
