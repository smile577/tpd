The announcement comes after an extensive and transparent dialogue between Air Force officials and officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Air Mobility Command, industry and members of Congress. Sue C. Payton, the Air Force's senior acquisition executive, said that throughout this entire acquisition process, the Air Force has sought to minimize development risk among differing aircraft manufacturers and types. This RFP is the culmination of those deliberations. \"The Air Force aerial tanker is essential to all Air Force and Joint global operations,\" said Lt. Gen. Donald Hoffman, the military deputy for acquisition. \"It allows the Joint Force to project mobility, strike and surveillance forces anywhere and anytime without relying on intermediate bases for refueling. Tankers put the 'Global' in Global Power.\" The KC-X program is the first of three acquisition programs the Air Force will need to replace the entire fleet of aging KC-135 Stratotankers, which have been in service for more than 50 years. The primary mission of the KC-X will be to provide aerial refueling to United States military and coalition aircraft in the global war on terror and other missions. However, the Air Force also intends to take full advantage of the other capabilities inherent in the platform, and make it an integral part of the Defense Transportation System. \"From addressing national security threats to supporting rapid global strikes to providing urgently needed humanitarian operations, Joint and Coalition operations depend upon the rapid global mobility capabilities which the Air Force aerial tanker provides,\" said the general. The RFP stipulates nine primary key performance parameters: 1) Air refueling capability, 2) Fuel offload and range at least as great as the KC-135, 3) Compliant Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) equipment, 4) Airlift capability, 5) Ability to take on fuel while airborne, 6) Sufficient force protection measures, 7) Ability to network into the information available in the battle space, 8) Survivability measures (defensive systems, Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP) hardening, chemical/biological protection, etc), 9) Provisioning for a multi-point refueling system to support Navy and Allied aircraft. Ms. Payton stressed that the department has gone through a rigorous review process for KC-X and has validated that the RFP accurately reflects the requirements as laid out by the warfighter. The final RFP defines an integrated, capability-based, best-value approach. The RFP includes specific factors for assessing the capability contribution of each offeror. Along with cost and assessments of past performance and proposal risk, these factors provide the source selection authority with excellent means to determine the best value between proposals of significantly differing capabilities and cost. \"The Air Force remains committed to a full and open competition. The KC-X is the Air Force's #1 acquisition priority and its acquisition will continue to be conducted in a transparent and deliberate manner,\" said Ms. Payton.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20070215184337/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123039273"}, {"title": "Boeing unveils tanker for $40 billion deal", "date": "2007-02-12", "content": "Boeing today announced a newly designed KC-767 as its proposed aircraft for a $40 billion Air Force contract competition to replace 179 refueling planes. The company said at a press conference held in Washington that it tweaked the design of its long-range 767 freighter plane to improve fuel efficiency, among other factors. Boeing says the basic tanker platform would be built in Everett, then flown to Wichita, Kan., for major military modifications. However, as is the case with the Poseidon program, Boeing would likely do some initial modifications on the Everett assembly line. If Boeing wins the tanker contract, the likely immediate job impact will be a revival of the engineering design team working on the project. Boeing is competing against Northrop Grumman Corp., which is expected to offer its KC-30, a modified Airbus A330, at a discounted price. At stake for both competitors is a multiyear contract to replace a portion of the military's older fleet of KC-135 aircraft, a medium-sized refueling plane made by Boeing. The $40 billion contract is the first installment of an expected three-phase deal that calls for more than 500 planes and could be worth an estimated $100 billion. In 2004, Boeing slowed production of the 767 to one per month as it sought to keep commercial production going long enough so the assembly line could switch without a significant break to tanker production. The 767 workforce correspondingly shrunk to a minimum. The Boeing-led team includes Smiths Aerospace, a unit of Smiths Group, Rockwell Collins, Vought Aircraft Industries, Honeywell and Spirit AeroSystems \"This KC-767 advanced tanker will support more than 44,000 American jobs and 300 suppliers,\" Mark McGraw, a vice president of Boeing's tanker division, said.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110524044220/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003568484_webtanker12.html"}, {"title": "Boeing Offers KC-767 Advanced Tanker to U.S. Air Force", "date": "2007-02-12", "content": "The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] today announced that it will offer the KC-767 Advanced Tanker for the U.S. Air Force's KC-X Tanker competition. \"The Air Force has made it clear -- the mission is refueling aircraft, often in tight, hostile locations. The Boeing KC-767 Advanced Tanker is made for this mission,\" said Ron Marcotte, vice president and general manager of Boeing Global Mobility Systems. \"It is the ideal fit for the requirements set forth in the Air Force's Request for Proposals. Highly energy efficient, agile and with exceptional takeoff performance, the KC-767 puts more fuel closer to the fight -- with access to more than 1,000 additional bases worldwide than the KC-135.\" The tanker will be an advanced derivative of the future 767-200 Long Range Freighter and will be produced at Boeing's facilities in Everett, Wash., on the existing commercial line where more than 950 highly reliable and maintainable 767s have been built. Installation of military refueling systems and flight test activities will take place at the company's finishing center in Wichita, Kan. Boeing's Global Tanker Team producing the KC-767 Advanced Tanker includes Smiths Aerospace, Rockwell Collins, Vought Aircraft Industries, Honeywell and the newest member -- Spirit AeroSystems. The team has proven expertise in aerial refueling systems, network centric operations, integrated avionics solutions and lean manufacturing concepts. \"This KC-767 Advanced Tanker will support more than 44,000 American jobs and 300 suppliers,\" said Mark McGraw, vice president, Boeing Tanker Programs. With more than $1 billion already invested in the KC-767, Boeing will blend the latest commercial and military capabilities into the world's most technologically advanced tanker. Innovations include an advanced fly-by-wire boom, new wing refueling pods, a centerline hose drum refueling unit, the most advanced 777 commercial digital flight deck and a third-generation remote vision refueling system. This is a tanker with flexibility to meet other airlift missions; whether it's delivering three times more pallets and passengers than the KC-135 or five times as many patients and medical crewmembers.

The 7,000-page KC-X proposal describes a tanker uniquely designed for its primary air refueling mission, but also capable of moving cargo, passengers, patients and medical crewmembers. Based on a new version of the 767-200 Long Range Freighter, the KC-767 Advanced Tanker's innovations include an advanced fly-by-wire boom, new wing refueling pods, a centerline hose drum refueling unit, an advanced commercial digital flight deck and a third-generation remote vision refueling system. The next-generation tanker utilizes cutting-edge technology to meet every aspect of the global mobility mission. \"The KC-767 Advanced Tanker will do for refueling what the C-17 has done for airlift -- it will revolutionize mobility operations,\" said James Albaugh, president and CEO, Boeing Integrated Defense Systems. \"Right-sized to enable access to 1,000 more bases than the KC-135, this robust aircraft allows commanders to deploy more tankers, ensures more booms are in the sky, covers more refueling orbits and offloads more fuel.\" The Boeing KC-767 Advanced Tanker will be designed, built and supported by 44,000 Americans and 300 U.S. suppliers and save taxpayers nearly $10 billion in fuel costs compared to the competitor. Boeing will produce the tanker at its facilities in Everett, Wash., on the existing commercial line where it has built more than 950 highly reliable and maintainable 767s.

Since then, the Air Force has worked with the competitors to enable them to thoroughly understand USAF tanker requirements in order to submit the most optimal solution. The final Boeing proposal for the KC-767AT is tailored to meet or exceed all of the Air Force's mission requirements. For example, using ground rules in the KC-X Request for Proposal, nearly twice as many KC-767s can be based on a parking ramp compared to the competitor's oversized aircraft. Those additional KC-767s will provide more critical fuel to receiver aircraft closer to the fight while requiring fewer bases to support tanker operations. Boeing's tanker also will carry three times more cargo and passengers than the KC-135 without sacrificing the operational flexibility delivered by a medium-sized aircraft. In contrast, the competitor's offering would be the second largest aircraft in the Air Force's inventory and provide unnecessary capacity. Technology advances on the KC-767AT include a sixth-generation, fly-by-wire boom that can offload more than 1,000 gallons of fuel per minute; a third-generation remote vision refueling system; and a state-of-the-art digital flight deck designed for the commercial 767-400ER. In addition to LCD flat panel displays and an integrated flight management system, tanker pilots will have two new systems available -- an electronic flight bag and a heads-up guidance system -- that will improve situational awareness and mission effectiveness. As the Department of Defense's largest consumer of fuel, the Air Force needs the most efficient, best value tanker for the future. Burning 24 percent less fuel than its competitor, the KC-767 will save the service and American taxpayer an estimated $14.6 billion. The KC-767 also will save approximately $4 billion if selected since it costs 22 percent less to maintain than its competitor. Boeing has been designing, building, modifying and supporting tankers for nearly 75 years, and is flying KC-767s today with more than 330 flights and nearly 1,000 hours on the tanker platform. The team producing the KC-767AT includes Honeywell, Rockwell Collins, Vought Aircraft Industries, Pratt & Whitney, Smiths Aerospace, Spirit AeroSystems and Delta TechOps.

This is at the heart of the battle between Boeing and Northrop Grumman for the US Air Force's $40 billion KC-X tanker contract, which is set to be awarded within weeks. Risk, cost and jobs are other factors the companies hope will differentiate their bids. Although the final proposals have been submitted, EADS upped the jobs stake last week by committing to assemble Airbus A330F commercial freighters in the USA if Northrop's A330-based KC-30 is selected. This could more than double the number of aircraft assembled in Mobile, Alabama to 48 a year, including 12-18 tankers. A Defense Acquisition Board review of the KC-X programme has been scheduled for 13 February, with industry expecting the winner to be announced within 10 days after that meeting. The contract is for 179 aircraft to begin replacing the USAF's 530 KC-135s Boeing argues its KC-767AT is the right size for the US Air Force's requirement for a KC-135 replacement that is \"first and foremost\" a tanker. Northrop claims the larger, KC-30 offers \"the lowest risk and most capability at comparable cost\". Northrop says the KC-30 offers more effectiveness as a tanker as well as greater cargo and passenger capability. Boeing questions whether the USAF could and would make use of that extra capability in the initial tranche of replacements for its ageing KC-135s. \"The aircraft are too valuable,\" believes retired USAF chief of staff Gen Ron Fogelman, now a consultant to Boeing. \"Secondary attributes are important, but not critical to a tanker. This fight should not be won based on secondary attributes,\" he argues. Northrop's air mobility sector vice-president Paul Meyer says the KC-30's greater fuel offload capability provides a higher \"fleet effectiveness value\" (FEV) in the refuelling role. FEV is one of the five source-selection evaluation criteria defined by the USAF. Calculated over five mission scenarios specified by the USAF and using prescribed airbases, ramp space and resources, Meyer says the FEV figure calculated by Northrop and submitted with its KC-30 bid is 1.62 (the KC-135 representing an FEV of 1). Northrop calculates an FEV of 1.35 for the rival KC-767, but Boeing has not released its number. Instead the company says the KC-767 offers greater military utility because more smaller, lighter tankers can operate from more airbases and shorter runways. Each argues the other represents the higher risk. Northrop says it bid is baselined on the KC-30B now in flight test for Australia, with the same cockpit, engines and refuelling boom. Meyer argues Boeing's bid is risky because it is based on a version of the 767 not yet built, combining the -200ER fuselage, -300F wing, gear and cargo door and floor, -400ER digital flightdeck and flaps, uprated engines and \"sixth-generation\" boom. Boeing vice-president tanker programmes Mark McGraw says the cost to certificate and produce this \"tailored\" version of the 767 is \"included in the price quoted us by Boeing Commercial Airplanes\" and therefore factored into the cost quoted for KC-X. But Boeing believes the KC-767 still offers the lowest \"most probable life-cycle cost\" - procurement and operating costs over 20 years - another of the USAF's five source-selection criteria. While Northrop believes the KC-30 has a \"comparable unit cost\" to the KC-767, Meyer acknowledges its life-cycle cost will likely be higher because the larger aircraft burns more fuel and costs more to maintain. But he believes the KC-30's greater capability will offset the higher cost when the USAF comes to assess best value. Boeing, meanwhile, sees risk in the plan by Northrop and EADS to transfer production of the KC-30 from France to the USA. Final assembly is to be performed by EADS North America in Mobile, and completed aircraft rolled across the runway to a Northrop facility for modification to military tankers. Boeing argues this is inherently inefficient compared with the KC-767 build plan and \"adds time and complexity to production\". Meyer says the plan is on track, with EADS committed to build the four development aircraft as commercial assets. The first of these is complete and waiting to be flown to Dresden for installation of the cargo door. \"We are holding off fitting the door until we have a contract so that the aircraft can still be sold to a commercial customer,\" he says. According to the plan, the three remaining development aircraft (D2-4) are scheduled to fly in May 2008 and January and May 2009. After contract award and door installation, D1 will fly to Madrid for tanker conversion. D2 and D3 will be converted at Northrop's facility in Melbourne, Florida. D4 will be the first converted in Mobile. Beginning with the first production KC-30 cargo doors will be installed in Mobile and from the second production aircraft onwards, Meyers says, final assembly will be performed in the USA. Both sides are taking pot shots at each other's past performance, another evaluation criteria. Northrop highlights delays to deliveries of KC-767s to Italy and Japan while Boeing points to slippage in delivery of boom-equipped KC-30Bs to Australia. But risk and cost aside, size is still the issue for KC-X.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20121104101403/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/size-matters-in-us-air-force-kc-x-contest-220925/"}, {"title": "Northrop/EADS Clinches U.S. Refueler Deal", "date": "2008-02-29", "content": "The Pentagon's competition worth up to $35 billion for the new KC-45 refueling tanker was Boeing's to lose, and it lost big. The selection of an Airbus design for its KC-135 replacement will freeze Boeing out of a market long considered to be a monopoly for the only U.S. wide-body manufacturer. Airbus has now soundly penetrated the world's largest defense market. The loss comes after seven years of design work on various versions of a 767-based tanker-planning that stemmed from a derailed attempt by the U.S. Air Force, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, to lease 100 refuelers from Boeing for nearly $30 billion. Boeing's team failed after a scandal-landing two former executives in jail-and relentless probing from the now likely Republican presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). This decision could force the U.S. contractor, which has enjoyed a position as the foremost supplier of tanker and transport aircraft to the Defense Dept., to rethink its business strategy. Uncertainty continues to plague the Chicago-based company's C-17 strategic airlifter production line in Long Beach, Calif. Boeing is funding the manufacture of 10 of the massive aircraft on its own. Boeing is now under more pressure to win the upcoming next-generation bomber competition for the U.S. Air Force, as well as the Navy's EP-3 intelligence aircraft replacement. Paul Meyer, vice president of Northrop Grumman Air Mobility Systems, says the team went into the down select with a 50% expectation of a win. \"We are penetrating a new market,\" he says. Another executive adds: \"I just didn't think the political system would let us do it.\" But the fight may not be over yet. Boeing has been forming a strategy to protest a loss since the competition began, though a protest decision hasn't yet been made. The company will be briefed on why it lost within two weeks. The Northrop Grumman/EADS team's $1.5-billion win Feb. 29 of the KC-X competition was announced after multiple delays; it includes the manufacture of four developmental aircraft. Five options worth $10.6 billion for the first 64 aircraft are included. The total buy of 179 tankers begins with the fifth aircraft to come off the line. It will take more than a decade to complete with buy rates between 12-18 aircraft at a cost of about $3 billion per year. KC-X is the first iteration of a three-phased approach to replace the Air Force's fleet of 530 KC-135E/Rs and 59 KC-10s. The next tranche to replace the Air Force's larger KC-10 tankers, dubbed KC-Y, is not expected until at least 2020, effectively freezing Boeing out of the tanker market for the foreseeable future. One factor attractive to the Air Force was the ability to use fewer KC-45s per mission, according to sources familiar with the evaluation. Air Force officials were focused on providing refueling services to the massive Pacific theater and cargo hauling for humanitarian missions over the Cold War scenarios focused on Europe. The decision seals the fate for the 767 production line, with Boeing's orders having shifted to the new 787. The U.S. contractor has about four years of work left for its Everett, Wash., production line without more orders.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110521055557/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news%2Faw03038p1.xml&headline=Northrop%2FEADS%20Clinches%20U.S.%20Refueler%20Deal&channel=awst"}, {"title": "GAO backs Boeing's tanker protest", "date": "2008-06-18", "content": "Boeing scored a major victory Wednesday in its battle to wrestle back a $35 billion Air Force contract from Northrop Grumman and its European partner. The Government Accountability Office upheld Boeing's protest of the refueling tanker contract and recommended the service hold a new competition. The congressional watchdog said it found \"a number of significant errors\" in the Air Force's February decision, including its failure to fairly judge the relative merits of each proposal. While the GAO decision is not binding, it puts tremendous pressure on the Air Force to reopen the contract and could pave the way for Boeing to capture part or all of the award from Northrop and Airbus parent European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. And it gives ammunition to Boeing supporters in Congress who have been seeking to block funding for the deal or force a new competition. Washington's congressional delegation held a news conference after the announcement, led by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. \"We are truly excited this afternoon,\" Murray said. \"What we have been saying for a number of weeks now that this competition has brought forth a wrong decision, has been validated by the GAO in a very, very strong way and that is good news for American workers it's good news for our national security and it's good news for our economy. And we feel very good about this decision.\" Some at the conference called the GAO decision \"vindication.\" \"The Air Force now has 60 days to reconsider and re-bid this contract,\" said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. \"I am sure that many of my colleagues here believe that there is absolutely no other choice then for the Air Force to re-bid this contract. So we are going to play a larger oversight role to make sure the Air Force actually does their job.\" The decision also is a setback for Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in waiting, who was instrumental in the Pentagon's long attempt to complete a deal on the tanker. The Air Force will determine its next steps after completing a review of the GAO ruling within 60 days. The service will select the \"best value tanker for our nation's defense, while being good stewards of the taxpayer dollar,\" said Air Force Assistant Secretary Sue C. Payton. Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force on the next steps in this \"critical procurement for our warfighters.\" Northrop said it continues to believe its plane was the best option for the military. Second big blow for Air Force: The GAO decision marks the second big blow to the Air Force this month, coming on the heels of the ouster of its two top officials over mistaken nuclear shipments. The Air Force also is trying to rebuild a tattered reputation following a 2003 procurement scandal that sent its top acquisition official to prison for conflict of interest and led to the collapse of an earlier tanker contract with Boeing. McCain played a key role in exposing that scandal. McCain sent two letters in 2006 urging the Defense Department to make sure the bidding proposals guaranteed competition between Boeing and Airbus. Months later, Airbus's parent company retained the firm of a McCain campaign adviser to lobby for the tanker deal. McCain on Wednesday called the GAO decision \"unfortunate for the taxpayers,\" saying Air Force officials \"need to go back and redo the contracting process and ... hopefully they will get it right.\" Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., lauded the GAO decision and called for a \"fair and transparent\" rebidding of the contract. With a leadership vacuum, a concerned Congress and an upcoming change in the White House, the Air Force needs to act quickly, said Jim McAleese, a defense industry consultant in Virginia. The tanker contract has sparked a fierce backlash among lawmakers from Washington, Kansas and other states that stand to gain jobs if Boeing succeeds in landing the award. Heated debate: The tanker contract also has touched off a heated debate over the military's use of foreign contractors because the Northrop tanker would be based on an Airbus plane largely built in Europe. Backed by union officials representing Boeing workers and \"Buy-American\" proponents, Boeing supporters on Capitol Hill have painted the competition as a fight between an American company and its European rival. Boeing estimates the tanker contract would support 44,000 new and existing jobs with more than 300 U.S. suppliers. The company would perform much of the work in Everett, Wash., and Wichita, Kan. Northrop said its tanker would support four new factories and 48,000 jobs with 230 U.S. suppliers, including more than 1,500 new positions in Mobile, Ala., where the tanker would be assembled. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said it is \"very disturbing\" that the Air Force \"will likely have to go back to square one on the warfighter's No. 1 priority.\" The contract for 179 aerial refueling tankers is the first of three deals worth up to $100 billion to replace the Air Force's entire tanker fleet over the next 30 years. GAO's rationale: Although the GAO denied some parts of Boeing's protest, it offered a lengthy rationale for why the contract should be re-competed. Among its conclusions was that the Air Force awarded the Northrop team improper extra credit for offering a larger plane that could carry more fuel, cargo and troops. It also found that the Air Force improperly increased the likely costs of the Boeing bid and failed to show that Northrop's tanker could refuel all necessary planes. \"What the GAO has told the Air Force is that they did not evaluate this accurately, they told them that their recommendation was that they had to go back and re-bid this contract with new proposals, so that means Boeing is back at the table and we're fighting for this contract,\" Murray said Wednesday. Boeing's backers in Congress also maintain that illegal European Union subsidies to Airbus gave Northrop/EADS an unfair advantage. Those subsidies are at the heart of U.S. Trade Representative complaint against the EU before the World Trade Organization. Congressman Dave Reichert released this statement: \"Today's GAO decision confirms what Boeing and other supporters have been saying all along, that the Air Force made errors in awarding the contract to Airbus.\" Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire said she had been confident that \"the GAO would agree with Boeing's appeal, and find that the Air Force made changes during the decision process that gave Boeing's competitor an unfair advantage.\" \"This announcement means there is another opportunity for Boeing to rebid for the contract and retain high-skill, high-wage jobs in Washington and across the country,\" she said in a prepared statement.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20081229142313/http://www.king5.com/topstories/stories/NW_061808BUB_boeing_gao_air_tanker_contract_JM.161e241b.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Pentagon Reopens Bidding on Tanker Contract", "date": "2008-07-09", "content": "The Defense Department has reopened the bidding process for a multibillion-dollar midair refueling tanker contract, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said today. The announcement comes after the Government Accountability Office last month found improper practices related to the $35 billion contract awarded in February to the Northrop-Grumman/EADS/Airbus consortium, which prompted a protest from rival bidder Boeing Company. \"Industry, Congress and the American people all must have confidence in the integrity of this acquisition process,\" Gates said at a Pentagon news conference. \"I believe the revised process will result in the best tanker for the Air Force at the best price for the American taxpayer.\" Replacing the Air Force as the \"source selection authority\" is John J. Young Jr., undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. He is tasked with appointing an advisory committee to oversee the selection of a bidder to supply the modified commercial aircraft fleet that will phase out the current KC-135 tankers, which are 47 years old, on average. The Defense Department has ordered Northrop-Grumman to stop work on its contract, and a modified request for proposal could be issued as early as this month. The tanker request will remain in \"open competition\" until a new contract is awarded, which Gates said he expects will happen before year's end. \"It is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long,\" the secretary said, referring to the tanker contract as one of the department's most \"time-critical.\" The Boeing protest filed early this year alleged more than 100 violations of proper contracting practices, eight of which were sustained by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. After reviewing the GAO's decision, Michael B. Donley, acting secretary of the Air Force, said he concluded that the Air Force's acquisition system is not \"fatally flawed.\" \"However, the GAO did sustain the protest in eight areas, and this has been sufficient to cast doubt on the Air Force's management of the overall process,\" he said. While re-bidding the contract will add months to the process, Donley said, it offers \"the most direct route to complete the competition, achieve a final decision and field the tanker that represent the best value for the warfighter and the taxpayer.\" Donley, who joined Gates at today's briefing, became the Air Force's acting secretary last month following a shakeup at the top levels of the service branch. The 67-page GAO report that cited \"significant errors\" in Air Force recruiting practices became public nine days into his tenure. Donley's predecessor, Michael W. Wynne, and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. T. Michael Moseley resigned in the wake of a report detailing the accidental shipment of four non-nuclear missile trigger components rather than the intended helicopter batteries to Taiwan in August 2006. The erroneous delivery came on the heels of another Air Force incident in which a B-52 bomber flew across the United States carrying six armed nuclear cruise missiles. \"The Air Force needs to rapidly apply the lessons learned from this experience and move forward,\" Donley said of the tanker contract, pressing the need to rebuild confidence in the Defense Department acquisition process. \"Other Air Force acquisition decisions are on the horizon. \"GAO's conclusions show that even in a large, complex procurement with considerable staff resources and oversight, work accomplished by our contracting personnel, our warfighters and our engineers is not always adequately prepared to withstand the detailed audits and the legal challenges that we can now expect,\" he said. Asked how the Defense Department will mitigate the chance of a future protest, Gates said the department will carry out the new process with transparency, open communication, clear expectations and fairness. \"My hope would be that when we reach the end of this process we will have a solution, will be able to reward a contract and get moving with the contract,\" he said. Young, who will head up the source selection committee, entertained the possibility that new proposals from industry bidders could come with a smaller price tag than their original offers. \"We'll see what the industry teams propose,\" he told reporters here. \"I think that would probably be the only silver lining in this, is the possibility that both teams decide to sharpen their pencils and offer the taxpayer and the warfighter an even better deal.\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080815051310/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=50453"}, {"title": "Pentagon Gives Boeing New Chance at Contract", "date": "2008-07-10", "content": "The Pentagon announced on Wednesday that it would reopen bidding on a $35 billion contract for midair refueling tankers, allowing Boeing to continue its effort to wrest the business from a partnership of Northrop Grumman and the European parent of its rival Airbus. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that the tanker contract, which was won by the partners Northrop and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company in February, would not be awarded until the Pentagon reviewed the rival bids again. The companies have battled fiercely to land the Air Force's largest contract, with a potential value of $100 billion. The struggle has been caught in issues of national pride, trans-Atlantic relations and even presidential politics. Mr. Gates's action was a public rebuke to the Air Force, which had selected the offering of Northrop and EADS, the parent of Airbus. Shortly after the Air Force made its selection, the Government Accountability Office, acting on a protest from Boeing, said that the Air Force's decision-making process was flawed and that the tanker contract should be reopened. In his announcement on Wednesday, Mr. Gates said that a special committee operating out of his office and headed by the Pentagon acquisitions under secretary, John J. Young Jr., would make the final contract selection, not the Air Force. \"I've concluded that the contract cannot be awarded at present,\" said Mr. Gates, citing the \"significant issues\" pointed out by the G.A.O. The contract, in its first phase alone, would provide for 179 aerial refueling tankers to replace the Air Force's aging fleet, which is being strained by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and has planes that date to the Eisenhower era. The Northrop team was offering a variation of its A330 plane, while Boeing was offering a modified 767. The tankers are used to refuel military planes while in the sky. There was no clear winner or loser between the two companies in Mr. Gates's decision. But it was another blow to the Air Force, whose ability to manage huge weapons-buying programs has been questioned. Two of its top officials were recently fired because of security breaches. \"Clearly, this is a vote of no confidence in the Air Force,\" said Loren B. Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute, a Washington research group. Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jeffries & Company, said that the announcement meant \"that both companies will have an equal opportunity to abuse each other for a while longer.\" Mr. Rubel added that until the Pentagon issued a modified request for proposals from the two companies, it would be difficult to determine which might have an edge. The Pentagon will not reopen the entire contracting process, but will focus on eight problem areas cited in the G.A.O. report, and Mr. Gates said the final decision might be made by December. But many analysts said that timetable might be overly ambitious. Even Mr. Young, the acquisitions under secretary, said on Wednesday that the decision-making schedule might slip. Both Boeing and Northrop issued news releases praising Mr. Gates's action. The House Armed Services Air and Land Forces Subcommittee is to begin hearings into the tanker contract and the G.A.O. report on Thursday. \"We welcome the decision by Defense Secretary Robert Gates not to proceed with the contract award to Northrop Grumman/EADS and to reopen the KC-X tanker competitions,\" said Boeing, referring to the designation it has given its airplane. Doug Kennett, a spokesman for Boeing, also said that his company was open to substituting a 777 for its 767 offering, depending on what the new bidding proposal would require. On the other side, Northrop said that it applauded Mr. Gates's decision and added that \"the United States Air Force has already picked the best tanker, and we are confident that it will do so again.\" Ralph D. Crosby Jr., chief executive of EADS North America, said the company welcomed the rebidding and said it was \"ready and anxious to get back to work\" on the project. One of the central players in the tanker contract is Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Several years ago, Mr. McCain stopped the contract from being granted to Boeing, after the terms of a tanker lease arrangement between the Air Force and Boeing were revealed. Some have seen him as favoring a European company over an American one, an impression was not eased by the fact that several of his top campaign advisers had worked as lobbyists for Airbus. In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. McCain praised Mr. Gates's decision as a step toward \"full and open competition.\" European military suppliers have long thought that the Pentagon has encouraged other nations to buy American military goods, while closing the door to purchases of military equipment made by European suppliers. And European countries thought the Airbus proposal finally gave them a shot at landing a major Pentagon contract, especially after both the British and Australian air forces picked the Airbus tanker. In London, Alexandra Ashbourne, who heads Ashbourne Strategic Consulting, an aerospace analysis firm, said Mr. Gates's decision \"was probably the best of all possible outcomes,\" but added that EADS felt \"very raw\" over the whole process, given the amount of effort and expense that went in to putting in a bid, only to see it slip away. Ms. Ashbourne added that one of the big concerns among Europeans was that the tanker contract would get caught up in the presidential race. \"On this side of the Atlantic,\" she said, \"there is concern that politics will be allowed to take hold and that Congress will get involved. Then you have pork barrel politics and it is an election year. The timing is very bad.\" In Congress, \"Buy America\" sentiment fueled outrage at the initial selection of Airbus. But that was also tempered by a fierce political battle on behalf of the European supplier by the delegations of the States of Alabama and Mississippi, where EADS promised to build most of the tankers and create jobs. Members of Congress on both sides of the issue released statements on Wednesday praising Mr. Gates, but promoting their own positions. Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who is an outspoken advocate for Boeing, said that he wanted to make sure the \"mistakes made in the original competition are not repeated.\" Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican who is in the Airbus camp, said that the Pentagon rebid decision was \"an appropriate solution.\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160201184126/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/business/10tanker.html?hp"}, {"title": "Pentagon Issues New Tanker Bid Parameters", "date": "2008-08-06", "content": "The Pentagon plans to take extra capabilities - including added fuel offload capacity - into account as it scores revised proposals from Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS that could lead to $35 billion in work replacing aging KC-135 tankers. The Defense Department will consider \"value over threshold\" when reviewing the revised offers, said Shay Assad, director of defense procurement and acquisitions policy, during an Aug. 6 briefing at the Pentagon. This could put Boeing's 767-200LRF-based proposal at a disadvantage as its cargo, passenger and fuel offload abilities are hampered by its size compared to the larger Airbus A330-200 design proposed by Northrop. Today, a revised draft request for proposals (RFP) for the KC-X refueling tanker was provided to both teams, kicking off the recompetition of the controversial program. The new draft RFP is intended to provide \"clear and unambiguous insight into the relative order of importance\" of various capabilities, including fuel offload, cargo and passenger capacity and survivability, among other aspects. Assad did not identify the capabilities in order of importance, and DOD officials did not publicly release the draft RFP, breaking with typical protocol, which calls for solicitations to be posted publicly online. The draft was, however, sent to Congress and is already drawing criticism because it may favor the larger A330 offering. (Click here (6.1-meg pdf) and here (1.2-meg pdf) for the documents). For instance, an aide to Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Wash.) argued there is an obvious change inserted into the system requirements document in the revised tanker RFP that \"clearly\" favors the larger Airbus aircraft \"even though it is not necessarily connected to any real-world use of tanker.\" The congressional Government Accountability Office found that in the earlier competition the Air Force did not clearly articulate how it would score attributes that surpassed the threshold requirements for the system. This, among other irregularities, called into question the Northrop Grumman/EADS North America win of a $1.5 billion development contract for the new refueler Feb. 29. Both teams will have about one week to discuss the draft RFP with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. By mid-month, a final RFP will be released and contractors will have about 45 days to submit their revised proposals. Source selection should be finished by the end of the year with a final winner announced by New Year's Eve, Assad said. The existing contract with Northrop Grumman will remain in stop-work status until a winner is selected. If Northrop Grumman again prevails, its contract will be revised and restarted. If, however, Boeing wins this new competition, Northrop's contract will be terminated, he said. The Pentagon does plan to shift the life-cycle cost estimates from an expected useful life of 25 years to 40 years on the aircraft, Assad says. And, it will take into consideration the cost of fuel and anticipated fuel burn rates of each aircraft throughout those years.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110521065951/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&id=news%2FREVISED08068.xml"}, {"title": "DoD Announces Termination of KC-X Tanker Solicitation", "date": "2008-09-10", "content": "Today, the Department of Defense notified the Congress and the two competing contractors, Boeing and Northrop Grumman, that it is terminating the current competition for a U.S. Air Force airborne tanker replacement. Secretary Gates, in consultation with senior Defense and Air Force officials, has determined that the solicitation and award cannot be accomplished by January. Rather than hand the next Administration an incomplete and possibly contested process, Secretary Gates decided that the best course of action is to provide the next Administration with full flexibility regarding the requirements, evaluation criteria and the appropriate allocation of defense budget to this mission. Secretary Gates stated, \"Over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the Department of Defense. It is my judgment that in the time remaining to us, we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment. The resulting \"cooling off\" period will allow the next Administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the KC-X.\" In making this decision, it was concluded that the current KC-135 fleet can be adequately maintained to satisfy Air Force missions for the near future. Sufficient funds will be recommended in the FY09 and follow-on budgets to maintain the KC-135 at high-mission capable rates. In addition, the Department will recommend to the Congress the disposition of the pending FY09 funding for the tanker program and plans to continue funding the KC-X program in the FY10 to FY15 budget presently under review.

Dennis Muilenburg, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said the Boeing NewGen Tanker will satisfy all mandatory Air Force requirements and offer an American-made tanker that will be capable, survivable, and combat-ready at the lowest cost to the taxpayer. \"Having supplied tankers to the Air Force for the past 60 years, Boeing has drawn on its unmatched aerial-refueling experience to thoroughly review and evaluate the KC-X solicitation issued by the Air Force,\" Muilenburg said. \"We respect and understand the KC-X requirements, and appreciate the importance of this program for the United States and its warfighters. We intend to bid for the honor to work with our Air Force customer to replace the existing fleet of KC-135 aircraft with a new-generation, multi-role tanker in a fair and transparent acquisition process.\" Boeing studied the mission requirements closely to determine the optimal airframe size that would deliver the most capability for the lowest cost to own and operate. The result was the NewGen Tanker, a widebody, multi-mission aircraft based on the proven Boeing 767 commercial aircraft, updated with the latest and most advanced technology and capable of fulfilling the Air Force's needs for transport of fuel, cargo, passengers and patients. The multi-mission aircraft is named NewGen because it includes several state-of-the-art systems to meet the demanding mission requirements of the future. They include: A digital flight deck featuring electronic displays taken directly from the most advanced commercial airliner in existence -- the Boeing 787 Dreamliner -- that show all flight attitude, navigation, engine indication and crew-alerting information on screens 75 percent larger than on a commercial Airbus A330. A new-generation fly-by-wire boom with an expanded refueling envelope and increased fuel offload rate. It will meet the Air Force requirement and simplify refueling operations to reduce workload for the aircrew and improve safety and reliability. Boeing is the only team in the KC-X competition that has invented, manufactured and delivered combat-tested aerial refueling booms. The Boeing NewGen Tanker will be controlled by the aircrew, which has unrestricted access to the full flight envelope for threat avoidance at any time, rather than allowing computer software to limit combat maneuverability. The NewGen Tanker will meet all of the Air Force's 372 requirements -- including a production rate at whatever level the Air Force determines -- with a low-risk approach to manufacturing that relies on existing Boeing facilities in Washington state and Kansas as well as U.S. suppliers throughout the nation, with decades of experience delivering dependable military tanker and derivative aircraft. \"The NewGen Tanker will draw on the experience and talents of an integrated U.S. Tanker Team, including the best of our Boeing defense and commercial businesses and our nationwide supplier network,\" said Jim Albaugh, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \"It's a proven team and existing infrastructure that is ready to deliver these NewGen Tankers on Day One.\" More cost-effective to own and operate than the larger, heavier Airbus airplane, the Boeing NewGen Tanker will save American taxpayers more than $10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year service life because it burns 24 percent less fuel. The Boeing NewGen Tanker program also will support substantially more jobs in the United States than an Airbus A330 tanker that is designed and largely manufactured in Europe. Boeing has been designing, building, modifying and supporting tankers for decades. Those tankers include the KC-135 that will be replaced in the KC-X competition, and the KC-10 fleet. The company also has delivered four KC-767Js to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and is on contract to deliver four KC-767s to the Italian Air Force. Three of the four Italian tankers are in flight test, with the fourth airplane in production. The Air Force released its final KC-X Request for Proposal on Feb. 24.

It includes state-of-the-art systems to meet the demanding mission requirements of the future, including a digital flight deck featuring Boeing 787 Dreamliner electronic displays and a cockpit-design philosophy that places the pilot in command rather than allowing computer software to limit combat maneuverability.

The offering, which is currently being evaluated by the USAF along with the EADS North America KC-45 for an initial 179-aircraft requirement, will also feature a new boom. NewGen Tanker programme manager Jean Chamberlin says the new boom will have \"a wider envelope than the KC-10 and is fully digitalised\". She declines to provide more details for proprietary reasons but says it will \"absolutely\" be developed in time for initial operating capability in 2017. The new boom is the biggest difference between the NewGen Tanker and the four delayed KC-767 tankers that Boeing is now preparing to deliver to Italy. \"Boeing and the Italian air force will seek to deliver the first two KC-767s by the end of this year,\" the company says. Chamberlin, speaking to Flightglobal after addressing employees at a 27 September rally in Everett to promote the NewGen Tanker programme, also confirms that the tanker's cockpit will feature four large Rockwell Collins displays similar to those on the 787 and also now installed on the 777 and 767-400ER. The latest technologies will also be incorporated at the operator station, where Chamberlin says there will be a \"three-dimensional view\". She says the NewGen Tanker will also feature a \"computer-aided boom that allows you to ensure alignment\". It will be able to \"refuel any aircraft in the inventory of the US government and many of our foreign allies\". Chamberlin declines to discuss fuselage and wing specifications. But another Boeing source says the NewGen Tanker will have a 159ft (48.5m) wingspan and 156ft fuselage length, matching the footprint of the 767-200. The aircraft will borrow the cargo door and floor rollers from the 767-300F. The source says Boeing decided against incorporating the fuselage and wing from the larger 767-300 to give the USAF more flexibility in operating into smaller airfields. The company believes the 767-200 is ideal for meeting the service's requirement for \"best performance and smallest footprint\". Boeing marketing documents illustrate as an example the tight ramp at Royal Air Force base Akrotiri in Cyprus, which was used during Operation \"Desert Storm\". Boeing claims this can accommodate only six Airbus A330-200-based KC-45 tankers, or nine KC-767 NewGen Tankers at one time. Although each A330 can carry more fuel, the total amount of fuel and passengers that can be carried with a mission at Akrotiri is higher with the Boeing solution. Boeing chief executive Jim Albaugh told the rally the NewGen Tanker will be able to operate into twice as many airfields as the A330. Its claimed superior fuel efficiency will also result in savings that according to Washington Congressmen Norm Dicks will amount to $25 billion to $30 billion over 40 years. Albaugh says he expects a decision from the USAF, which has been reviewing Boeing's NewGen Tanker proposal since July, in late November or early December. While the initial requirement is only for 179 KC-135 replacements, he estimates Boeing will ultimately produce 400 to 500 NewGen Tankers for the USAF and \"air forces around the world\". Chamberlin says Boeing has already begun preparations to ensure it can deliver 18 aircraft in 78 months after the winning bid is selected. She says the manufacturer is \"laser-focused for day one\" and will be ready to start producing 767-based tankers for the USAF \"when the clock starts\".

Boeing has proposed a military version of its 767 airliner, to be built on its Everett assembly line alongside commercial jets. EADS is offering an Airbus A330 tanker, to be assembled at a new wide-body jet facility in Mobile, Ala., along with commercial A330 freighter jets. Since both contending airplanes meet all the mandatory-performance requirements, the terms of the competition mandate that the lowest price should be decisive. Boeing CEO Jim McNerney on Thursday said Boeing's final bid price is \"aggressive but responsible.\" Speaking to analysts at a conference in New York, The Associated Press reported, McNerney told his audience: \"The people in this room would be glad if we won at the bid level that we've put in, and would be happy if we lost at a lower level.\" However, price in the end may not be the deciding factor because the contest has become heavily politicized. Boeing supporters in Congress have characterized the lengthy contest as a fight between U.S. and European interests. Boeing claims that over 40 years, a 767 win would support 50,000 jobs around the U.S., with about 11,000 of those in Washington state. Airbus claims that an A330 tanker win would support 48,000 American jobs. Neither side provides details to support their figures. Boeing executives and their Congressional supporters have so far failed to persuade the Pentagon to take into account illegal subsidies EADS received in development of the A330. There are signs the contest may drag on beyond the Air Force decision, which is expected next month. Boeing appears ready to consider another formal protest if EADS wins. In 2008, Boeing successfully protested a previous award of the contract to EADS on procedural grounds. This time, the basis of another protest could lie in a mistake by the Air Force procurement office last November. In that incident, data on the Boeing plane was inadvertently sent to Airbus. The Air Force tried to fix the error by giving both sides access to the corresponding data on its rival, but Boeing has continued to query what happened. Boeing CEO McNerney put forward Boeing's view of what's at stake in a statement Thursday: \"This decision is critical to America's national security and its manufacturing base,\" McNerney said. In contrast, EADS North America Chairman Ralph Crosby chose not to look through that political lens, instead insisting that Airbus' jet is better for the Air Force mission. \"We're proud to compete on the merits of our tanker offering and support the warfighter's right to choose the aircraft they will go to war in,\" said Crosby. The contract is worth $35 billion directly, to replace the current fleet of Boeing-built KC-135 tankers with 179 new tankers.

That allowed the air force's evaluation team to bypass a set of 96 non-mandatory requirements that would only have been triggered if there was less than a 1% differential between the two bids, Donley says. The air force's decision was met with \"disappointment and concern\" by EADS, which previously defeated a Boeing bid for the same contract in 2008. That award was later overturned after Boeing protested the outcome. The USAF relaunched the competition in September, 2009 with a new acquisition strategy that forced the competitors into a pricing war. EADS says its review of the air force's decision \"will take some time\". The KC-X bid offered the company an opportunity to establish a new manufacturing base in Mobile, Alabama, as well as forge a network of suppliers across the country. \"We owe it to them to conduct a thorough analysis,\" says EADS chairman Ralph Crosby. Donley urged the losing bidder to respect the air force's decision and allow the process to move forward. \"We hope that all parties recognise the thorough process and intense, multiple levels of review that have gone into this source selection and will respect this opinion and allow this important procurement to proceed unimpeded,\" Donley says. It is clear that Boeing had several advantages on price by offering the KC-767. The KC-45's maximum takeoff weight is more than 25% heavier than the KC-767, and extra weight usually implies more cost to build. Moreover, as a smaller aircraft the KC-767 is expected to burn less fuel in absolute terms. Rep Norm Dicks, a Washington-based Democrat, helped to improve this advantage by successfully pressing the USAF to increase the lifecycle measure for fuel burn from 30 years to 40 years. \"I think that's an important part of the overall equation,\" Muilenberg says. However, EADS officials had become increasingly confident that the KC-45 would be competitive with Boeing's pricing on the KC-767. Last week, Crosby told reporters that he considered price an \"opportunity\" for EADS to win in the competition. He also indicated that EADS would protest only if the company discovered a signficant discrepancy between the evaluation criteria and the basis for contract award. The air force intends to finalise a $3.5 billion contract to complete a system development and demonstration phase, which includes delivering four test aircraft. Boeing is required to deliver the first 18 KC-46As to enter service within six years of contract award. The production phase spans over 13 years for building all 179 aircraft. Meanwhile, Boeing has confirmed that first flight is scheduled in 2015. It remains unclear how much risk Boeing has accepted to meet the KC-X contract requirements. The company has never disclosed the exact configuration of the KC-767 New Gen Tanker airframe, nor its refuelling systems. \"We won't be rolling out any of those\" details in the near future, Muilenberg says. The air force has been seeking to award a contract to replace its aging Boeing KC-135s for most of the last decade. \"I'm pleased at how this produced an outcome ... that we will get about delivering a capability that's long overdue,\" Gen Norton Schwartz, chief of staff of the air force, \"and we'll stop talking about it.\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20121105081038/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/updated-usaf-selects-boeing-for-kc-x-contract-353642/"}, {"title": "Boeing Receives US Air Force Contract to Build Next-Generation Refueling Tanker", "date": "2011-02-24", "content": "The Boeing Company has received a contract from the U.S. Air Force to build the next-generation aerial refueling tanker aircraft that will replace 179 of the service's 400 KC-135 tankers.

Johnson described the \"lean production line\" that Boeing has established at Everett to build the KC-46s in line with commercial 767s. Previous Boeing KC-767s were flown green from Everett to Wichita, where all of the work required to convert them into tanker-transports was done. KC-46s will emerge from Everett in a configuration designated the 767-2C Provisioned Freighter, with main-deck cargo doors and floors, body tanks and other tanker provisions, including the enhanced flight deck.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Air Force released a list of bases in the running to house some of the first KC-46A tankers that roll of the assembly line. Pease Air Guard Base is among those under consideration. With the guts of a Boeing 767 commercial airplane, the new KC-46A tanker will present a significant advancement over the existing fleet of aging KC-135 Stratotankers. It comes equipped with worldwide navigation and communication systems, airlift capability on the entire main deck and improved \"force protection\" features, among other things. Because of its design, the new aircraft can also be used for a variety of purposes beyond air refueling, such as evacuating people and moving cargo. The Air Force considered a field of 83 guard bases before cutting the options down to five this week, according to an announcement from Air Force 1st Lt. Aaron McCarthy, Wing Executive Officer of the 157th Air Refueling Wing, which is headquartered at Pease. \"It's obviously a good thing to be on the list,\" McCarthy said Wednesday. \"It just shows the hard work we've done.\" In addition to Pease, the other guard facilities being considered by the Air Force to house the KC-46A are Forbes Air Guard Station in Kansas, Joint-Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, Pittsburgh International Airport Air Guard Station in Pennsylvania and Rickenbacker Air Guard Station in Ohio. The Air Force has contracted with Boeing to make 179 KC-46As. The first tankers are scheduled to be available in fiscal 2016, and production is scheduled to continue for about another decade after that. The Air Guard base chosen to house the first KC-46As will begin receiving them in fiscal 2018. An Air Force \"site activation task force team\" will now visit all of the bases under consideration during the next several weeks. During the review, the team will assess operational and training requirements, potential impacts to existing missions, housing, infrastructure, and manpower at each base. They will also develop cost estimates for moving the aircraft to each facility. Once the site surveys are complete, the results will be reported to the Air Force secretary and chief of staff, who will select \"preferred\" sites, as well as alternatives. The decision is expected by this spring. After, the Air Force will launch extensive environmental impact studies at the chosen locations. The process is expected to continue into 2014. One advantage Pease holds in the basing process is its proximity to the \"refueling track,\" or travel path, that more than 90 percent of all fighter aircraft use to reach operations in the Middle East. Planes carrying cargo and personnel to Europe and Africa also pass within a few minutes of Pease. Members of the 157th Air Refueling Wing say another argument in favor of bringing KC-46As to Pease is the base's track record of putting planes to use. Pease has remained open 24 hours a day since the Sept. 11 attacks. With refueling missions scheduled at all hours, guard troops at Pease flew more hours per airplane last year than any other Air National Guard unit in the country. Another factor that has contributed to high utilization is the fact that Pease is home to three KC-135 active associations, according to an announcement from the 157th Air Refueling Wing. The associations comprise both Air National Guard and active duty personnel. \"The 157th Air Refueling Wing has the ideal combination of strategic location, total force personnel and infrastructure to give the country the optimum performance and efficiency of air refueling operations,\" Wing Commander Paul Hutchinson said in a prepared statement. New Hampshire's two U.S. senators have both wielded their authority on the Senate Armed Services Committee to make the case in favor of Pease Air Guard Base. They praised Wednesday's announcement in a joint statement. \"This is welcome news for Pease and the 157th Air Refueling Wing, which provides the best tanker support in the Air National Guard,\" Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Kelly Ayotte said in a written remark. \"As the Air Force's evaluation process moves forward, Pease continues to be well-positioned to receive the new tanker.\" In addition to selecting a Guard base, the Air Force will also send KC-46As to one active duty base and one so-called \"formal training unit.\" Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma and McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas are the two bases being considered in the training unit category. Altus is also in the running to house KC-46As as an active duty base. Also being considered are Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington, Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota and McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas.

Compared to the Eisenhower-era KC-135 Stratotanker, the KC-46 is projected to have improved fuel efficiency, a greater fuel capacity, and much more cargo, passenger and aero-medical capability, said Maj. Gen. John Thompson, the Tanker Program executive officer and KC-46 program director. The new aircraft is a derivative of the Boeing 767 and commercial-derivatives are typically more dependable and less expensive to maintain than military-only aircraft. Air Force leaders re-evaluated previous usage estimates, based on KC-135 averages, and decided these changes were appropriate to better utilize the full potential of the KC-46. They decided an increase of 2.5 to 3.5 aircrews assigned per KC-46 was necessary to facilitate surge capabilities and to meet contingency operations requirements per the 2012 Defense Strategy. Overall, the increase will add approximately 60 total aircrews to the force and allow the Air Force to fly more missions using the KC-46. Decisions also include the basing strategy of the KC-46 with an increased focus on 'total force associations.' Basically, active-duty and reserve units will share aircraft allowing the KC-46 utilization rates to be much higher than current KC-135 rates. Air Force leaders informed Congress of the increased flying hours due to the basing strategy and concept of operations changes along with the anticipated 11.2 percent future cost growth in the estimated operations and support costs due to increased usage. The KC-46A is the service's first step to replace its aging air refueling fleet. It will provide enhanced refueling capability and increased cargo and aero-medical evacuation capacity. The first 18 aircraft are slated to be delivered by August 2017. The total operations and support costs are now predicted to be approximately $103 billion, but there is no increase in acquisition cost. Leaders stress the increase to operations and support is because this aircraft will be used more often and more effectively than current aircraft - not because it's more expensive to operate. 'It's completely a result of the basing and (concept of operations) changes and is in no way reflecting increased costs to operate the aircraft. We're just flying it more,' Thompson said.

Pease, which is one of five Air National Guard installations in the running to receive the KC-46A, could potentially be selected as either a \"preferred\" or \"reasonable alternative\" location for the new refueling tanker. Other finalists are Forbes Air Guard Station in Kansas, Joint-Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, Pittsburgh International Airport Air Guard Station in Pennsylvania and Rickenbacker Air Guard Station in Ohio. The Air National Guard base chosen as the \"preferred\" location will be scheduled to receive the aircraft beginning in fiscal year 2018. According to Boeing, the company contracted to deliver 179 KC-46A aircraft to the U.S. Air Force, the new tanker will revolutionize the Air Force's air mobility mission. It will replace the KC-135 Stratotanker that the Air National Guard flies out of Pease. The Air Force is not expected to begin buying the new aircraft until 2017. Officials hope to get 12 of the new tankers at the local Air National Guard base. The KC-46 is capable of delivering more fuel, three times more cargo pallets and up to twice as many passengers than the KC-135. In March, Col. Paul Hutchinson, commander of the 157th Air Refueling Wing, said Pease's strategic location, efficient operations with low operating costs and high aircraft-utilization rates, and its highly successful resident active duty flying squadron make it an ideal location for basing the KC-46A.

Mission systems will be installed at a separate facility, a process modeled after Boeing's \"in-line\" production of the P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, a 737 derivative, for the U.S. and Indian navies. \"When we start building the tanker airplane on the commercial line, it will be built from scratch as a tanker,\" Howitt told aviation reporters earlier this month.

This formal closure of the July Weapon System Design Review represents the culmination of more than 10 months of component and sub-system design reviews, resolution of all resulting action items and completion of all CDR criteria established in the Air Force's contract with Boeing. Closure of CDR formally establishes the KC-46 design and now allows the program to progress into its manufacturing and development test phases. The KC-46 is based on the Boeing 767-200ER commercial aircraft. Design review activities blended best practices of commercial and Department of Defense frameworks, leading to overall improvements. Boeing will now proceed with integration, verification, and production of four engineering and manufacturing development aircraft to support flight testing, scheduled to begin in mid-2014. The first fully equipped KC-46 tanker is projected to fly in early 2015. \"This build and test phase is another critical step toward meeting the KC-46 contractual Required Assets Available date -- a milestone requiring 18 KC-46 aircraft and all necessary support to be on the ramp, ready to support warfighter needs by the August 2017 timeframe,\" said Maj.

In a presentation at the Air Force Association's 2013 Air & Space Conference & Technology Exposition, Maj. Gen. John Thompson, Air Force program executive officer for Tankers, outlined continued progress in the KC-46's design and acquisition timeline. Eighteen combat-ready KC-46 aircraft are slated to be made by 2017, and will eventually replace about a third of the current KC-135 Stratotanker fleet. \"The tanker crews -- pilots, boom operators, maintainers -- are conducting about 150 sorties and refueling about 450 aircraft a day, keeping the 'global' in global reach, global vigilance and global power,\" Thompson said. While today's refueling fleet has done the job, the general said a new aircraft is needed. \"The KC-135s are nearly 51-years old. It is a fantastic weapon system, but our operators and maintainers need something new and better.\" In August, Air Force officials locked down the KC-46 design - an important milestone for the program. Finalizing the design, Thompson said, represented 10 months of component and subsystem design examinations, which allowed the program to progress into its manufacturing and test phases. The review processes benefited from commercial and Department of Defense best practices, leading to overall improvements and projected cost-savings, Thompson said. Concurrent with preparations for the flight test phase of the program, officials are working to ensure technical performance is verified. Lead contractor Boeing, meanwhile, is continuing to produce four test aircraft for flight testing, which is scheduled to begin in mid-2014. Based on Boeing's 767, the first aircraft to be assembled will begin test in a 767-2C provisioned freighter configuration before undergoing modification to become a KC-46 tanker. The second aircraft is projected to fly as a KC-46 tanker in early 2015, with an expected delivery of 179 KC-46 tankers by 2028, Thompson said. As the process moves from drawing to metal, Thompson said the program hit a number of milestones this year, including the award of a training contract, base selection for the tanker in May, and the start of production on the first test aircraft in late June. Assembly of the second test aircraft began in August, putting the program on track to have four test aircraft assembled by the middle of next year. \"We are 40 percent done with the development program ... and most of the requirements have been met early,\" Thompson said. \"Our way forward is to continue with good contract execution, to prepare for and execute an efficient test program, and to develop the long-term sustainment strategy for the future KC-46 fleet.\" Thompson said while there is a considerable amount of uncertainty relative to sequestration in fiscal 2014, maintaining stability and support for the program is essential to keeping the pace of the process. \"Requirements and funding stability are absolutely key,\" the general said. \"As the number one modernization program, I'm sure (Air Force leaders) will do what they can to protect this very critical program as we go forward.\"", "url": "https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/467143/kc-46-progress-hinges-on-requirements-funding-stability/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "First KC-46A Baseline Test Aircraft Due This Month", "date": "2014-01-12", "content": "The first of four Air Force KC-46A baseline test aircraft will complete major assembly later this month before taking off on its first scheduled test-flight later this summer, Air Force and Boeing officials said. Although only a developmental flight of a test aircraft, the upcoming flight marks a significant milestone in a long Air Force effort to build a new aerial tanker for its fleet. The upcoming test flight of the 767 2C developmental aircraft, called a provision freighter, will begin an extensive testing, evaluation and certification process in the Air Force's multi-year effort to replace its aging KC-135 and KC-10 tanker fleets, Maj. Gen. John Thompson, Program Executive Officer for Tankers, told Military\u200b.com in an interview. \"The first aircraft will go directly into the flight test program where it will start working on FAA certification test points - proving that the aircraft can fly at the altitudes it is committed to flying at, proving that it can take off and land at the distances it has committed to, and ensuring that it can go from one altitude to another altitude,\" Thompson said. The Air Force's multi-year tanker procurement program is one of the service's top two priorities. The average KC-135 is about 50 years old and the average KC-10 tanker is roughly 29 years old, Thompson said. The 165-foot KC-46A is being built with Pratt and Whitney engines and the ability to transport up to 212,000 pounds of fuel and 65,000 pounds of cargo. The aircraft will bring an improved ability to conduct aerial refueling missions, Thompson said. The KC-46A will refuel F-22s, F-15s, F-16s, F-35s, C-17 and KC 10s, among others. For instance, the new tanker will have and improved ability to refuel aircraft via the probe and drogue while also using a boom and receptacle on a single mission. The aircraft can conduct multiple refueling missions concurrently using a drogue, or refueling mechanism on the wings, and a more standard boom and receptacle system. Thompson explained that the 767s are being engineered and manufactured with some military specifications in mind so as to prevent the need to strip down the aircraft and fully re-configure it for military use, as has often been the case with prior Air Force aircraft acquisition efforts. \"We are provisioning by drilling the holes that we need and installing the structures that we need for KC 46 - so that when we get to the finishing center, it will not require to be torn apart. It will instead just go through an installation procedure,\" he explained. Boeing officials also say production and assembly of the first aircraft is progressing successfully. \"We are going to complete major assembly this month. Once we complete the airframe we still have to do ground vibration testing, add the body fuel tanks and other instrumentation testing,\" Jerry Drelling, a spokesman for the KC-46 tanker program. The testing of the first developmental aircraft will also measure the aircraft's rate to climb and rate to descend, Thompson added. The Engineering Manufacturing and Design, or EMD, model aircraft, being built at a Boeing facility in Everett, Wash., will ultimately go to a special Boeing location about 30 miles south of Everett where they will be configured with the requisite instrumentation, electronics and technologies necessary for the aircraft to become military-ready KC-46A tankers, Thompson said. The first flight of a fully-integrated, military ready KC-46A aircraft is slated for January of 2015, Thompson said. The second developmental aircraft, or EMD 2, is slated to roll out of the Everett factory later this year before heading to the special Boeing field location for additional integration. Overall, the Air Force plans to acquire 179 KC-46A tankers between 2015 and 2028, Thompson explained. Current plans call for low rate initial production of seven aircraft in 2015, 12 aircraft in 2016 and then 15 per year between 2017 and 2027, he added. Part of the tanker acquisition effort includes a contract specification for the Air Force to acquire 18 KC-46As by 2017. \"We've had a strong focus executing on this program. We remain on plan to deliver 18 combat-ready KC-46A tankers by 2017,\" Drelling said. The government estimates the developmental costs of the tanker effort at $5.7 billion, however a new estimate is currently being worked on and will be available later this year, Thompson said. Thompson said the test program involves an ambitious effort to concurrently perform developmental testing, operational testing and FAA certification. \"We're optimizing the flight test program so that each flight test will maximize the amount of data collected to satisfy multiple different test agencies. This is a cost and schedule savings for the program,\" he explained. Once combat ready, the KC-46 will carry about 10-percent more gas than the KC-135 and be engineered with aircraft infrared countermeasures for crew protection. The aircraft will also be configured with some electronic warfare capability, Thompson said.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140115070255/http://www.dodbuzz.com/2014/01/12/first-kc-46a-baseline-test-aircraft-due-this-month/"}, {"title": "Boeing assembles final KC-46A test aircraft", "date": "2014-01-16", "content": "Boeing is now assembling the last of four KC-46A test aircraft that the company is producing for the US Air Force's next-generation aerial refueling tanker programme, the Chicago-based company announces.

The U.S. Force has dubbed its Boeing-built KC-46 tanker Pegasus, which was announced at the Air Force Association's Air Warfare Symposium Feb. 20 in Orlando, Fla. The KC-46 tanker, which Boeing won over Airbus after a long and convoluted competition, is based on the 767 air frame and is now being assembled at Boeing's Everett factory. Naming the plane Pegasus will make the aircraft more distinct and memorable, similar to the personality given to the 737-based P-8A submarine killer by naming it Poseidon. As a winged horse, Pegasus is, however more easily visualized than Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, generally portrayed as a male human. Pegasus is also easier to spell correctly. In June 2011, attorney Tayloe Washburn found another use for the name Pegasus. That time it was to put a face on Washington's effort to win the 737 Max assembly, a project he had been given by then-Gov. Chris Gregoire. At the time, Washburn told us that he had chosen the name Pegasus after asking a friend of his with classics training for the name of a Greek mythological figure \"in transportation.\" Currently, Boeing is building the first four test Pegasus tankers, out of an initial $4.9 billion order of 18, at the north side of Boeing's mammoth Everett assembly plant. The first is to be unveiled at the end of 2014, with first flight in 2015, said tanker program spokesman Jerry Drelling, in an email. The Air Force eventually plans to buy 179 tankers, to replace the aging KC-135 tanker fleet, based on Boeing 707s. In a peppy email, Drelling said Boeing likes the Air Force name. \"In Greek mythology, the meaning of the name Pegasus carries an emphasis on helping others, and doing that in many ways,\" he wrote. \"Given the KC-46A tanker's multi-role capabilities - air refueling and the transportation of patients, passengers and cargo - the U.S. Air Force couldn't have settled on a better, more inspirational name.\"", "url": "https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2014/02/27/pegasus-as-name-for-kc-46-tanker-will.html"}, {"title": "USAF: McConnell to house next generation tankers", "date": "2014-04-22", "content": "The United States Air Force has announced a final decision to base the new KC-46A tankers at McConnell Air Force Base.

Carl Brewer, Wichita Mayor, said the next generation tankers are expected to bring a $619 million impact to the area. \"This is fantastic news for an outstanding facility staffed by even more outstanding airmen,\" U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Wichita, said. U.S. Senator Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, said McConnell is, and will continue to be the nation's super tanker base. U.S. Senator Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, said Wichita is the perfect home for the new mission. \"The men and women who will operate and maintain the KC-46A at McConnell are part of a community of unwavering support for their critical mission and a deep understanding of the support their families and loved ones need back home,\" Roberts said.

Mike Pompeo's office announced Tuesday. The decision gives the green light for the base to start spending $219 million to prepare for the arrival of the tankers. \"Once they've begun to spend that money, there's no turning back,\" Pompeo said. The Air Force made the announcement in a phone call to the congressman Tuesday evening, confirming that McConnell had passed its environmental impact study, the last hurdle in the process. McConnell has been tapped to receive 36 new tankers beginning in early 2016, putting the base in position to be a key factor in the Air Force's plans for decades to come. The new tankers eventually will replace the base's 1950s-era KC-135 tankers. The Air Force selected McConnell in May 2013 to become the first main active-duty base to receive the new tankers but did so pending the outcome of the environmental study. Such a study is required by federal law any time a new aircraft is assigned to a base. Bids already have been taken for $219 million in construction to prepare McConnell for the arrival of the tankers. But contracts couldn't be signed or construction started until the official decision on the study was made public. \"We learned a month ago the study was complete, and there didn't appear to be anything that would cause a different decision,\" Pompeo said, \"but they still had a formal series of things to do to make a 'record of decision,' the document that lets the contracting folks and the folks at McConnell and the secretary of the Air Force green-light the spending of money.\" Of the $219 million earmarked for improvements at McConnell, $194 million is for building three hangars. The construction, expected to begin in 2015, comes as construction on school bond projects is winding down in Wichita. Tuesday's announcement caps a long decision-making process on the tanker and ends any chance the Air Force could award the first tankers to Washington state, where a congressional delegation had been lobbying for the Air Force to change its mind and place the tankers at Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane. Fairchild and McConnell were among the four finalists named by the Air Force in January 2013 to receive the tankers as the main active-duty base in the first round of assignments. A successful environmental impact study was expected because the base has been home to the KC-135 tankers for decades. \"There's no reason we won't be flying the 46s just as long,\" Pompeo said. Approval lauded: Pompeo and Kansas' U.S. senators celebrated the announcement. \"The decision to expand America's commitment to South Central Kansas will last decades,\" Pompeo said in a written statement, \"and I'm confident McConnell will excel in its renewed mission.\" \"The upcoming arrival of the new KC-46A tanker fleet at McConnell translates into an economic boost for the community, which will endure for years to come as each phase of preparation is completed,\" Sen. Jerry Moran said in a written statement. \"I am grateful the efforts to ensure this outcome were successful and that the Air Force truly understands the value of air mobility assets in Kansas.\" Sen. Pat Roberts said in a prepared statement that he was proud of the airmen at McConnell for earning the mission. \"Once again, Kansas will be taking a leading role in protecting our national security by providing next generation capability in global reach,\" Roberts' statement said. \"As the Air Capital of the World, Wichita is the perfect home for this new mission.\" In Wichita, City Council member Janet Miller called the announcement \"fantastic news.\" It's good to have McConnell's future assured in Wichita, she said. \"It's a big component of Wichita's economy and a big component of our citizenry who live, shop and spend money here.\" Vice Mayor Jeff Blubaugh also welcomed the news. \"McConnell has a long history with the tanker refueling program, and I'm just excited for the opportunity to take on the next generation of those tankers,\" he said. Tanker timetable: The first fully equipped, combat-ready KC-46As should be built by January or February, Pompeo said. McConnell should take delivery of its first tanker 12 months later. The new tanker should be ready to fly by the end of the first quarter in 2017. Meanwhile, McConnell will continue flying the KC-135s, transitioning to the new tankers as they arrive. The 36 new tankers will trickle into the base over several years because Boeing will build 12 to 18 each year, Pompeo's office has said. Boeing has a $35 billion contract to build 179 new tankers by 2027. Some of the new tankers will go to two other bases selected for separate categories. For example, Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma was picked as the formal training base for the KC-46A and will eventually get eight tankers. Another round of base assignment of new tankers is expected to be held in a couple of years. The Air Force has said it hopes to eventually have 10 bases with new tankers. Military and political leaders have said it was important that McConnell land the tankers during the first-round competition because of uncertainties about future defense spending.

Despite the delay, Air Force Maj. Gen. John Thompson, program executive officer for the KC-46 program, says he is confident the Boeing-led team can deliver the first 18 tankers by August 2017, as required in the contract. \"We don't see anything of great concern there that would really worry us about the ability to get to required assets available [RAA] ... in the August of '17 timeframe,\" Thompson tells Aviation Week during a Sept. 11 interview. However, \"Schedule performance must improve,\" he says. Boeing won the $4.4 billion development contract on Feb. 24, 2011; the fixed-price terms of the deal limit the government's cost to $4.9 billion. A 2013 cost and risk assessment put total cost of the development at $5.9 billion, Thompson says. Boeing is responsible for paying any overage to meet the 2017 milestone. Ultimately, the Air Force plans to buy 179 of the tankers as the first of three potential tranches of KC-135 replacements. The company announced a $272 million charge this summer to keep the program on track. At issue was insufficient separation in some of the wiring bundles on the 767-2C baseline platform. Wiring bundles were one of the items that required a new design for the tanker variant because the Air Force requires double- or even triple-redundant wiring for some mission systems. The baseline 767 has about 70 mi. of wiring in the design; the 2C adds about 50 mi. to that, Thompson says. Along with redundancy, some of the wiring for specific systems must be separated by a certain distance for safety reasons. Boeing realized earlier this year while preparing for FAA testing that in 5-10% of the bundles safe separation distance for the wiring systems fell short or the wires were not properly shielded. The poor design was \"due to discrepancies traced to a transition of design tools,\" Boeing spokeswoman Caroline Hutcheson says. \"While it in no way mitigates our disappointment in taking a charge, the issues here are well-defined and understood. There's no new technology involved, just additional work that has to be accomplished.\" Some of the wiring had already been installed in the first of four test aircraft for the program, driving program officials to remove some equipment. The other three test aircraft have been produced and are parked at Boeing's facility awaiting the newly designed wiring bundles. However, production of these jets was to be fairly concurrent, and the redesign issue has shifted this work into a \"serial process,\" creating a possible choke point for executing flight testing for the program. The 767-2C was specifically designed for the tanker role. It is a 767-200ER modified with a strengthened main-deck cargo floor, cargo door and freighter features, 787-based cockpit, auxiliary fuel tanks and plumbing and wiring to support the refueling boom and mission systems. Boeing is building these features into the 767-2C as it is being built on the commercial production line in Everett, Washington, to minimize tear down and time to add mission systems at its finishing facility. First flight for the first KC-46, which will be the second developmental aircraft (the first will be used in the 2C configuration for the amended and supplemental type FAA certification) is slated for April 2015, and Thompson said that schedule is holding, for now. But \"if we don't get the KC-46 variant in the air that first week of April, then we really start pushing almost a day-for-day slip of the Milestone C [Pentagon production decision], which is currently scheduled for September of next year.\" He notes that if the Milestone C decision from Pentagon procurement chief Frank Kendall slips \"a little bit to the right, that is not a death knell for the August of '17 RAA.\" However, the slippage in 2C production is further emphasizing the development and production concurrency built into the KC-46 program. Officials said at the outset of the program this strategy carried little risk, owing to Boeing's experience overseeing commercial-to-military conversions. However, flight testing will only have just begun on the 2C at the time of the Pentagon decision to produce the first 13 operational aircraft. Further, the program is embracing a new \"Test Once\" concept that is designed to maximize the number of test points for different agencies accomplished in each test sortie. The delay could put further pressure on this new system. Thompson says he is exploring options to mitigate schedule pressure as a result of the wiring bundle issue, though he said it is too early to identify specific measures under review. \"There is more than one path through the forest,\" he said. \"Just because we have established a schedule ... doesn't mean we could not better optimize that sequence of events.\" Despite the high cost to Boeing of maintaining the schedule, Thompson says he still expects it to be a profitable venture for the company. South Korea and Japan have already expressed interest in a possible buy of KC-46s. Before disclosure of the wiring bundle problems, Boeing officials maintained their estimate at completion would undercut the government's estimates. Hutcheson did not refute Thompson's estimate, but she notes that the company's charge \"is increased spending by Boeing to maintain the overall program schedule with no additional costs to the customer or taxpayer, per the contract design.\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20141031033648/http://aviationweek.com/military-government/first-flight-kc-46-tanker-platform-slips-further"}, {"title": "First flight delayed for KC-46A test aircraft", "date": "2014-09-16", "content": "The first flight of the KC-46A program's test aircraft has been pushed back until mid-to-late November, with the first next-generation tanker not expected to fly until April, the program's top officer said today. The Boeing 767-2C, a test version of the KC-46A without the refuelling boom and other tanker equipment, was expected to take flight earlier this summer, an event that was pushed back due to production issues. The first full KC-46A will now follow with its first flight in April, months after it was originally expected to fly, Maj. Gen. John Thompson, the tanker's program executive officer said Tuesday at the Air Force Association Air and Space Conference outside Washington, D.C. \"Scheduled performance has slipped a little in the last year due to the electrical work required on the first [engeinering and manufacturing development] aircraft,\" Thompson said. The question of when the engineering and manufacturing development plane will take its first flight has shadowed the program since spring, when Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, said publicly he expected the first flight by June. That never occurred, and Boeing said the flight would occur between July and September. The issue causing the delay relates tothe layout of wiring systems in the front of the jet. The aircraft has about 120 miles of electrical wire, compared with 70 miles in a commercial 767, Thompson said. The jet's electrical systems require multiple wires for the same systems to create redundancies in case of a failure. The redundant wires need to be spaced out to avoid one event - such as a fire - taking out all of the wires, Thompson said. During production, Federal Aviation Administration-certified Boeing employees found that the wires were too close together, violating both FAA and military standards. In response, workers have had to redesign the electrical layout of the jet, reinstalling 350 of 1,700 total wire bundles. \"This is not a big performance issue, this is not 'we discovered something that is not going to work,'\" Thompson said Tuesday. \"This is a compliance issue, it is something I'd much rather handle early on.\" Meanwhile, the company had to take a $272 million hit when a wiring problem was discovered over the summer. In August, Welsh expressed confidence in the program but acknowledged growing concerns about the first flight. \"If [first flight of the test plane] slips into next year, I think everybody is going to start to be concerned,\" Welsh said. \"I do not like to worry too early about things that have not happened yet. But, I think every time there is a slip in a major program, especially one that is due to deliver starting here in 2016, we want to make sure we stay on track,\" Welsh added. \"We are close to the first aircraft being delivered, and so anything that happens between now and then has an impact.\" The KC-46A is the first in a three-step process to replace the Air Force's tanker fleet, with a decision on the next step expected sometime in the 2020s. Boeing is locked into a taxpayer-friendly engineering and manufacturing development contract for the program that caps the Air Force's costs at $4.9 billion. The service is expected to field 179 of the aircraft, with delivery of the first 18 expected in 2017. The Air Force has trained 11 pilots, using Boeing's commercial 767 training program in Miami. The pilots are now stationed at Boeing Field in Seattle. Twelve boom operators are beginning training this month.

Boeing also has experienced delays in integrating the military-systems software. \"The (aerial refueling) boom that was to be installed on the first KC-46 has been delayed by eight months due to design changes and late parts deliveries,\" the GAO report states. \"Another supplier has experienced significant delays in manufacturing wing aerial refueling pods for qualification testing and development aircraft due, in part, to challenges with parts delays and engineering design changes.\" The refueling boom is a rigid tube that extends from underneath the tanker and connects to a receptacle in the crown of a refueling aircraft. The wing pods are an alternative system for offloading fuel, in which a flexible hose is extended backward from a pod on the underside of the wing to the receiving aircraft. Moog, which makes the refueling boom's actuators in Torrance, Calif., and Cobham, which makes the wing aerial-refueling pods in Davenport, Iowa, are the key suppliers of those parts. Earlier this week, the Air Force confirmed that the first flight of a tanker equipped with its refueling systems has slipped again from April, which was already three months later than planned, to sometime before the end of June. Although the GAO report was written in January before that latest schedule slip, the supply of those key military systems may be a large part of the latest holdup. Boeing tanker spokesman Chick Ramey said Boeing has designed and built the boom and has been testing it at a facility in Everett. \"We've definitely had some delays with parts,\" said Ramey. \"But we've made significant progress with suppliers,\" he added. \"We're working with them to help them improve their processes. We're sending Boeing people on site, where it makes sense, to help them.\" The GAO report also says the tanker program is struggling with integration of the software that controls the plane's military systems. \"Although all software has been delivered, Boeing is encountering more than twice the number of software problems than originally estimated,\" the GAO report states. \"As a result, Boeing delayed the start of the laboratory verification testing needed to demonstrate the defensive and aerial refueling software by more than two months.\" Boeing attributed previous delays to serious wiring issues that required the four test planes to be almost completely rewired after they were built. \"This is a large-scale development program. It's common to experience challenges,\" Ramey said. \"Issues come up. Finding and solving those issues before you fly reduces risk.\" The Air Force contract calls for Boeing to receive about $51 billion for delivering 179 tankers to the Air Force. Brig. Gen. Duke Richardson, program director for the KC-46A Pegasus tanker, said in December that Boeing was already $1.5 billion over budget on the development phase. He also said Boeing had used up \"most of the margin\" built into the schedule, which requires delivery of the first 18 tankers in 2017.

The KC-46A Pegasus is a wide-body, multi-role tanker that can refuel all US, allied and coalition military aircraft compatible with international aerial refuelling procedures. In addition, the KC-46A Tanker is designed to carry passengers, cargo and patients. The new multi role tanker was scheduled for an initial test flight in late August or early September but it is now not known how long this most recent incident will delay the commencement of test flights. The test plane, which is the company's first to be equipped with a working air refuelling system, was damaged when a mislabelled chemical was used to test the fuel system. This chemical corroded and damaged the fuel system according to a report at The Seattle Times, causing the fuel boom and auxiliary fuel tanks to be removed for inspection and repairs. In response to the situation, Boeing has named a new senior vice president Scott Fancher to oversee the tail end of the KC-46A program. According to 247wallst.com, Fancher had previously worked to get the 787 Dreamliner program back on track and then was assigned to oversee the 777X program. GAO reports continuing delays: The Government Accountability Office (GAO) made a report outlining existing delays in the KC-46A Tanker test flight schedule, published last April. \"With [US Air Force] program office approval, Boeing restructured its nearly 2,400 development flight test hour plan to focus on demonstrating key KC-46 aerial refueling capabilities required for the production decision. Significantly less testing will now be conducted prior to the decision and only three test months will be on a KC-46, compared to the original plan of 13 months. This testing is intended to demonstrate design maturity and fix design and performance problems before a system enters production. \"Boeing remains at risk of not being able to demonstrate the aerial refuelling capabilities in time to meet the new production decision date due to late parts deliveries, software defects, and flight test cycle assumptions, which could result in additional delays,\" the report explains.

Richardson said he hoped that EMD-2 would achieve a high sortie rate like its predecessor, EMD-1 (the first 767-2C baseline configuration that includes plumbing and wiring for the tanker but not the boom and pods). EMD-2 took to the skies Sept. 25. The centerline boom is designed to offload 1,200 gal. per minute to satisfy the requirement for topping off the massive C-5 airlifter. The hose-and-drogue system, designed by Cobham, is expected to offload at 400 gal. per minute. Richardson said he expects the first KC-46 receiver will be an F-16 early next year. The demonstration will also include a midair transfer of fuel to a \"heavy,\" such as a C-5 or C-17, a \"fast drogue\" system such as the F/A-18, a \"slow-boom\" receiver such as the A-10 and a \"slow drogue\" receiver such as the AV-8B.

The manufacturer is also committed to accelerating delivery of the first 18 tankers by next year. The engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) contract the Air Force awarded Boeing in 2011 called for the manufacturer to deliver 18 tankers, nine sets of wing aerial refueling pods (WARPs) and two spare engines by August this year. The parties have since modified the schedule to allow Boeing to deliver the first 18 aircraft and WARPs separately by October 2018, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated in a March report to Congress. While the program is meeting cost and performance targets, its schedule presents a risk due to potential delays in securing design certifications from the Federal Aviation Administration and completing flight-test points. Boeing must complete more than 1,700 test points per month on average from February through September, a level more than double what it completed in the last 11 months, the GAO said. Briefing reporters on the program's status on May 16 at Boeing Field, south of Seattle, KC-46 program manager Mike Gibbons was confident the manufacturer will meet the current schedule. The program is 90 percent complete with the requirements of obtaining an amended type certificate from the FAA for a 767-2C baseline freighter with tanker-system provisions, and 60 percent complete toward obtaining a supplemental type certificate for the full KC-46 tanker. The Air Force will then certify airworthiness of the military platform. \"The plan this year is just to complete that certification of the aircraft with the FAA,\" then acquire Air Force certification, Gibbons said. \"The FAA is very committed this. I work collaboratively with them every day,\" he added. \"We, the Air Force and the FAA meet and discuss this program on a monthly basis. They are very committed to making this a successful venture.\" Similarly, Gibbons said Boeing should complete all required flight-test points. \"The difference is what we have in the last phase of this testing is certification flying versus...flight testing for development and learning,\" he said. \"In the first part of flight-testing, anything we learn often times will require software tweaks and hardware modifications, which slows the pace of testing. We don't expect to have any changes that would require modifications, so the increase in test-point completion will pick up quite significantly. We've got the test points all laid out specifically and we expect to complete that testing this year.\" Boeing is currently testing six aircraft, including four EMD and two low-rate initial production (LRIP) tankers. One of the LRIP aircraft was undergoing electromagnetic effects testing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The testing was delayed because WARP supplier Cobham lagged in providing detailed design drawings the FAA requires to approve the system, according to the GAO. In January, the Air Force awarded Boeing a third LRIP contract, bringing to 34 the number of production tankers the service has ordered. There are 20 aircraft now in production. Due to a technical problem with the refueling boom design and certification issues that have delayed the developmental flight-test program, delivery of the first 18 tankers has been compressed from 14 months to six months under the current schedule. The plan is to meet that schedule, Gibbons said. \"The development is behind the original plan, but what we've not slowed down on is production overall,\" he argued. \"Our production is still going at the same rate as the original plan. Once development is complete, we will start delivering [tankers] and in very short order the U.S. Air Force will be back to the original plan.\"", "url": "https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2017-05-16/boeing-confident-meeting-kc-46-testing-delivery-targets"}, {"title": "Meet Boeing's new covert, flying gas station", "date": "2017-06-01", "content": "Boeing is set to deliver a refueling tanker that can gas up a jet in midair in complete darkness -- the first of its kind. The U.S. Air Force is buying 179of the new KC-46 'Pegasus' tankers, which are set to begin delivery at the end of this year. The Air Force has had stealthy jets for decades, but even they have to turn on their lights when refueling in the sky. The KC-46's ability to gas up an aircraft in complete darkness is a first for any military. The new jet is part of a $44 billion program to begin replacing hundreds of the Air Force's KC-135 tankers, which have been flying since the Eisenhower Administration. Boeing showed off the new Pegasus for the first time in May, inside a hangar north of Seattle. Adapted from Boeing's twin-aisle 767, each matte gray KC-46 bristles with missile defenses, high definition cameras and infrared lights for flying under the cover of night. The military brass were skeptical that refueling in pitch black could be done at all. Boeing's chief test pilot for the Pegasus, Ron Johnston, said it took years to prove it was possible. Boeing (BA) and Air Force test pilots first used the KC-46 to perform a refueling in total darkness in December. The pilots switched off all visible lights and donned night vision goggles, and an enormous C-17 cargo plane crept up behind the KC-46. The pair linked up, and history was made. The KC-46 is designed for combat. Airmen can sprint to the jet and press a single button on its exterior to start its onboard power systems, bringing the aircraft to life. The crew ascends through a hatch underneath the jet's nose and is flying in 10 minutes. No stairs needed. A refueling boom pumps 1,200 gallons every minute to Air Force jets, enough to fill a passenger car in less than a second. Two underwing pods unfurl hoses to refuel Navy, Marine and allied jets with 400 gallons per minute. The KC-46 carries just shy of 32,000 gallons of gas. Pilots have been guiding tankers using a porthole view used for the last 60 years, but that's not so with the Pegasus. Instead, this jet has a high-tech workstation with high definition stereoscopic cameras that give a 185-degree view of everything between the wingtips. 3D glasses give the boom operator a perception of depth. The numbers behind China's massive aviation market: The jet can operate around chemical and biological attacks and is designed to withstand the pulse of a nuclear blast. It has room for 114 troops, or 54 patients or 65,000 pounds of cargo. But the KC-46 is behind schedule and way over budget, according to the Government Accountability Office. Boeing was originally supposed to deliver the first 18 tankers by August, but that deadline has slipped and the GAO warns that additional delays are possible. Despite the cost overruns, the taypayer isn't on the hook. Boeing won the contract to develop the KC-46 at a fixed price of $4.9 billion, and is on the hook for any costs beyond that. The manufacturer has already had to write off $2 billion due to extensive changes it has to make in the 120 miles of wiring that each jet contains.", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/01/news/companies/boeing-pegasus-refueling-tanker/index.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "KC-46 tanker completes electromagnetic tests", "date": "2017-07-29", "content": "The U.S. Air Force's newest tanker, the KC-46A, wrapped up electromagnetic testing, putting Boeing one step closer to delivering the first aircraft, the company said Thursday.

Boeing also conducted outdoor tests that simulated the effects of electromagnetic activity on the plane while it was in flight. Boeing spokesman Charles Ramey confirmed that both the aircraft and wing air refueling pods had completed electromagnetic tests. In a report released in March, the Government Accountability Office pegged the tests as one of the two key risk factors that could keep Boeing from meeting its delivery goals - including delivering the first KC-46A to the U.S. Air Force this year and 18 tankers and nine refueling pods by the October 2018 deadline.

Gen. Carlton Everhart visited Boeing in Washington state to get a hands-on look at the Air Force's new refueling tanker. \"If everything stays on track and the weather holds, I think [Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration] can probably get everything done in the next 60 to 70 days, hopefully less,\" Everhart told Air Force Times on Wednesday after flying on the KC-46 for the first time. The four-star general, who has more than 4,500 flight hours, said he performed the takeoff and approached the landing under the guidance of test pilots. \"We get a lot of PowerPoint-deep presentations,\" he said. \"Every now and then, you've got to get out and smell the jet, look at the jet and understand what the test points are.\" In December, the FAA certified the 767-2C, which is the modified 767 commercial plane that forms the basis of the KC-46. This Amended Type Certificate verifies that the fundamental design of the tanker is safe, and it's one of two FAA certifications required for the tanker program. The Supplemental Type Certificate focuses on the military-specific equipment that's installed on the 767-2C aircraft to make it a tanker. In addition to the two FAA certifications, the KC-46 requires an Air Force-issued Military Type Certification that validates the airworthiness and safety of the military systems and equipment installed on the new tanker, AMC officials said. Everhart estimates it will take about a month or so for Boeing to complete the testing required for the Supplemental Type Certificate. Then Boeing will turn the data over to the FAA, which should take about another month to give it the stamp of approval. One purpose of Everhart's visit focused on assessing the flying quality and performance of the tanker, which Everhart praised. \"I have flown airplanes that were older than I was when I came into military service,\" said Everhart, whose flying experience includes the C-17 and C-130 transport planes. The modernized airframe and responsiveness of the KC-46 impressed Everhart, who said it has game-changing technology, including more automation so pilots can focus on the mission. The tanker also has the potential to add new technology as it continues to develop, he said. Everhart also wanted to check out the Remote Visual System, which allows the boom operator to sit near the front of the KC-46 and remotely operate the boom during mid-air refueling. The system was linked to one of the deficiencies discovered during testing. This deficiency involved reports of the tanker's boom scraping the receiving aircraft during mid-air refueling. The boom, which extends into a receptacle on the receiving aircraft, in some cases was making contact outside of the receptacle and scratching the other plane. This could damage the receiving aircraft, especially if the KC-46 is refueling stealth jets like the F-22 and F-35 that are covered in a special coating. During testing, some of the boom contacts made outside of the receptacle were not detected by the boom operators through the visual system, AMC spokesman Col. Chris Karns said. Boeing's software engineers are working to enhance the Remote Visual System so boom operators can prevent these contacts, Everhart said, adding that sometimes the camera view is washed out because of the sun. \"[The engineers] are changing the contrast of how the visuals work with the camera to facilitate a view of the boom and receptacle,\" Everhart said. Part of it could also be an issue of making sure boom operators are properly trained on the Remote Visual System. \"Because you're not lying back there [where you can actually see the boom],\" Everhart said. \"You're looking through a camera.\" Another of the deficiencies involved an \"uncommanded boom extension,\" where the boom has unexpectedly extended after refueling is stopped. A software fix is expected to resolve this deficiency by the spring, Karns said. The third open deficiency deals with ensuring that the high-frequency radio remains off during refueling, and options are being developed to address this, he said. \"A lot of energy is being put towards this program by Boeing and the Air Force to deliver the aircraft this year,\" Karns said. Boeing had originally planned on delivering the first KC-46 to the Air Force by the end of 2017, but now the plan is to deliver the first tanker by late spring. The Air Force plans to buy 179 of the aircraft, and Boeing is contractually obligated to deliver the first 18 certified tankers by October. McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas and Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma will be the first to receive the KC-46, which will replace the KC-135 Stratotankers. The KC-135 fleet is on average 55 years old, Karns said, adding that maintaining America's military advantage over adversaries requires modern tankers. In November, Russia's United Aircraft Corporation rolled out an upgraded tanker designed to replace its legacy aircraft. \"The new Russian tanker will have increased fuel capacity,\" Karns said. \"Russia and China recognize the strategic benefits of extending their reach and are prioritizing fielding enhanced aerial tanker capability.\" After Everhart's visit to Boeing, he said he believes they're still on track to deliver the first tanker by this spring. He's asked Maj. Gen. John Wood, Air Mobility Command's director of strategic plans, requirements and programs, to go back out to Boeing at some point. \"I need the more people I can to see the airplane,\" Everhart said. \"It will bring tremendous capability to our joint war fighter.\"", "url": "https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2018/01/25/the-air-forces-kc-46-tanker-is-almost-ready-for-primetime/"}, {"title": "Air Force and Boeing KC-46 tanker program facing questions about EMP", "date": "2018-01-30", "content": " The Pentagon's office of operational test and evaluation says the Air Force's new KC-46A Pegasus tanker may not be fully resistant to an electromagnetic pulse.

While the KC-46's role is to refuel other aircraft, it too may need to be refueled from KC-10 Extenders or KC-135 Stratotankers to extend its range. \"The primary focus of the current test effort is certifying the KC-46 as a receiver aircraft behind the KC-135,\" said Lt. Col. Paul Calhoun, 418th FLTS commander. \"As a fully air-refuelable tanker, the KC-46 offers the warfighter increased flexibility. Testing being accomplished at Edwards now will enable that capability.\" Several units from both on and off base are supporting the tests with the 412th Test Wing as the lead developmental test organization for the KC-46 program. \"The KC-46 is still an experimental aircraft owned by Boeing so they brought with them an army of engineers, maintainers and aircrew. This is a team effort across the entire test wing and with Boeing,\" Calhoun said. The KC-46A has visited Edwards for tests before and tests have been conducted at its Boeing home in Washington state, but this visit aims to be the start of a more robust test schedule to be conducted in the High Desert. \"While the KC-46 has done some remote testing at other bases, this is the beginning of a new chapter in its development where Edwards personnel can directly test the Air Force's newest aircraft on site at the world's premier flight test location,\" said Calhoun.

That franchise now looks likely to continue through the end of the century. Air Force officials stress that there is still much work to be done, but public discussion of the program is now likely to begin migrating from a focus on development challenges to the intricacies of operating the fielded aircraft.

Rather than celebrate the tanker milestone - at the end of an 18-year wait that began with a procurement scandal and continued through a bitterly fought political battle to wrest the contract away from Airbus - the Air Force issued a short statement critical of the remaining shortfalls in the tanker's capability. And actual delivery of the jet to McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kan., now three years late, is still weeks away. Air Force officials are particularly dissatisfied with problems that have surfaced during flight tests of the new camera system Boeing has installed for operating the tanker's refueling boom. With this new \"remote vision system,\" designed to work even in total darkness, the boom operator sits at a terminal behind the cockpit and by watching on a computer screen guides the boom toward a jet approaching to accept fuel. During flight tests, operators have had difficulty seeing the approaching jet with sufficient precision in certain lighting conditions - when the sun is low and glare reflects off the receiving aircraft, and also when the sun is behind the tanker and casts deep shadows on the receiver. \"We have identified, and Boeing has agreed to fix at its expense, deficiencies discovered in developmental testing of the remote vision system,\" the Air Force said, adding that it \"has mechanisms in place to ensure Boeing meets its contractual obligations while we continue with initial operational testing and evaluation.\" Capt. Hope Cronin, USAF spokeswoman, said the Air Force is withholding up to $28 million from the final payment on each aircraft until Boeing makes the necessary fixes. She said that in recent months the Air Force and Boeing have worked closely on five major KC-46 system deficiencies and in November downgraded two of those to a less-serious status. The deficiencies included a problem with aircraft refueling using the hose from the center fuselage, which has occasionally disconnected during the process. Cronin said \"the toughest challenges\" were the remote vision system and the boom actuators, which extend the refueling boom. \"Each required significant engineering work,\" she said. A joint Air Force-Boeing team developed fixes \"that fully meet mission requirements\" but involved \"operational workarounds.\" Cronin said Boeing agreed to make further improvements to the remote vision system so that it will operate properly without the workarounds. \"The Air Force will update the boom to meet more stringent requirements,\" Cronin said. \"Corrective actions (to fix the flawed systems) are in work and are expected to take approximately 3-4 years to complete.\" The Air Force will nevertheless continue to take delivery of the planes in the meantime, as it has determined the remaining deficiencies \"do not prevent the tanker from carrying out its primary mission,\" she added. In the past six months, Boeing has twice taken multimillion-dollar write-offs for the tanker program, bringing the budget overrun to date to $3.6 billion, all of which has to be covered by the manufacturer. According to a person familiar with the plans, Boeing and the Air Force will hold formal delivery events in the coming weeks at both Everett, where the tanker is built, and at McConnell AFB. The Air Force said this will be no earlier than late January. Boeing issued a much more positive news release Thursday, but one that lacked a single supportive quote from any Air Force official. Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg declared it an \"exciting and historic day for the Air Force and Boeing.\" And Leanne Caret, head of Boeing's Defense and Space division, thanked \"the men and women of the Air Force and across the Boeing tanker team who made this happen.\" Last May, contradicting open pessimism at the Defense Department about the tanker timetable, Caret confidently predicted that Boeing would deliver 18 tankers to the Air Force by the end of 2018. \"We are on the cusp of delivery,\" Caret said then. But delays to the first delivery mounted, even as Boeing continued building planes. Some 40 tankers are either in advanced stages of production in Everett or are parked at Boeing Field. About 4,000 Boeing employees in the state work on the tanker program. Boeing said the first four KC-46 aircraft, destined to go to McConnell to begin operational testing, are all \"ready for delivery,\" as are four more that will go to Oklahoma's Altus Air Force Base for aircrew and maintenance training \"beginning as early as next month.\" The Air Force first asked for new tankers in 2001. An initial sole-source leasing deal for 100 Boeing 767 tankers drew heavy criticism in Congress. It was canceled after the revelation that the procurement process had been corrupt, which led to the resignation of Boeing's then-chairman and cheif executive Phil Condit and landed its then-chief financial officer, Mike Sears, in jail. When the procurement process was reopened, a new tanker contract was initially awarded to Airbus in 2008. After a prolonged saga of political controversy and formal contract protests overturned that result, Boeing finally secured the replacement KC-46 contract seven years ago. The government estimates it will spend $41 billion on development of the KC-46 and the purchase of a total of 179 tankers. Of that, approximately $30 billion will go to Boeing, according to the company's annual report. However, the contract has a fixed price, with costs for this development stage capped at $4.9 billion, a figure long surpassed. All further development costs beyond that have been coming out of Boeing's pocket. Boeing is scrambling to fix the remaining issues and keep the cost overruns from climbing toward $4 billion. A person familiar with the plans said Boeing hopes to deliver at least a dozen tankers in the first quarter of the year.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190111232805/https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/the-air-force-finally-takes-ownership-of-its-first-boeing-tanker-with-some-misgivings/"}, {"title": "Boeing delivers first KC-46, but fixes to technical problems still years away", "date": "2019-01-10", "content": "After more than a year of delays, the U.S. Air Force took hold of its first KC-46 tanker on Jan. 10, but it will take several years for the service and manufacturer Boeing to reconcile major technical problems, and the company will not be receiving the full amount of money due upon delivery. The agreement, finalized after months of sometimes public and contentious discussions, allows McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas to receive the KC-46 as early as this month, with more set to follow, said Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Hope Cronin. However, the new tankers will arrive with several outstanding category-1 deficiencies, the term used by the military to describe the most serious level of technical problems. That may sound like a blow to the Air Force, whose leaders had previously implied that all category-1 deficiencies must be fixed before the service begins accepting the tankers. However, service leaders believe the Air Force retains significant financial leverage, even as Boeing delivers the KC-46 aircraft, and the service sees it as vital that Air Mobility Command be able to begin training pilots and boom operators to use the tankers even as technical problems are being corrected. \"Despite all the flaws, there is operational utility of the system,\" an Air Force official told Defense News. \"KC-46 has a lot of systems that our legacy tankers don't that in a contested fight you might want. It has improved situational awareness and battle management and protection.\" Perhaps more importantly, the Air Force holds a significant trump card in its hand. According to the terms of its fixed-price contract with Boeing, the service can withhold up to $28 million per aircraft upon delivery - and the Air Force official said the service intends to keep that amount until it sees a good faith effort by Boeing to fix deficiencies. That means Boeing could miss out on $1.5 billion if the maximum withholding is applied to all 52 aircraft on contract. \"That is not something that legitimately can be contested by Boeing. That is purely a government decision until the airplane is brought up to specification,\" the official said. In a statement, Boeing hailed the Air Force's decision to accept the KC-46. \"The KC-46A is a proven, safe, multi-mission aircraft that will transform aerial refueling and mobility operations for decades to come,\" said Leanne Caret, president and chief executive of Boeing's defense business. \"We look forward to working with the Air Force, and the Navy, during their initial operational test and evaluation of the KC-46, as we further demonstrate the operational capabilities of this next-generation aircraft across refueling, mobility and combat weapons systems missions.\" Two key problems: Before the Air Force would accept the first KC-46, Boeing and the service first had to come to terms on the aircraft's remote vision system, or RVS, the most significant technical hurdle that had bogged down talks between the parties. In short, Boeing has agreed to embark on a redesign effort for the Rockwell Collins-designed RVS that will involve both hardware and software changes. The Air Force believes it will take three to four years to develop a fully functioning RVS, and Boeing has agreed to fix it at its own expense, Cronin said. Unlike legacy tankers, where boom operators could see out a window in the back of the aircraft and rely on visual cues to guide the boom into the receptacle, the boom operator in a KC-46 works at stations in the front of the aircraft, relying on the RVS' series of cameras and sensors. However, Air Force test communities have complained that certain lighting conditions cause the imagery provided to the boom operator to be misleading, contributing to cases where the boomer accidentally scrapes the skin of the receiver aircraft. For aircraft with low-observable coating, such mistakes could result in the loss of stealth and a hefty repair bill. Boeing previously maintained it could update its software to fix RVS problems, while the service was more reluctant to put its faith in that proposed solution. To better understand the RVS, the Air Force formed a team that included personnel from Boeing, Air Mobility Command, the Air Force's acquisition wing and the Human Performance Wing at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which studied how the imagery from the RVS was perceived and internalized by boom operators. For example, \"there is a slight difference between the motion viewed in the RVS versus what is actually occurring in the physical world. All of those things can create a depth compression and curvature effect\" where boom operators might overcorrect their movement based on what they are seeing on screen, an Air Force official explained. Once the Air Force was able to understand how the RVS distorted imagery under certain conditions, the service was able to more firmly articulate the requirements Boeing must meet for an acceptable RVS, but those parameters will surely entail hardware changes - potentially very extensive ones. However, the Air Force also made key concessions. Namely, it will have to pay for another fix using taxpayer money. During tests, the Air Force found that certain aircraft - most often, the A-10 Warthog - had trouble generating the necessary thrust to push into the boom for refueling. Boeing presented a boom design to the government at Milestone C that set the boom resistance to the international standard of about 1,400 pounds, which the government accepted, the Air Force official said. The problem is that to refuel the A-10, the boom must have a much lower threshold of thrust resistance, around 650 pounds. Because the Air Force is asking for a change in requirements, it has agreed to fund the additional work - though it is still working out how much it will cost for the redesign work and retrofits, the official said. That redesign and manufacturing process will probably take about two years. Tanker deficiencies: The delivery of the first KC-46 is a huge milestone for Boeing, which won a $4.9 billion fixed-price contract for the tanker program in 2011 after a protracted and controversial battle against Airbus. The company was due to deliver the first 18 KC-46s to the Air Force in August 2017, allowing the service to declare the aircraft operational. But numerous technical issues were found that have delayed that milestone and driven up the price of the program. After months of discussions with the Air Force, the service and Boeing came to an agreement in late 2018 that stipulated the way forward on KC-46, including a path to close deficiencies and a plan for the first KC-46 delivery. The compromise would allow Boeing to get the tanker off its books by the end of the year - something the company has held that it could accomplish after missing the deadline several times since 2017 - but first, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would have to approve the approach. When in December he announced he would resign, and then was forced by President Donald Trump to leave his role by the end of the year, momentum on the tanker delivery stalled. Ellen Lord, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, signed off on the KC-46 acceptance on Thursday. \"The Department of Defense is in complete agreement regarding moving forward with delivery of KC-46 tankers,\" said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mike Andrews. \"The department remains committed to providing the most cost-effective platforms for the U.S. taxpayer, while still delivering the best capabilities to our men and women serving in uniform.\" Boeing has been forced to pay more than $3 billion from the company's accounts as a result of cost overruns. However, some of the more serious technical problems appear to be on the mend. The Air Force downgraded two category-1 deficiencies to category-2 status after a Nov. 7 meeting of the deficiency review board. A category-2 deficiency is a serious technical issue for which there is a workaround in place. One of the deficiencies involved forces on the boom as it made contact with an aircraft, raising concerns that it was nearing its maximum loads. However, with further analysis, Boeing determined the boom was experiencing at most 45 percent of its maximum loads, and the Air Force ruled that the deficiency could be downgraded as Boeing revises its software. The other deficiency occurred when the centerline drogue system experiences an increase in tension and disconnects from a receiver aircraft without being commanded to by the boom operator. The issue was observed during tests of multiple KC-46 tankers with two different F/A-18 Hornets acting as receivers. To fix that problem, Boeing proved out a software fix that was then implemented throughout the existing KC-46 inventory, the company said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2019/01/10/boeing-delivers-first-kc-46-but-fixes-to-technical-problems-still-years-away/"}, {"title": "USAF accepts first KC-46A Pegasus tanker aircraft despite deficiencies", "date": "2019-01-11", "content": "The US Air Force is set to receive the first four KC-46 aircraft as early as late January.

The center is tasked with developing the USAF's Rapid Global Mobility and expeditionary Agile Combat Support training and education, while also providing direct oversight for the Global Air Mobility Support System and installation support, contingency response, and building partnership capacity mission sets within the global mobility enterprise. Leadership of the U.S. Air Force Expeditionary Center was officially passed to its newest commander, Maj. Gen. Mark Camerer, last week. \"Gen. Camerer is all about developing Airmen and building the force that will compete, deter, and win today, and tomorrow - he is absolutely the right person to lead the Expeditionary Center into the future,\" said Air Mobility Command commander Gen. Jacqueline D. Van Ovost, who presided over the ceremony. \"I have absolute faith and confidence he is the perfect leader to build upon [Maj. Gen. John Gordy's] foundation and accelerate this command into the future.\" Camerer's nearly 30-year career has included various positions at the squadron, group, wing, major command and combatant command levels. Prior to his current command, he was the Director of Strategic Plans, Requirements and Programs, Headquarters Air Mobility Command, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. During a ceremony last Wednesday, Camerer addressed the nearly 14,000 airmen of the Expeditionary Center and spoke of his commitment to the men, women, and families of the base. \"'I assume command..' They are more than three ceremonial words, they represent the commitment to the men, women and families of the Expeditionary Center that I make today,\" Camerer said. \"They instantly and profoundly link Julie and me to an awesome military organization.\" The center represents a major aspect of the base's mission, now tasked with building key relationships with the Army, the Navy, Marine Corps. and the Space Force, as well as international partners. The goal, simply put, is to allow the U.S. military to rapidly move anything to any destination on the planet, Camerer said. Airmen of the Expeditionary Center \"provide our nation with the strategic advantage that is coveted by our senior leaders, respected by our allies, and cannot be matched by our adversaries.\" The Joint Base's McGuire portion hosts the Boeing C-17 heavy transport, Lockheed C-130 turboprop utility transport plane, and the Boeing KC-10 and KC-135 tankers. The Joint Base will eventually host the Air Force's new KC-46 Pegasus tankers, which have been laden with unresolved issues that prevent them from being deployed except in a national emergency. The platform, based on the civilian Boeing 767 airliner, is due to replace aging tankers, including the base's KC-10 and KC-135 models that are decades old. Becoming home to the KC-46 platform, while delayed, ensures the base is likely to continue to remain open for years to come. Van Ovost recently met directly with Boeing executives two weeks ago to discuss the ongoing issues, most notably fuel leaks and foreign objects being found inside newly-delivered aircraft hulls. The KC-46 will form the backbone of America's air-to-air refueling mission in the future, and will be able to tackle missions involving the boom fuel delivery system found on U.S. Air Force jets as well as the probe-and-drogue systems utilized by U.S. Navy jets as well as those in most foreign allied air arms. The KC-46 was chosen over the Northrop-Grumman KC-45, a proposed American variant of the Airbus A330 MRTT. Once the kinks are worked out, the center's new commander will be responsible for helping the plane and those who operate them accomplish what is normally referred to as a \"no fail\" mission. \"I am humbled to join this amazing team,\" said Camerer. \"I understand the responsibility that I am shouldering and I know the strategic importance of the Expeditionary Center, together we will continue to put the rapid in rapid global mobility as we deliver air power - from the ground up!\"", "url": "https://brick.shorebeat.com/2020/09/new-leader-appointed-to-run-major-operation-at-joint-base-mdl-officials-meet-over-kc-46-woes/"}, {"title": "Pentagon official blames contract for KC-46 tanker woes, Army ", "date": "2020-10-01", "content": "Nearly a decade of delays in the U.S. Air Force's KC-46 tanker program are partially the Pentagon's fault for insisting on a contract that made Boeing eat the costs of development problems, the military's top acquisition official told lawmakers on Thursday. \"I fundamentally think that the root cause of this is the contract type that was awarded for this,\" Ellen Lord, defense undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment, told the Senate Armed Services Readiness and Management Support subcommittee.

The Department of Defense has tentatively decided to place 24 new KC-46 Pegasus tanker aircraft at MacDill Air Force Base, ending years of speculation about the fate of the base's aging KC-135 Stratotanker fleet. Some of the KC-135 tankers at MacDill were built in the 1950s and 60s, during the Eisenhower administration. The planes are much older than the people who now fly them, making the announcement of an upgrade - a welcome one. \"We will be able to maintain the missions of MacDill Air Force Base for decades to come,\" Rep.

The 568th AMXS, a Federal Aviation Administration-designated military repair station for commercial derivative aircraft, completed the depot maintenance milestone over a year after the first KC-46A landed at Tinker Air Force Base in September 2020, the Air Force said Monday. The achievement also came despite the Boeing 767-based aircraft still being in its initial operational test and evaluation phase, given that most depot maintenance programs start only after a vehicle reaches initial operational capability. It marks the first year of depot production at Tinker, where a $755 million KC-46A sustainment campus is being built with a planned 14 docks, engine test cell, systems integration laboratory and administration space.
